| **[Knowledge-aware contrastive heterogeneous molecular graph learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11711v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular representation learning is pivotal in predicting molecular properties and advancing drug design. Traditional methodologies, which predominantly rely on homogeneous graph encoding, are limited by their inability to integrate external knowledge and represent molecular structures across different levels of granularity. To address these limitations, we propose a paradigm shift by encoding molecular graphs into heterogeneous structures, introducing a novel framework: Knowledge-aware Contrastive Heterogeneous Molecular Graph Learning (KCHML). This approach leverages contrastive learning to enrich molecular representations with embedded external knowledge. KCHML conceptualizes molecules through three distinct graph views-molecular, elemental, and pharmacological-enhanced by heterogeneous molecular graphs and a dual message-passing mechanism. This design offers a comprehensive representation for property prediction, as well as for downstream tasks such as drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates KCHML's superiority over state-of-the-art molecular property prediction models, underscoring its ability to capture intricate molecular features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-View Orthogonal Projection Regression with Application in Multi-omics integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16807v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-omics integration offers novel insights into complex biological mechanisms by utlizing the fused information from various omics datasets. However, the inherent within- and inter-modality correlations in multi-omics data present significant challenges for traditional variable selection methods, such as Lasso regression. These correlations can lead to multicollinearity, compromising the stability and interpretability of selected variables. To address these problems, we introduce the Multi-View Orthogonal Projection Regression (MVOPR), a novel approach for variable selection in multi-omics analysis. MVOPR leverages the unidirectional associations among omics layers, inspired by the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, to transform predictors into an uncorrelated feature space. This orthogonal projection framework effectively mitigates the correlations, allowing penalized regression models to operate on independent components. Through simulations under both well-specified and misspecified scenarios, MVOPR demonstrates superior performance in variable selection, outperforming traditional Lasso-based methods and factor-based models. In real-data analysis on the CAARS dataset, MVOPR consistently identifies biologically relevant features, including the Bacteroidaceae family and key metabolites which align well with known asthma biomarkers. These findings illustrate MVOPR's ability to enhance variable selection while offering biologically interpretable insights, offering a robust tool for integrative multi-omics research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advances in Protein Representation Learning: Methods, Applications, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16659v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proteins are complex biomolecules that play a central role in various biological processes, making them critical targets for breakthroughs in molecular biology, medical research, and drug discovery. Deciphering their intricate, hierarchical structures, and diverse functions is essential for advancing our understanding of life at the molecular level. Protein Representation Learning (PRL) has emerged as a transformative approach, enabling the extraction of meaningful computational representations from protein data to address these challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of PRL research, categorizing methodologies into five key areas: feature-based, sequence-based, structure-based, multimodal, and complex-based approaches. To support researchers in this rapidly evolving field, we introduce widely used databases for protein sequences, structures, and functions, which serve as essential resources for model development and evaluation. We also explore the diverse applications of these approaches in multiple domains, demonstrating their broad impact. Finally, we discuss pressing technical challenges and outline future directions to advance PRL, offering insights to inspire continued innovation in this foundational field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing the Scalability and Applicability of Kohn-Sham Hamiltonians for Molecular Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19227v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a pivotal method within quantum chemistry and materials science, with its core involving the construction and solution of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Despite its importance, the application of DFT is frequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to construct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current research has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and solid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural networks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when applied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of ground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger training set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable model for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce a loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction Alignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the predicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting differences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing models to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies than previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates self-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations. Here, we show it achieves a reduction in total energy prediction error by a factor of 1347 and an SCF calculation speed-up by a factor of 18%. These substantial improvements set new benchmarks for achieving accurate and applicable predictions in larger molecular systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal Foundation Models for Computational Pathology: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09091v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in computational pathology (CPath), enabling scalable and generalizable analysis of histopathological images. While early developments centered on uni-modal models trained solely on visual data, recent advances have highlighted the promise of multi-modal foundation models that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as textual reports, structured domain knowledge, and molecular profiles. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of multi-modal foundation models in CPath, with a particular focus on models built upon hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) and tile-level representations. We categorize 32 state-of-the-art multi-modal foundation models into three major paradigms: vision-language, vision-knowledge graph, and vision-gene expression. We further divide vision-language models into non-LLM-based and LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we analyze 28 available multi-modal datasets tailored for pathology, grouped into image-text pairs, instruction datasets, and image-other modality pairs. Our survey also presents a taxonomy of downstream tasks, highlights training and evaluation strategies, and identifies key challenges and future directions. We aim for this survey to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of pathology and AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Filters reveal emergent structure in computational morphogenesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16211v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Revolutionary advances in both manufacturing and computational morphogenesis raise critical questions about design sensitivity. Sensitivity questions are especially critical in contexts, such as topology optimization, that yield structures with emergent morphology. However, analyzing emergent structures via conventional, perturbative techniques can mask larger-scale vulnerabilities that could manifest in essential components. Risks that fail to appear in perturbative sensitivity analyses will only continue to proliferate as topology optimization-driven manufacturing penetrates more deeply into engineering design and consumer products. Here, we introduce Laplace-transform based computational filters that supplement computational morphogenesis with a set of nonperturbative sensitivity analyses. We demonstrate how this approach identifies important elements of a structure even in the absence of knowledge of the ultimate, optimal structure itself. We leverage techniques from molecular dynamics and implement these methods in open-source codes, demonstrating their application to compliance minimization problems in both 2D and 3D. Our implementation extends straightforwardly to topology optimization for other problems and benefits from the strong scaling properties observed in conventional molecular simulation.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Machine Learning-Based Genomic Linguistic Analysis (Gene Sequence Feature Learning): A Case Study on Predicting Heavy Metal Response Genes in Rice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16582v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the application of machine learning-based genetic linguistics for identifying heavy metal response genes in rice (Oryza sativa). By integrating convolutional neural networks and random forest algorithms, we developed a hybrid model capable of extracting and learning meaningful features from gene sequences, such as k-mer frequencies and physicochemical properties. The model was trained and tested on datasets of genes, achieving high predictive performance (precision: 0.89, F1-score: 0.82). RNA-seq and qRT-PCR experiments conducted on rice leaves which exposed to Hg0, revealed differential expression of genes associated with heavy metal responses, which validated the model's predictions. Co-expression network analysis identified 103 related genes, and a literature review indicated that these genes are highly likely to be involved in heavy metal-related biological processes. By integrating and comparing the analysis results with those of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the validity of the new machine learning method was further demonstrated. This study highlights the efficacy of combining machine learning with genetic linguistics for large-scale gene prediction. It demonstrates a cost-effective and efficient approach for uncovering molecular mechanisms underlying heavy metal responses, with potential applications in developing stress-tolerant crop varieties.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphXForm: Graph transformer for computer-aided molecular design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01667v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative deep learning has become pivotal in molecular design for drug discovery, materials science, and chemical engineering. A widely used paradigm is to pretrain neural networks on string representations of molecules and fine-tune them using reinforcement learning on specific objectives. However, string-based models face challenges in ensuring chemical validity and enforcing structural constraints like the presence of specific substructures. We propose to instead combine graph-based molecular representations, which can naturally ensure chemical validity, with transformer architectures, which are highly expressive and capable of modeling long-range dependencies between atoms. Our approach iteratively modifies a molecular graph by adding atoms and bonds, which ensures chemical validity and facilitates the incorporation of structural constraints. We present GraphXForm, a decoder-only graph transformer architecture, which is pretrained on existing compounds and then fine-tuned using a new training algorithm that combines elements of the deep cross-entropy method and self-improvement learning. We evaluate GraphXForm on various drug design tasks, demonstrating superior objective scores compared to state-of-the-art molecular design approaches. Furthermore, we apply GraphXForm to two solvent design tasks for liquid-liquid extraction, again outperforming alternative methods while flexibly enforcing structural constraints or initiating design from existing molecular structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Digital Discovery, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Chem42: a Family of chemical Language Models for Target-aware Ligand Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16563v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Revolutionizing drug discovery demands more than just understanding molecular interactions - it requires generative models that can design novel ligands tailored to specific biological targets. While chemical Language Models (cLMs) have made strides in learning molecular properties, most fail to incorporate target-specific insights, restricting their ability to drive de-novo ligand generation. Chem42, a cutting-edge family of generative chemical Language Models, is designed to bridge this gap. By integrating atomic-level interactions with multimodal inputs from Prot42, a complementary protein Language Model, Chem42 achieves a sophisticated cross-modal representation of molecular structures, interactions, and binding patterns. This innovative framework enables the creation of structurally valid, synthetically accessible ligands with enhanced target specificity. Evaluations across diverse protein targets confirm that Chem42 surpasses existing approaches in chemical validity, target-aware design, and predicted binding affinity. By reducing the search space of viable drug candidates, Chem42 could accelerate the drug discovery pipeline, offering a powerful generative AI tool for precision medicine. Our Chem42 models set a new benchmark in molecule property prediction, conditional molecule generation, and target-aware ligand design. The models are publicly available at huggingface.co/inceptionai.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network Embedding Exploration Tool (NEExT)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15853v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world and artificial systems and processes can be represented as graphs. Some examples of such systems include social networks, financial transactions, supply chains, and molecular structures. In many of these cases, one needs to consider a collection of graphs, rather than a single network. This could be a collection of distinct but related graphs, such as different protein structures or graphs resulting from dynamic processes on the same network. Examples of the latter include the evolution of social networks, community-induced graphs, or ego-nets around various nodes. A significant challenge commonly encountered is the absence of ground-truth labels for graphs or nodes, necessitating the use of unsupervised techniques to analyze such systems. Moreover, even when ground-truth labels are available, many existing graph machine learning methods depend on complex deep learning models, complicating model explainability and interpretability. To address some of these challenges, we have introduced NEExT (Network Embedding Exploration Tool) for embedding collections of graphs via user-defined node features. The advantages of the framework are twofold: (i) the ability to easily define your own interpretable node-based features in view of the task at hand, and (ii) fast embedding of graphs provided by the Vectorizers library. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of NEExT on collections of synthetic and real-world graphs. For supervised tasks, we demonstrate that performance in graph classification tasks could be achieved similarly to other state-of-the-art techniques while maintaining model interpretability. Furthermore, our framework can also be used to generate high-quality embeddings in an unsupervised way, where target variables are not available.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Using machine learning to map simulated noisy and laser-limited multidimensional spectra to molecular electronic couplings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15706v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has enabled significant discoveries in both biological and synthetic energy-transducing systems. Although deriving chemical information from 2DES is a complex task, machine learning (ML) offers exciting opportunities to translate complicated spectroscopic data into physical insight. Recent studies have found that neural networks (NNs) can map simulated multidimensional spectra to molecular-scale properties with high accuracy. However, simulations often do not capture experimental factors that influence real spectra, including noise and suboptimal pulse resonance conditions, bringing into question the experimental utility of NNs trained on simulated data. Here, we show how factors associated with experimental 2D spectral data influence the ability of NNs to map simulated 2DES spectra onto underlying intermolecular electronic couplings. By systematically introducing multisourced noise into a library of 356000 simulated 2D spectra, we show that noise does not hamper NN performance for spectra exceeding threshold signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) (> 6.6 if background noise dominates vs. > 2.5 for intensity-dependent noise). In stark contrast to human-based analyses of 2DES data, we find that the NN accuracy improves significantly (ca. 84% $\rightarrow$ 96%) when the data are constrained by the bandwidth and center frequency of the pump pulses. This result is consistent with the NN learning the optical trends described by Kasha's theory of molecular excitons. Our findings convey positive prospects for adapting simulation-trained NNs to extract molecular properties from inherently imperfect experimental 2DES data. More broadly, we propose that machine-learned perspectives of nonlinear spectroscopic data may produce unique and, perhaps, counterintuitive guidelines for experimental design.</p></details> | 24 pages, 15 figures |
| **[LuGo: an Enhanced Quantum Phase Estimation Implementation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15439v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cardinal algorithm in quantum computing that plays a crucial role in various applications, including cryptography, molecular simulation, and solving systems of linear equations. However, the standard implementation of QPE faces challenges related to time complexity and circuit depth, which limit its practicality for large-scale computations. We introduce LuGo, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of QPE by reducing redundant circuit duplication, as well as parallelization techniques to achieve faster circuit generation and gate reduction. We validate the effectiveness of our framework by generating quantum linear solver circuits, which require both QPE and inverse QPE, to solve linear systems of equations. LuGo achieves significant improvements in both computational efficiency and hardware requirements while maintaining high accuracy. Compared to a standard QPE implementation, LuGo reduces time consumption to solve a $2^6\times 2^6$ system matrix by a factor of $50.68$ and over $31\times$ reduction of quantum gates and circuit depth, with no fidelity loss on an ideal quantum simulator. With these advantages, LuGo paves the way for more efficient implementations of QPE, enabling broader applications across several quantum computing domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensemble Knowledge Distillation for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14293v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are a promising tool to accelerate atomistic simulations and molecular property prediction. The quality of MLIPs strongly depends on the quantity of available training data as well as the quantum chemistry (QC) level of theory used to generate that data. Datasets generated with high-fidelity QC methods, such as coupled cluster, are typically restricted to small molecules and may be missing energy gradients. With this limited quantity of data, it is often difficult to train good MLIP models. We present an ensemble knowledge distillation (EKD) method to improve MLIP accuracy when trained to energy-only datasets. In our EKD approach, first, multiple teacher models are trained to QC energies and then used to generate atomic forces for all configurations in the dataset. Next, a student MLIP is trained to both QC energies and to ensemble-averaged forces generated by the teacher models. We apply this workflow on the ANI-1ccx dataset which consists of organic molecules with configuration energies computed at the coupled cluster level of theory. The resulting student MLIPs achieve new state-of-the-art accuracy on the out-of-sample COMP6 benchmark and improved stability for molecular dynamics simulations. The EKD approach for MLIP is broadly applicable for chemical, biomolecular and materials science simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine learning surrogate models of many-body dispersion interactions in polymer melts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15149v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of many-body dispersion (MBD) interactions is essential for understanding the van der Waals forces that govern the behavior of many complex molecular systems. However, the high computational cost of MBD calculations limits their direct application in large-scale simulations. In this work, we introduce a machine learning surrogate model specifically designed to predict MBD forces in polymer melts, a system that demands accurate MBD description and offers structural advantages for machine learning approaches. Our model is based on a trimmed SchNet architecture that selectively retains the most relevant atomic connections and incorporates trainable radial basis functions for geometric encoding. We validate our surrogate model on datasets from polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride melts, demonstrating high predictive accuracy and robust generalization across diverse polymer systems. In addition, the model captures key physical features, such as the characteristic decay behavior of MBD interactions, providing valuable insights for optimizing cutoff strategies. Characterized by high computational efficiency, our surrogate model enables practical incorporation of MBD effects into large-scale molecular simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChemVLM: Exploring the Power of Multimodal Large Language Models in Chemistry Area](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07246v4)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and have been applied across various scientific fields, including chemistry. However, many chemical tasks require the processing of visual information, which cannot be successfully handled by existing chemical LLMs. This brings a growing need for models capable of integrating multimodal information in the chemical domain. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ChemVLM}, an open-source chemical multimodal large language model specifically designed for chemical applications. ChemVLM is trained on a carefully curated bilingual multimodal dataset that enhances its ability to understand both textual and visual chemical information, including molecular structures, reactions, and chemistry examination questions. We develop three datasets for comprehensive evaluation, tailored to Chemical Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Chemical Reasoning (MMCR), and Multimodal Molecule Understanding tasks. We benchmark ChemVLM against a range of open-source and proprietary multimodal large language models on various tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ChemVLM achieves competitive performance across all evaluated tasks. Our model can be found at https://huggingface.co/AI4Chem/ChemVLM-26B.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, updated version</p></details> |
| **[Towards Unified Latent Space for 3D Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15567v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRROR: Multi-Modal Pathological Self-Supervised Representation Learning via Modality Alignment and Retention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00374v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology and transcriptomics are fundamental modalities in oncology, encapsulating the morphological and molecular aspects of the disease. Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Controlling Peak Sharpness in Multimodal Biomolecular Systems via the Chemical Fokker-Planck Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14706v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intracellular biomolecular systems exhibit intrinsic stochasticity due to low molecular copy numbers, leading to multimodal probability distributions that play a crucial role in probabilistic differentiation and cellular decision-making. Controlling the dispersion of multimodal probability distributions in biomolecular systems is critical for regulating stochastic behavior, robustness, and adaptability. However, modifying system parameters to adjust dispersion often affects peak positions, potentially altering a desired phenotype or even fundamental behavior in a genetic pathway. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that enables independent control of dispersion while preserving peak positions and modality using the Chemical Fokker-Planck Equation (CFPE) and sharpness, a measure of probability concentration around individual peaks. By analyzing the steady-state solution of the CFPE, we derive explicit conditions under which peak sharpness can be tuned monotonically without changing peak positions or modality. We validate our approach through Monte Carlo simulations on a bimodal chemical system, demonstrating effective dispersion control while maintaining structural stability. This framework provides a systematic approach for designing biomolecular systems with tunable stochastic properties, contributing to advancements in synthetic biology and probabilistic cellular regulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Atoms: Enhancing Molecular Pretrained Representations with 3D Space Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10489v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular pretrained representations (MPR) has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing the challenge of limited supervised data in applications such as drug discovery and material design. While early MPR methods relied on 1D sequences and 2D graphs, recent advancements have incorporated 3D conformational information to capture rich atomic interactions. However, these prior models treat molecules merely as discrete atom sets, overlooking the space surrounding them. We argue from a physical perspective that only modeling these discrete points is insufficient. We first present a simple yet insightful observation: naively adding randomly sampled virtual points beyond atoms can surprisingly enhance MPR performance. In light of this, we propose a principled framework that incorporates the entire 3D space spanned by molecules. We implement the framework via a novel Transformer-based architecture, dubbed SpaceFormer, with three key components: (1) grid-based space discretization; (2) grid sampling/merging; and (3) efficient 3D positional encoding. Extensive experiments show that SpaceFormer significantly outperforms previous 3D MPR models across various downstream tasks with limited data, validating the benefit of leveraging the additional 3D space beyond atoms in MPR models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Potential Score Matching: Debiasing Molecular Structure Sampling with Potential Energy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14569v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D-MolT5: Leveraging Discrete Structural Information for Molecule-Text Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05797v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of molecular and natural language representations has emerged as a focal point in molecular science, with recent advancements in Language Models (LMs) demonstrating significant potential for comprehensive modeling of both domains. However, existing approaches face notable limitations, particularly in their neglect of three-dimensional (3D) information, which is crucial for understanding molecular structures and functions. While some efforts have been made to incorporate 3D molecular information into LMs using external structure encoding modules, significant difficulties remain, such as insufficient interaction across modalities in pre-training and challenges in modality alignment. To address the limitations, we propose \textbf{3D-MolT5}, a unified framework designed to model molecule in both sequence and 3D structure spaces. The key innovation of our approach lies in mapping fine-grained 3D substructure representations into a specialized 3D token vocabulary. This methodology facilitates the seamless integration of sequence and structure representations in a tokenized format, enabling 3D-MolT5 to encode molecular sequences, molecular structures, and text sequences within a unified architecture. Leveraging this tokenized input strategy, we build a foundation model that unifies the sequence and structure data formats. We then conduct joint pre-training with multi-task objectives to enhance the model's comprehension of these diverse modalities within a shared representation space. Thus, our approach significantly improves cross-modal interaction and alignment, addressing key challenges in previous work. Further instruction tuning demonstrated that our 3D-MolT5 has strong generalization ability and surpasses existing methods with superior performance in multiple downstream tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/QizhiPei/3D-MolT5.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[TFG-Flow: Training-free Guidance in Multimodal Generative Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14216v3)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given an unconditional generative model and a predictor for a target property (e.g., a classifier), the goal of training-free guidance is to generate samples with desirable target properties without additional training. As a highly efficient technique for steering generative models toward flexible outcomes, training-free guidance has gained increasing attention in diffusion models. However, existing methods only handle data in continuous spaces, while many scientific applications involve both continuous and discrete data (referred to as multimodality). Another emerging trend is the growing use of the simple and general flow matching framework in building generative foundation models, where guided generation remains under-explored. To address this, we introduce TFG-Flow, a novel training-free guidance method for multimodal generative flow. TFG-Flow addresses the curse-of-dimensionality while maintaining the property of unbiased sampling in guiding discrete variables. We validate TFG-Flow on four molecular design tasks and show that TFG-Flow has great potential in drug design by generating molecules with desired properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Critical Phases for Disease Onset with Sparse Haematological Biomarkers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14561v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Routinely collected clinical blood tests are an emerging molecular data source for large-scale biomedical research but inherently feature irregular sampling and informative observation. Traditional approaches rely on imputation, which can distort learning signals and bias predictions while lacking biological interpretability. We propose a novel methodology using Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNAN) to model biomarker trajectories as time-weighted directed graphs, where nodes represent sampling events and edges encode the time delta between events. GNAN's additive structure enables the explicit decomposition of feature and temporal contributions, allowing the detection of critical disease-associated time points. Unlike conventional imputation-based approaches, our method preserves the temporal structure of sparse data without introducing artificial biases and provides inherently interpretable predictions by decomposing contributions from each biomarker and time interval. This makes our model clinically applicable, as well as allowing it to discover biologically meaningful disease signatures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstructing Cell Lineage Trees from Phenotypic Features with Metric Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13925v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How a single fertilized cell gives rise to a complex array of specialized cell types in development is a central question in biology. The cells grow, divide, and acquire differentiated characteristics through poorly understood molecular processes. A key approach to studying developmental processes is to infer the tree graph of cell lineage division and differentiation histories, providing an analytical framework for dissecting individual cells' molecular decisions during replication and differentiation. Although genetically engineered lineage-tracing methods have advanced the field, they are either infeasible or ethically constrained in many organisms. In contrast, modern single-cell technologies can measure high-content molecular profiles (e.g., transcriptomes) in a wide range of biological systems. Here, we introduce CellTreeQM, a novel deep learning method based on transformer architectures that learns an embedding space with geometric properties optimized for tree-graph inference. By formulating lineage reconstruction as a tree-metric learning problem, we have systematically explored supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised training settings and present a Lineage Reconstruction Benchmark to facilitate comprehensive evaluation of our learning method. We benchmarked the method on (1) synthetic data modeled via Brownian motion with independent noise and spurious signals and (2) lineage-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Experimental results show that CellTreeQM recovers lineage structures with minimal supervision and limited data, offering a scalable framework for uncovering cell lineage relationships in challenging animal models. To our knowledge, this is the first method to cast cell lineage inference explicitly as a metric learning task, paving the way for future computational models aimed at uncovering the molecular dynamics of cell lineage.</p></details> |  |

However, HJR suffers from the curse of dimensionality, with computation times growing exponentially in the dimension of the system state. Many autonomous and controlled systems involve dynamics that evolve on multiple timescales, and for these systems, singular perturbation methods can be used for model reduction. However, such methods are more challenging to apply in HJR due to the presence of an underlying differential game. In this work, we leverage prior work on singularly perturbed differential games to identify a class of systems which can be readily reduced, and we relate these results to the quantities of interest in HJR. We demonstrate the utility of our results on two examples involving biological systems, where dynamics fitting the identified class are frequently encountered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second version (note that title changed from previous version)</p></details> |

While deep graph models have demonstrated success in modeling complex biological systems, existing approaches often fail to distinguish between positive and negative interactions, limiting their utility for precise pharmacological predictions. In this study, we propose a novel deep graph model, \textbf{RGCNTD} (Relational Graph Convolutional Network with Tensor Decomposition), designed to predict both polar (e.g., activation, inhibition) and non-polar (e.g., binding, affect) chemical-gene interactions. Our model integrates graph convolutional networks with tensor decomposition to enhance feature representation and incorporates a conflict-aware sampling strategy to resolve polarity ambiguities. We introduce new evaluation metrics, \textit{AUC\textsubscript{polarity}} and \textit{CP@500}, to assess the model's ability to differentiate interaction types. Experimental results demonstrate that \textbf{RGCNTD} outperforms baseline models, achieving superior classification accuracy and improved discrimination of polar edges. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of subgraph components on predictive performance, revealing that additional network structures do not always enhance accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of polarity-aware modeling in drug discovery and network pharmacology, providing a robust framework for predicting complex biological interactions.</p></details> |  |

The utilization of deep learning methodologies for image analysis has attracted considerable interest in recent years, with multiple investigations employing such techniques for image segmentation and analysis within the realm of battery research. However, the automated analysis of high-resolution microscopy images for detecting phases and components in composite materials is still an underexplored area. This work proposes a novel workflow for detecting components and phase segmentation from raw high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images using a trained U-Net segmentation model. The developed model can expedite the detection of components and phase segmentation, diminishing the temporal and cognitive demands associated with scrutinizing an extensive array of TEM images, thereby mitigating the potential for human errors. This approach presents a novel and efficient image analysis approach with broad applicability beyond the battery field and holds potential for application in other related domains characterized by phase and composition distribution, such as alloy production.</p></details> |  |

Despite their widespread occurrence, there remains a gap in modeling particle propagation through these complex structures from a molecular communication (MC) perspective. This paper introduces a generalized analytical framework for modeling diffusion-based molecular communication in multi-layered spherical environments. The framework is capable of supporting an arbitrary number of layers and flexible transmitter-receiver positioning. As an example, the detailed formulation is presented for the three-layer sphere, which is particularly relevant for different biological models such as tumor spheroids. The analytical results are validated using particle-based simulation (PBS) in scenarios that have short inter-layer distances. The findings reveal that the characteristics of each layer significantly impact molecule propagation throughout the entire structure, making their consideration crucial for designing targeted therapies and optimizing drug delivery systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; accepted to be presented in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Communication</p></details> |
| **[Parameter Invariance Analysis of Moment Equations Using Dulmage-Mendelsohn Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13336v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Living organisms maintain stable functioning amid environmental fluctuations through homeostasis, a mechanism that preserves a system's behavior despite changes in environmental conditions. To elucidate homeostasis in stochastic biochemical reactions, theoretical tools for assessing population-level invariance under parameter perturbations are crucial. In this paper, we propose a systematic method for identifying the stationary moments that remain invariant under parameter perturbations by leveraging the structural properties of the stationary moment equations. A key step in this development is addressing the underdetermined nature of moment equations, which has traditionally made it difficult to characterize how stationary moments depend on system parameters. To overcome this, we utilize the Dulmage-Mendelsohn (DM) decomposition of the coefficient matrix to extract welldetermined subequations and reveal their hierarchical structure. Leveraging this structure, we identify stationary moments whose partial derivatives with respect to parameters are structurally zero, facilitating the exploration of fundamental constraints that govern homeostatic behavior in stochastic biochemical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Cox model with graph-structured variable selection priors for multi-omics biomarker identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13078v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important goal in cancer research is the survival prognosis of a patient based on a minimal panel of genomic and molecular markers such as genes or proteins. Purely data-driven models without any biological knowledge can produce non-interpretable results. We propose a penalized semiparametric Bayesian Cox model with graph-structured selection priors for sparse identification of multi-omics features by making use of a biologically meaningful graph via a Markov random field (MRF) prior to capturing known relationships between multi-omics features. Since the fixed graph in the MRF prior is for the prior probability distribution, it is not a hard constraint to determine variable selection, so the proposed model can verify known information and has the potential to identify new and novel biomarkers for drawing new biological knowledge. Our simulation results show that the proposed Bayesian Cox model with graph-based prior knowledge results in more trustable and stable variable selection and non-inferior survival prediction, compared to methods modeling the covariates independently without any prior knowledge. The results also indicate that the performance of the proposed model is robust to a partially correct graph in the MRF prior, meaning that in a real setting where not all the true network information between covariates is known, the graph can still be useful. The proposed model is applied to the primary invasive breast cancer patients data in The Cancer Genome Atlas project.</p></details> |  |

The de facto state-of-the-art algorithms for this purpose, SHAKE, LINCS and P-LINCS, converge slowly, impeding high-accuracy calculations and limiting the realism of simulations. Furthermore, LINCS and P-LINCS cannot handle general angular constraints, which restricts increasing the time step. In this paper, we introduce ILVES, a set of parallel algorithms that converge so rapidly that it is now practical to solve bond length and associated angular constraint equations as accurately as the hardware will allow. We have integrated our work into Gromacs and our analysis demonstrates that, in most cases, our software is superior to the state-of-the-art. We anticipate that ILVES will allow for an increase in the time step, thus accelerating contemporary calculations by a factor of at least 2. This will allow the scientific community to increase the range of phenomena that can therefore be simulated.</p></details> |  |

Our approach is based on an entropic matching framework that can be embedded into the well-known expectation propagation algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by providing closed-form results for a simple family of approximate distributions and apply it to the general class of chemical reaction networks, which are a crucial tool for modeling in systems biology. Moreover, we derive closed-form expressions for point estimation of the underlying parameters using an approximate expectation maximization procedure. We evaluate our method across various chemical reaction networks and compare it to multiple baseline approaches, demonstrating superior performance in approximating the mean of the posterior process. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our method and potential avenues for future improvement, highlighting its promising direction for addressing complex continuous-time Bayesian inference problems.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |
| **[A Reinforcement Learning-Driven Transformer GAN for Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12796v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating molecules with desired chemical properties presents a critical challenge in fields such as chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have significantly contributed to data-driven molecular generation. However, challenges persist due to the inherent sensitivity of simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) representations and the difficulties in applying generative adversarial networks (GANs) to discrete data. This study introduces RL-MolGAN, a novel Transformer-based discrete GAN framework designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional Transformer architectures, RL-MolGAN utilizes a first-decoder-then-encoder structure, facilitating the generation of drug-like molecules from both $de~novo$ and scaffold-based designs. In addition, RL-MolGAN integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) techniques to enhance the stability of GAN training and optimize the chemical properties of the generated molecules. To further improve the model's performance, RL-MolWGAN, an extension of RL-MolGAN, incorporates Wasserstein distance and mini-batch discrimination, which together enhance the stability of the GAN. Experimental results on two widely used molecular datasets, QM9 and ZINC, validate the effectiveness of our models in generating high-quality molecular structures with diverse and desirable chemical properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Cell Sorting with Scalable In Situ FPGA-Accelerated Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12622v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise cell classification is essential in biomedical diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring, particularly for identifying diverse cell types involved in various diseases. Traditional cell classification methods such as flow cytometry depend on molecular labeling which is often costly, time-intensive, and can alter cell integrity. To overcome these limitations, we present a label-free machine learning framework for cell classification, designed for real-time sorting applications using bright-field microscopy images. This approach leverages a teacher-student model architecture enhanced by knowledge distillation, achieving high efficiency and scalability across different cell types. Demonstrated through a use case of classifying lymphocyte subsets, our framework accurately classifies T4, T8, and B cell types with a dataset of 80,000 preprocessed images, accessible via an open-source Python package for easy adaptation. Our teacher model attained 98\% accuracy in differentiating T4 cells from B cells and 93\% accuracy in zero-shot classification between T8 and B cells. Remarkably, our student model operates with only 0.02\% of the teacher model's parameters, enabling field-programmable gate array (FPGA) deployment. Our FPGA-accelerated student model achieves an ultra-low inference latency of just 14.5~$\mu$s and a complete cell detection-to-sorting trigger time of 24.7~$\mu$s, delivering 12x and 40x improvements over the previous state-of-the-art real-time cell analysis algorithm in inference and total latency, respectively, while preserving accuracy comparable to the teacher model. This framework provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for lymphocyte classification, as well as a new SOTA real-time cell sorting implementation for rapid identification of subsets using in situ deep learning on off-the-shelf computing hardware.</p></details> |  |

Designed to support AI-driven drug design and discovery, M$^{3}$-20M is 71 times more in the number of molecules than the largest existing dataset, providing an unprecedented scale that can highly benefit the training or fine-tuning of models, including large language models for drug design and discovery tasks. This dataset integrates one-dimensional SMILES, two-dimensional molecular graphs, three-dimensional molecular structures, physicochemical properties, and textual descriptions collected through web crawling and generated using GPT-3.5, offering a comprehensive view of each molecule. To demonstrate the power of M$^{3}$-20M in drug design and discovery, we conduct extensive experiments on two key tasks: molecule generation and molecular property prediction, using large language models including GLM4, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama3-8b. Our experimental results show that M$^{3}$-20M can significantly boost model performance in both tasks. Specifically, it enables the models to generate more diverse and valid molecular structures and achieve higher property prediction accuracy than existing single-modal datasets, which validates the value and potential of M$^{3}$-20M in supporting AI-driven drug design and discovery.

| **[MDiff-FMT: Morphology-aware Diffusion Model for Fluorescence Molecular Tomography with Small-scale Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06757v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) is a sensitive optical imaging technology widely used in biomedical research. However, the ill-posedness of the inverse problem poses a huge challenge to FMT reconstruction. Although end-to-end deep learning algorithms have been widely used to address this critical issue, they still suffer from high data dependency and poor morphological restoration. In this paper, we report for the first time a morphology-aware diffusion model, MDiff-FMT, based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to achieve high-fidelity morphological reconstruction for FMT. First, we use the noise addition of DDPM to simulate the process of the gradual degradation of morphological features, and achieve fine-grained reconstruction of morphological features through a stepwise probabilistic sampling mechanism, avoiding problems such as loss of structure details that may occur in end-to-end deep learning methods. Additionally, we introduce the conditional fluorescence image as structural prior information to sample a high-fidelity reconstructed image from the noisy images. Numerous numerical and real phantom experimental results show that the proposed MDiff-FMT achieves SOTA results in morphological reconstruction of FMT without relying on large-scale datasets.</p></details> |  |

The ability to predict 1p19q status is critical for treatment planning and patient follow-up. This study aims to utilize a specially MRI-based convolutional neural network for brain cancer detection. Although public networks such as RestNet and AlexNet can effectively diagnose brain cancers using transfer learning, the model includes quite a few weights that have nothing to do with medical images. As a result, the diagnostic results are unreliable by the transfer learning model. To deal with the problem of trustworthiness, we create the model from the ground up, rather than depending on a pre-trained model. To enable flexibility, we combined convolution stacking with a dropout and full connect operation, it improved performance by reducing overfitting. During model training, we also supplement the given dataset and inject Gaussian noise. We use three--fold cross-validation to train the best selection model. Comparing InceptionV3, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 fine-tuned with pre-trained models, our model produces better results. On an validation set of 125 codeletion vs. 31 not codeletion images, the proposed network achieves 96.37\% percent F1-score, 97.46\% percent precision, and 96.34\% percent recall when classifying 1p/19q codeletion and not codeletion images.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICAI'...</summary><p>ICAI'22 - The 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, The 2022 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, & Applied Computing (CSCE'22), Las Vegas, USA.

| **[Probabilistic Graph Circuits: Deep Generative Models for Tractable Probabilistic Inference over Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12162v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models (DGMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in capturing complex probability distributions over graphs. Although their excellent performance is attributed to powerful and scalable deep neural networks, it is, at the same time, exactly the presence of these highly non-linear transformations that makes DGMs intractable. Indeed, despite representing probability distributions, intractable DGMs deny probabilistic foundations by their inability to answer even the most basic inference queries without approximations or design choices specific to a very narrow range of queries. To address this limitation, we propose probabilistic graph circuits (PGCs), a framework of tractable DGMs that provide exact and efficient probabilistic inference over (arbitrary parts of) graphs. Nonetheless, achieving both exactness and efficiency is challenging in the permutation-invariant setting of graphs. We design PGCs that are inherently invariant and satisfy these two requirements, yet at the cost of low expressive power. Therefore, we investigate two alternative strategies to achieve the invariance: the first sacrifices the efficiency, and the second sacrifices the exactness. We demonstrate that ignoring the permutation invariance can have severe consequences in anomaly detection, and that the latter approach is competitive with, and sometimes better than, existing intractable DGMs in the context of molecular graph generation.</p></details> |  |

By constructing equivariant local frames with learnable geometric transitions, AlphaNet encodes atomic environments with enhanced representational capacity, achieving state of the art accuracy in energy and force predictions. Extensive benchmarks spanning defected graphene, formate decomposition, inorganic bulks, and large-scale datasets (OC2M and Matbench Discovery) demonstrate its superior performance over existing neural network interatomic potentials while ensuring scalability across diverse system sizes. The synergy of accuracy, efficiency, and transferability positions AlphaNet as a transformative tool for simulating multiscale phenomena, from catalyst dynamics to energy storage interfaces, with direct implications for accelerating the discovery of functional materials and complex molecular systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

As the shift toward personalized care intensifies, there is a growing need for an individual's virtual replica that delivers the right treatment at the optimal time and in the most effective manner. The emerging concept of a Human Digital Twin (HDT) holds the potential to revolutionize the traditional healthcare system much like digital twins have transformed manufacturing and aviation. An HDT mirrors the physical entity of a human body through a dynamic virtual model that continuously reflects changes in molecular, physiological, emotional, and lifestyle factors. This digital representation not only supports remote monitoring, diagnosis, and prescription but also facilitates surgery, rehabilitation, and overall personalized care, thereby relieving pressure on conventional healthcare frameworks. Despite its promising advantages, there are considerable research challenges to overcome as HDT technology evolves. In this study, I will initially delineate the distinctions between traditional digital twins and HDTs, followed by an exploration of the networking architecture integral to their operation--from data acquisition and communication to computation, management, and decision-making--thereby offering insights into how these innovations may reshape the modern healthcare industry.</p></details> |  |

In ligand-based drug design, bioisosteric analogues of known bioactive hits are often identified by virtually screening chemical libraries with shape, electrostatic, and pharmacophore similarity scoring functions. We instead hypothesize that a generative model which learns the joint distribution over 3D molecular structures and their interaction profiles may facilitate 3D interaction-aware chemical design. We specifically design ShEPhERD, an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model which jointly diffuses/denoises 3D molecular graphs and representations of their shapes, electrostatic potential surfaces, and (directional) pharmacophores to/from Gaussian noise. Inspired by traditional ligand discovery, we compose 3D similarity scoring functions to assess ShEPhERD's ability to conditionally generate novel molecules with desired interaction profiles. We demonstrate ShEPhERD's potential for impact via exemplary drug design tasks including natural product ligand hopping, protein-blind bioactive hit diversification, and bioisosteric fragment merging.</p></details> |  |

In the past decade, machine learning methods have shown highly promising results, also in changepoint detection and segmentation tasks. Here, we introduce a novel iterative method to identify the changepoints in a molecular trajectory, i.e., frames, where the diffusive behavior of a particle changes. A trajectory in our case follows a fractional Brownian motion and we estimate the diffusive properties of the trajectories. The proposed BI-ADD combines unsupervised and supervised learning methods to detect the changepoints. Our approach can be used for the analysis of molecular trajectories at the individual level and also be extended to multiple particle tracking, which is an important challenge in fundamental biology. We validated BI-ADD in various scenarios within the framework of the AnDi2 Challenge 2024 dedicated to single particle tracking. Our method is implemented in Python and is publicly available for research purposes.</p></details> |  |

These models can accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation by several orders of magnitude while maintaining \textit{ab initio} accuracy, making them a promising new paradigm in material simulations. One notable example is Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network (CHGNet), pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic moments from the MPtrj dataset, representing a state-of-the-art GNN-UIP model for charge-informed MD simulations. However, training the CHGNet model is time-consuming(8.3 days on one A100 GPU) for three reasons: (i) requiring multi-layer propagation to reach more distant atom information, (ii) requiring second-order derivatives calculation to finish weights updating and (iii) the implementation of reference CHGNet does not fully leverage the computational capabilities. This paper introduces FastCHGNet, an optimized CHGNet, with three contributions: Firstly, we design innovative Force/Stress Readout modules to decompose Force/Stress prediction. Secondly, we adopt massive optimizations such as kernel fusion, redundancy bypass, etc, to exploit GPU computation power sufficiently. Finally, we extend CHGNet to support multiple GPUs and propose a load-balancing technique to enhance GPU utilization. Numerical results show that FastCHGNet reduces memory footprint by a factor of 3.59. The final training time of FastCHGNet can be decreased to \textbf{1.53 hours} on 32 GPUs without sacrificing model accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While chemical Language Models (cLMs) have made strides in learning molecular properties, most fail to incorporate target-specific insights, restricting their ability to drive de-novo ligand generation. Chem42, a cutting-edge family of generative chemical Language Models, is designed to bridge this gap. By integrating atomic-level interactions with multimodal inputs from Prot42, a complementary protein Language Model, Chem42 achieves a sophisticated cross-modal representation of molecular structures, interactions, and binding patterns. This innovative framework enables the creation of structurally valid, synthetically accessible ligands with enhanced target specificity. Evaluations across diverse protein targets confirm that Chem42 surpasses existing approaches in chemical validity, target-aware design, and predicted binding affinity. By reducing the search space of viable drug candidates, Chem42 could accelerate the drug discovery pipeline, offering a powerful generative AI tool for precision medicine. Our Chem42 models set a new benchmark in molecule property prediction, conditional molecule generation, and target-aware ligand design. The models are publicly available at huggingface.co/inceptionai.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unified Latent Space for 3D Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15567v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Potential Score Matching: Debiasing Molecular Structure Sampling with Potential Energy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14569v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Reinforcement Learning-Driven Transformer GAN for Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12796v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating molecules with desired chemical properties presents a critical challenge in fields such as chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have significantly contributed to data-driven molecular generation. However, challenges persist due to the inherent sensitivity of simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) representations and the difficulties in applying generative adversarial networks (GANs) to discrete data. This study introduces RL-MolGAN, a novel Transformer-based discrete GAN framework designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional Transformer architectures, RL-MolGAN utilizes a first-decoder-then-encoder structure, facilitating the generation of drug-like molecules from both $de~novo$ and scaffold-based designs. In addition, RL-MolGAN integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) techniques to enhance the stability of GAN training and optimize the chemical properties of the generated molecules. To further improve the model's performance, RL-MolWGAN, an extension of RL-MolGAN, incorporates Wasserstein distance and mini-batch discrimination, which together enhance the stability of the GAN. Experimental results on two widely used molecular datasets, QM9 and ZINC, validate the effectiveness of our models in generating high-quality molecular structures with diverse and desirable chemical properties.</p></details> |  |

Designed to support AI-driven drug design and discovery, M$^{3}$-20M is 71 times more in the number of molecules than the largest existing dataset, providing an unprecedented scale that can highly benefit the training or fine-tuning of models, including large language models for drug design and discovery tasks. This dataset integrates one-dimensional SMILES, two-dimensional molecular graphs, three-dimensional molecular structures, physicochemical properties, and textual descriptions collected through web crawling and generated using GPT-3.5, offering a comprehensive view of each molecule. To demonstrate the power of M$^{3}$-20M in drug design and discovery, we conduct extensive experiments on two key tasks: molecule generation and molecular property prediction, using large language models including GLM4, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama3-8b. Our experimental results show that M$^{3}$-20M can significantly boost model performance in both tasks. Specifically, it enables the models to generate more diverse and valid molecular structures and achieve higher property prediction accuracy than existing single-modal datasets, which validates the value and potential of M$^{3}$-20M in supporting AI-driven drug design and discovery.

| **[Probabilistic Graph Circuits: Deep Generative Models for Tractable Probabilistic Inference over Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12162v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models (DGMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in capturing complex probability distributions over graphs. Although their excellent performance is attributed to powerful and scalable deep neural networks, it is, at the same time, exactly the presence of these highly non-linear transformations that makes DGMs intractable. Indeed, despite representing probability distributions, intractable DGMs deny probabilistic foundations by their inability to answer even the most basic inference queries without approximations or design choices specific to a very narrow range of queries. To address this limitation, we propose probabilistic graph circuits (PGCs), a framework of tractable DGMs that provide exact and efficient probabilistic inference over (arbitrary parts of) graphs. Nonetheless, achieving both exactness and efficiency is challenging in the permutation-invariant setting of graphs. We design PGCs that are inherently invariant and satisfy these two requirements, yet at the cost of low expressive power. Therefore, we investigate two alternative strategies to achieve the invariance: the first sacrifices the efficiency, and the second sacrifices the exactness. We demonstrate that ignoring the permutation invariance can have severe consequences in anomaly detection, and that the latter approach is competitive with, and sometimes better than, existing intractable DGMs in the context of molecular graph generation.</p></details> |  |

While these pesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning applications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or regression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular structures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Pesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders, designed to create pesticide candidates with optimized properties for the first time. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an initial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure representation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates toxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple toxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity to generate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Notably, Pesti-Gen achieves approximately 68\% structural validity in generating new molecular structures, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in producing optimized and feasible pesticide candidates, thereby providing a new way for safer and more sustainable pest management solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the RECOMB 2025 Poster Track</p></details> |

This success is largely attributed to the effectiveness of molecular tokenization strategies. In protein science, the amino acid sequence serves as the sole tokenizer for LLMs. However, many fundamental challenges in protein science are inherently structure-dependent. The absence of structure-aware tokens significantly limits the capabilities of LLMs for comprehensive biomolecular comprehension and multimodal generation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, ProtTeX, which tokenizes the protein sequences, structures, and textual information into a unified discrete space. This innovative approach enables joint training of the LLM exclusively through the Next-Token Prediction paradigm, facilitating multimodal protein reasoning and generation. ProtTeX enables general LLMs to perceive and process protein structures through sequential text input, leverage structural information as intermediate reasoning components, and generate or manipulate structures via sequential text output. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in protein function prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art domain expert model with a twofold increase in accuracy. Our framework enables high-quality conformational generation and customizable protein design. For the first time, we demonstrate that by adopting the standard training and inference pipelines from the LLM domain, ProtTeX empowers decoder-only LLMs to effectively address diverse spectrum of protein-related tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Chemistry-Inspired Diffusion with Non-Differentiable Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06502v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in the conditional generation of novel molecules. These models can be guided in two ways: (i) explicitly, through additional features representing the condition, or (ii) implicitly, using a property predictor. However, training property predictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled data and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a novel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled datasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a non-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of relying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form of estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a conditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this results in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular structures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly reduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used for stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit guidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular properties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular optimization tasks beyond stability optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Concept-Driven Deep Learning for Enhanced Protein-Specific Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08160v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, deep learning techniques have made significant strides in molecular generation for specific targets, driving advancements in drug discovery. However, existing molecular generation methods present significant limitations: those operating at the atomic level often lack synthetic feasibility, drug-likeness, and interpretability, while fragment-based approaches frequently overlook comprehensive factors that influence protein-molecule interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel fragment-based molecular generation framework tailored for specific proteins. Our method begins by constructing a protein subpocket and molecular arm concept-based neural network, which systematically integrates interaction force information and geometric complementarity to sample molecular arms for specific protein subpockets. Subsequently, we introduce a diffusion model to generate molecular backbones that connect these arms, ensuring structural integrity and chemical diversity. Our approach significantly improves synthetic feasibility and binding affinity, with a 4% increase in drug-likeness and a 6% improvement in synthetic feasibility. Furthermore, by integrating explicit interaction data through a concept-based model, our framework enhances interpretability, offering valuable insights into the molecular design process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Molecular Graphs and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03135v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional generalization capabilities, their ability to process graph data, such as molecular structures, remains limited. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Graph2Token, an efficient solution that aligns graph tokens to LLM tokens. The key idea is to represent a graph token with the LLM token vocabulary, without fine-tuning the LLM backbone. To achieve this goal, we first construct a molecule-text paired dataset from multisources, including CHEBI and HMDB, to train a graph structure encoder, which reduces the distance between graphs and texts representations in the feature space. Then, we propose a novel alignment strategy that associates a graph token with LLM tokens. To further unleash the potential of LLMs, we collect molecular IUPAC name identifiers, which are incorporated into the LLM prompts. By aligning molecular graphs as special tokens, we can activate LLM generalization ability to molecular few-shot learning. Extensive experiments on molecular classification and regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Graph2Token.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 camera ready version</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of manual annotation for biochemical properties, the performance for molecule generation tasks is still limited, especially for tasks involving multi-properties constraints. In this work, we present a two-step framework PEIT (Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning) to improve LLMs for molecular-related tasks. In the first step, we use textual descriptions, SMILES, and biochemical properties as multimodal inputs to pre-train a model called PEIT-GEN, by aligning multi-modal representations to synthesize instruction data. In the second step, we fine-tune existing open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the resulting PEIT-LLM can handle molecule captioning, text-based molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and our newly proposed multi-constraint molecule generation tasks. Experimental results show that our pre-trained PEIT-GEN outperforms MolT5 and BioT5 in molecule captioning, demonstrating modalities align well between textual descriptions, structures, and biochemical properties. Furthermore, PEIT-LLM shows promising improvements in multi-task molecule generation, proving the scalability of the PEIT framework for various molecular tasks. We release the code, constructed instruction data, and model checkpoints in https://github.com/chenlong164/PEIT.</p></details> | 9 |

Previous works in this framework often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on a subset of ZINC dataset, and by employing robust evaluation metrics we show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods for a wide range of drug design tasks.</p></details> |  |

While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an \emph{order-policy}, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the exact log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation. On the challenging domain of molecular graph generation, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k benchmarks, evaluated using the Fr\'{e}chet ChemNet Distance (FCD).</p></details> |  |

We introduce Mol-CADiff, a novel diffusion-based framework that uses causal attention mechanisms for text-conditional molecular generation. Our approach explicitly models the causal relationship between textual prompts and molecular structures, overcoming key limitations in existing methods. We enhance dependency modeling both within and across modalities, enabling precise control over the generation process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Mol-CADiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating diverse, novel, and chemically valid molecules, with better alignment to specified properties, enabling more intuitive language-driven molecular design.</p></details> |  |

However, the prediction and interpretation of these sequences remain challenging due to the intricate nature of genetic material. Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for biological sequence analysis. Recent developments in genomic language models have underscored the potential of LLMs in deciphering DNA sequences. Nonetheless, existing models often face limitations in robustness and application scope, primarily due to constraints in model structure and training data scale. To address these limitations, we present GENERator, a generative genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 98k base pairs (bp) and 1.2B parameters. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386B bp of eukaryotic DNA, the GENERator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both established and newly proposed benchmarks. The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology, accurately generating protein-coding sequences that translate into proteins structurally analogous to known families. It also shows significant promise in sequence optimization, particularly through the prompt-responsive generation of enhancer sequences with specific activity profiles. These capabilities position the GENERator as a pivotal tool for genomic research and biotechnological advancement, enhancing our ability to interpret and predict complex biological systems and enabling precise genomic interventions.

This work introduces a Python-based algorithm that automates the generation of reaction templates for the LAMMPS REACTION package, leveraging graph-theoretical principles and sub-graph isomorphism techniques. By representing molecular systems as mathematical graphs, the method enables automated identification of conserved molecular domains, reaction sites, and atom mappings, significantly reducing manual effort. The algorithm was validated on three case studies: poly-addition, poly-condensation, and chain polymerization, demonstrating its ability to map conserved regions, identify reaction-initiating atoms, and resolve challenges such as symmetric reactants and indistinguishable atoms. Additionally, the generated templates were optimized for computational efficiency by retaining only essential reactive domains, ensuring scalability and consistency in high-throughput workflows for computational chemistry, materials science, and machine learning applications. Future work will focus on extending the method to mixed organic-inorganic systems, incorporating adaptive scoring mechanisms, and integrating quantum mechanical calculations to enhance its applicability.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

The proposed process aligns well with the noise sensitivity characteristic of molecular structures and uniformly distributes reconstruction effort across the generative process, thus enhancing learning efficiency and efficacy. Consequently, SLDM achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D molecule generation benchmarks, delivering a 100-fold improvement in sampling efficiency.

In this study, we have developed P2DFlow, a generative model based on SE(3) flow matching, to predict the structural ensembles of proteins. We specifically designed a valuable prior for the flow process and enhanced the model's ability to distinguish each intermediate state by incorporating an additional dimension to describe the ensemble data, which can reflect the physical laws governing the distribution of ensembles, so that the prior knowledge can effectively guide the generation process. When trained and evaluated on the MD datasets of ATLAS, P2DFlow outperforms other baseline models on extensive experiments, successfully capturing the observable dynamic fluctuations as evidenced in crystal structure and MD simulations. As a potential proxy agent for protein molecular simulation, the high-quality ensembles generated by P2DFlow could significantly aid in understanding protein functions across various scenarios.

Some gradient-free guidance methods have been developed, but they often struggle to achieve optimal inference-time alignment. In this work, we newly frame inference-time alignment in diffusion as a search problem and propose Dynamic Search for Diffusion (DSearch), which subsamples from denoising processes and approximates intermediate node rewards. It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in atom- and motif-wise deep learning models for 3D molecular generation, current methods often struggle with validity and reliability. To address these issues, we develop the Atom-Motif Consistency Diffusion Model (AMDiff), utilizing a joint-training paradigm for multi-view learning. This model features a hierarchical diffusion architecture that integrates both atom- and motif-level views of molecules, allowing for comprehensive exploration of complementary information. By leveraging classifier-free guidance and incorporating binding site features as conditional inputs, AMDiff ensures robust molecule generation across diverse targets. Compared to existing approaches, AMDiff exhibits superior validity and novelty in generating molecules tailored to fit various protein pockets. Case studies targeting protein kinases, including Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) and Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), demonstrate the model's capability in structure-based de novo drug design.

Existing methods fall into PC-Free and PC-Aware categories based on their use of 3D point clouds (PC). PC-Free models prioritize diversity but suffer from lower validity due to overlooking PC constraints, while PC-Aware models ensure higher validity but restrict diversity by enforcing strict PC constraints. To overcome these trade-offs without additional training, we propose HybridLinker, a framework that enhances PC-Aware inference by providing diverse bonding topologies from a pretrained PC-Free model as guidance. At its core, we propose LinkerDPS, the first diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) method operating across PC-Free and PC-Aware spaces, bridging molecular topology with 3D point clouds via an energy-inspired function. By transferring the diverse sampling distribution of PC-Free models into the PC-Aware distribution, HybridLinker significantly and consistently surpasses baselines, improving both validity and diversity in foundational molecular design and applied property optimization tasks, establishing a new DPS framework in the molecular and graph domains beyond imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Auto-encoding Molecules: Graph-Matching Capabilities Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00426v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoencoders are effective deep learning models that can function as generative models and learn latent representations for downstream tasks. The use of graph autoencoders - with both encoder and decoder implemented as message passing networks - is intriguing due to their ability to generate permutation-invariant graph representations. However, this approach faces difficulties because decoding a graph structure from a single vector is challenging, and comparing input and output graphs requires an effective permutation-invariant similarity measure. As a result, many studies rely on approximate methods. In this work, we explore the effect of graph matching precision on the training behavior and generation capabilities of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we propose a transformer-based message passing graph decoder as an alternative to a graph neural network decoder, that is more robust and expressive by leveraging global attention mechanisms. (2) We show that the precision of graph matching has significant impact on training behavior and is essential for effective de novo (molecular) graph generation.

Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training of the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, the offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in the real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively.

We further introduce an unconditional 3D molecular generation model, SemlaFlow, which is trained using equivariant flow matching to generate a joint distribution over atom types, coordinates, bond types and formal charges. Our model produces state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with as few as 20 sampling steps, corresponding to a two order-of-magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight limitations of current evaluation methods for 3D generation and propose new benchmark metrics for unconditional molecular generators. Finally, using these new metrics, we compare our model's ability to generate high quality samples against current approaches and further demonstrate SemlaFlow's strong performance.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |

Inspired by recent studies, which demonstrate that diffusion model, a prominent generative approach, can learn meaningful data representations that enhance predictive tasks, we explore the potential for developing a unified generative model in the molecular domain that effectively addresses both molecular generation and property prediction tasks. However, the integration of these tasks is challenging due to inherent inconsistencies, making simple multi-task learning ineffective. To address this, we propose UniGEM, the first unified model to successfully integrate molecular generation and property prediction, delivering superior performance in both tasks. Our key innovation lies in a novel two-phase generative process, where predictive tasks are activated in the later stages, after the molecular scaffold is formed. We further enhance task balance through innovative training strategies. Rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in both tasks. The principles behind UniGEM hold promise for broader applications, including natural language processing and computer vision.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

However, the prevailing practice of representing chemical compounds in the SMILES format -- used by most datasets and many language models -- presents notable limitations as a training data format. In contrast, chemical fingerprints offer a more physically informed representation of compounds, thereby enhancing their suitability for model training. This study aims to develop a language model that is specifically trained on fingerprints. Furthermore, we introduce a bimodal architecture that integrates this language model with a graph model. Our proposed methodology synthesizes these approaches, utilizing RoBERTa as the language model and employing Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graphormer as graph models. This integration results in a significant improvement in predictive performance compared to conventional strategies for tasks such as Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) and the prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, among others.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, retrieval-augmented generation has become a principled approach commonly used with language models. However, the optimal integration of retrieval augmentation into molecular machine learning remains unclear. Graph neural networks stand to benefit from clever matching to understand the structural alignment of retrieved molecules to a query molecule. Neural graph matching offers a compelling solution by explicitly modeling node and edge affinities between two structural graphs while employing a noise-robust, end-to-end neural network to learn affinity metrics. We apply this approach to mass spectrum simulation and introduce MARASON, a novel model that incorporates neural graph matching to enhance a fragmentation-based neural network. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our design, with MARASON achieving 28% top-1 accuracy, a substantial improvement over the non-retrieval state-of-the-art accuracy of 19%. Moreover, MARASON outperforms both naive retrieval-augmented generation methods and traditional graph matching approaches.</p></details> |  |

The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.</p></details> |  |

Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in interpreting molecular structures, their instruction datasets are limited to the specific knowledge from task-oriented datasets and do not fully cover the fundamental characteristics of molecules, hindering their abilities as general-purpose molecular assistants. To address this issue, we propose Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules via multi-modal instruction tuning. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental features of molecules, incorporating essential knowledge from molecular structures. In addition, to improve understanding of molecular features, we introduce a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of different molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and generating relevant responses to users' queries with detailed explanations, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.

Traditional generative models often struggle with limited training data, particularly in drug discovery, where molecular datasets for specific therapeutic targets, such as nucleic acids binders and central nervous system (CNS) drugs, are scarce. ADSeqGAN addresses this challenge by integrating an auxiliary random forest classifier as an additional discriminator into the GAN framework, significantly improves molecular generation quality and class specificity. Our method incorporates pretrained generator and Wasserstein distance to enhance training stability and diversity. We evaluate ADSeqGAN on a dataset comprising nucleic acid-targeting and protein-targeting small molecules, demonstrating its superior ability to generate nucleic acid binders compared to baseline models such as SeqGAN, ORGAN, and MolGPT. Through an oversampling strategy, ADSeqGAN also significantly improves CNS drug generation, achieving a higher yield than traditional de novo models. Critical assessments, including docking simulations and molecular property analysis, confirm that ADSeqGAN-generated molecules exhibit strong binding affinities, enhanced chemical diversity, and improved synthetic feasibility. Overall, ADSeqGAN presents a novel framework for generative molecular design in data-scarce scenarios, offering potential applications in computational drug discovery. We have demonstrated the successful applications of ADSeqGAN in generating synthetic nucleic acid-targeting and CNS drugs in this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating $π$-Functional Molecules Using STGG+ with Active Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14842v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating novel molecules with out-of-distribution properties is a major challenge in molecular discovery. While supervised learning methods generate high-quality molecules similar to those in a dataset, they struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution properties. Reinforcement learning can explore new chemical spaces but often conducts 'reward-hacking' and generates non-synthesizable molecules. In this work, we address this problem by integrating a state-of-the-art supervised learning method, STGG+, in an active learning loop. Our approach iteratively generates, evaluates, and fine-tunes STGG+ to continuously expand its knowledge. We denote this approach STGG+AL. We apply STGG+AL to the design of organic $\pi$-functional materials, specifically two challenging tasks: 1) generating highly absorptive molecules characterized by high oscillator strength and 2) designing absorptive molecules with reasonable oscillator strength in the near-infrared (NIR) range. The generated molecules are validated and rationalized in-silico with time-dependent density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that our method is highly effective in generating novel molecules with high oscillator strength, contrary to existing methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We open-source our active-learning code along with our Conjugated-xTB dataset containing 2.9 million $\pi$-conjugated molecules and the function for approximating the oscillator strength and absorption wavelength (based on sTDA-xTB).</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/STGG-AL</p></details> |

This approach reduces computational complexity while maintaining high chemical validity, enabling more efficient and scalable molecular generation. We benchmark FragFM against state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based models on standard molecular generation benchmarks and natural product datasets, demonstrating superior performance in validity, property control, and sampling efficiency. Notably, FragFM achieves over 99\% validity with significantly fewer sampling steps, improving scalability while preserving molecular diversity. These results highlight the potential of fragment-based generative modeling for large-scale, property-aware molecular design, paving the way for more efficient exploration of chemical space.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 figures, under review</p></details> |

Existing methods primarily focus on single-scale features, overlooking the hierarchical molecular structures that determine different molecular properties. To address these issues, we introduce Universal Matching Networks (UniMatch), a dual matching framework that integrates explicit hierarchical molecular matching with implicit task-level matching via meta-learning, bridging multi-level molecular representations and task-level generalization. Specifically, our approach explicitly captures structural features across multiple levels, such as atoms, substructures, and molecules, via hierarchical pooling and matching, facilitating precise molecular representation and comparison. Additionally, we employ a meta-learning strategy for implicit task-level matching, allowing the model to capture shared patterns across tasks and quickly adapt to new ones. This unified matching framework ensures effective molecular alignment while leveraging shared meta-knowledge for fast adaptation. Our experimental results demonstrate that UniMatch outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the MoleculeNet and FS-Mol benchmarks, achieving improvements of 2.87% in AUROC and 6.52% in delta AUPRC. UniMatch also shows excellent generalization ability on the Meta-MolNet benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as ICLR 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Diverse Molecules? Towards Alignment with Structural Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03138v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in molecular generation, which offers potential to accelerate drug discovery. However, the current LLMs overlook a critical requirement for drug discovery: proposing a diverse set of molecules. This diversity is essential for improving the chances of finding a viable drug, as it provides alternative molecules that may succeed where others fail in real-world validations. Nevertheless, the LLMs often output structurally similar molecules. While decoding schemes like diverse beam search may enhance textual diversity, this often does not align with molecular structural diversity. In response, we propose a new method for fine-tuning molecular generative LLMs to autoregressively generate a set of structurally diverse molecules, where each molecule is generated by conditioning on the previously generated molecules. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) supervised fine-tuning to adapt LLMs to autoregressively generate molecules in a sequence and (2) reinforcement learning to maximize structural diversity within the generated molecules. Our experiments show that the proposed approach enables LLMs to generate diverse molecules better than existing approaches for diverse sequence generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MING: A Functional Approach to Learning Molecular Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12522v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional molecule generation methods often rely on sequence- or graph-based representations, which can limit their expressive power or require complex permutation-equivariant architectures. This paper introduces a novel paradigm for learning molecule generative models based on functional representations. Specifically, we propose Molecular Implicit Neural Generation (MING), a diffusion-based model that learns molecular distributions in the function space. Unlike standard diffusion processes in the data space, MING employs a novel functional denoising probabilistic process, which jointly denoises information in both the function's input and output spaces by leveraging an expectation-maximization procedure for latent implicit neural representations of data. This approach enables a simple yet effective model design that accurately captures underlying function distributions. Experimental results on molecule-related datasets demonstrate MING's superior performance and ability to generate plausible molecular samples, surpassing state-of-the-art data-space methods while offering a more streamlined architecture and significantly faster generation times.

| **[Conformal Generative Modeling with Improved Sample Efficiency through Sequential Greedy Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01660v2)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models lack rigorous statistical guarantees for their outputs and are therefore unreliable in safety-critical applications. In this work, we propose Sequential Conformal Prediction for Generative Models (SCOPE-Gen), a sequential conformal prediction method producing prediction sets that satisfy a rigorous statistical guarantee called conformal admissibility control. This guarantee states that with high probability, the prediction sets contain at least one admissible (or valid) example. To this end, our method first samples an initial set of i.i.d. examples from a black box generative model. Then, this set is iteratively pruned via so-called greedy filters. As a consequence of the iterative generation procedure, admissibility of the final prediction set factorizes as a Markov chain. This factorization is crucial, because it allows to control each factor separately, using conformal prediction. In comparison to prior work, our method demonstrates a large reduction in the number of admissibility evaluations during calibration. This reduction is important in safety-critical applications, where these evaluations must be conducted manually by domain experts and are therefore costly and time consuming. We highlight the advantages of our method in terms of admissibility evaluations and cardinality of the prediction sets through experiments in natural language generation and molecular graph extension tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MassSpecGym: A benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23326v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery and identification of molecules in biological and environmental samples is crucial for advancing biomedical and chemical sciences. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the leading technique for high-throughput elucidation of molecular structures. However, decoding a molecular structure from its mass spectrum is exceptionally challenging, even when performed by human experts. As a result, the vast majority of acquired MS/MS spectra remain uninterpreted, thereby limiting our understanding of the underlying (bio)chemical processes. Despite decades of progress in machine learning applications for predicting molecular structures from MS/MS spectra, the development of new methods is severely hindered by the lack of standard datasets and evaluation protocols. To address this problem, we propose MassSpecGym -- the first comprehensive benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules from MS/MS data. Our benchmark comprises the largest publicly available collection of high-quality labeled MS/MS spectra and defines three MS/MS annotation challenges: de novo molecular structure generation, molecule retrieval, and spectrum simulation. It includes new evaluation metrics and a generalization-demanding data split, therefore standardizing the MS/MS annotation tasks and rendering the problem accessible to the broad machine learning community. MassSpecGym is publicly available at https://github.com/pluskal-lab/MassSpecGym.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmetry-Preserving Diffusion Models via Target Symmetrization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09890v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are powerful tools for capturing complex distributions, but modeling data with inherent symmetries, such as molecular structures, remains challenging. Equivariant denoisers are commonly used to address this, but they introduce architectural complexity and optimization challenges, including noisy gradients and convergence issues. We propose a novel approach that enforces equivariance through a symmetrized loss function, which applies a time-dependent weighted averaging operation over group actions to the model's prediction target. This ensures equivariance without explicit architectural constraints and reduces gradient variance, leading to more stable and efficient optimization. Our method uses Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the average, incurring minimal computational overhead. We provide theoretical guarantees of equivariance for the minimizer of our loss function and demonstrate its effectiveness on synthetic datasets and the molecular conformation generation task using the GEOM-QM9 dataset. Experiments show improved sample quality compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of our approach to enhance the scalability and practicality of equivariant diffusion models in generative tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffMS: Diffusion Generation of Molecules Conditioned on Mass Spectra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09571v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mass spectrometry plays a fundamental role in elucidating the structures of unknown molecules and subsequent scientific discoveries. One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional $\textit{de novo}$ generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on $\textit{de novo}$ molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size. DiffMS code is publicly available at https://github.com/coleygroup/DiffMS.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Diffusion Models for Molecules: A Survey of Methods and Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09511v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative tasks about molecules, including but not limited to molecule generation, are crucial for drug discovery and material design, and have consistently attracted significant attention. In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as an impressive class of deep generative models, sparking extensive research and leading to numerous studies on their application to molecular generative tasks. Despite the proliferation of related work, there remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this area. Particularly, due to the diversity of diffusion model formulations, molecular data modalities, and generative task types, the research landscape is challenging to navigate, hindering understanding and limiting the area's growth. To address this, this paper conducts a comprehensive survey of diffusion model-based molecular generative methods. We systematically review the research from the perspectives of methodological formulations, data modalities, and task types, offering a novel taxonomy. This survey aims to facilitate understanding and further flourishing development in this area.

| **[Enhancing Diffusion Models Efficiency by Disentangling Total-Variance and Signal-to-Noise Ratio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08598v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long sampling time of diffusion models remains a significant bottleneck, which can be mitigated by reducing the number of diffusion time steps. However, the quality of samples with fewer steps is highly dependent on the noise schedule, i.e., the specific manner in which noise is introduced and the signal is reduced at each step. Although prior work has improved upon the original variance-preserving and variance-exploding schedules, these approaches $\textit{passively}$ adjust the total variance, without direct control over it. In this work, we propose a novel total-variance/signal-to-noise-ratio disentangled (TV/SNR) framework, where TV and SNR can be controlled independently. Our approach reveals that different existing schedules, where the TV explodes exponentially, can be $\textit{improved}$ by setting a constant TV schedule while preserving the same SNR schedule. Furthermore, generalizing the SNR schedule of the optimal transport flow matching significantly improves the performance in molecular structure generation, achieving few step generation of stable molecules. A similar tendency is observed in image generation, where our approach with a uniform diffusion time grid performs comparably to the highly tailored EDM sampler.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Representation Condition Improves Equivariant Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03655v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in molecular generative models have demonstrated substantial potential in accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often face challenges in generating high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to enhance the performance of molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the molecule generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared to directly generating a molecule, the relatively easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second-stage generation to reach a high-quality molecule in a more goal-oriented and much faster way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as the base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation tasks on the widely-used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 31\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations over conditioning on individual property values as in previous approaches. Furthermore, we show that, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly accelerating the generation process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation of Molecules via Algebraic Data Types : Advancing Beyond SMILES & SELFIES](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13633v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel molecular representation through Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) - composite data structures formed through the combination of simpler types that obey algebraic laws. By explicitly considering how the datatype of a representation constrains the operations which may be performed, we ensure meaningful inference can be performed over generative models (programs with sample} and score operations). This stands in contrast to string-based representations where string-type operations may only indirectly correspond to chemical and physical molecular properties, and at worst produce nonsensical output. The ADT presented implements the Dietz representation for molecular constitution via multigraphs and bonding systems, and uses atomic coordinate data to represent 3D information and stereochemical features. This creates a general digital molecular representation which surpasses the limitations of the string-based representations and the 2D-graph based models on which they are based. In addition, we present novel support for quantum information through representation of shells, subshells, and orbitals, greatly expanding the representational scope beyond current approaches, for instance in Molecular Orbital theory. The framework's capabilities are demonstrated through key applications: Bayesian probabilistic programming is demonstrated through integration with LazyPPL, a lazy probabilistic programming library; molecules are made instances of a group under rotation, necessary for geometric learning techniques which exploit the invariance of molecular properties under different representations; and the framework's flexibility is demonstrated through an extension to model chemical reactions. After critiquing previous representations, we provide an open-source solution in Haskell - a type-safe, purely functional programming language.</p></details> | 1 Figure |
| **[Representational Alignment with Chemical Induced Fit for Molecular Relational Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07027v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) is widely applied in natural sciences to predict relationships between molecular pairs by extracting structural features. The representational similarity between substructure pairs determines the functional compatibility of molecular binding sites. Nevertheless, aligning substructure representations by attention mechanisms lacks guidance from chemical knowledge, resulting in unstable model performance in chemical space (\textit{e.g.}, functional group, scaffold) shifted data. With theoretical justification, we propose the \textbf{Re}presentational \textbf{Align}ment with Chemical Induced \textbf{Fit} (ReAlignFit) to enhance the stability of MRL. ReAlignFit dynamically aligns substructure representation in MRL by introducing chemical Induced Fit-based inductive bias. In the induction process, we design the Bias Correction Function based on substructure edge reconstruction to align representations between substructure pairs by simulating chemical conformational changes (dynamic combination of substructures). ReAlignFit further integrates the Subgraph Information Bottleneck during fit process to refine and optimize substructure pairs exhibiting high chemical functional compatibility, leveraging them to generate molecular embeddings. Experimental results on nine datasets demonstrate that ReAlignFit outperforms state-of-the-art models in two tasks and significantly enhances model's stability in both rule-shifted and scaffold-shifted data distributions.</p></details> |  |

Although diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, these models typically adapt from the frameworks designed for image generation, making them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose a novel Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff) model that follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum and is guided by higher-order information, enabling the progressive generation of plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiminghh/HOG-Diff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mol-LLM: Generalist Molecular LLM with Improved Graph Utilization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02810v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have motivated the development of general LLMs for molecular tasks. While several studies have demonstrated that fine-tuned LLMs can achieve impressive benchmark performances, they are far from genuine generalist molecular LLMs due to a lack of fundamental understanding of molecular structure. Specifically, when given molecular task instructions, LLMs trained with naive next-token prediction training assign similar likelihood scores to both original and negatively corrupted molecules, revealing their lack of molecular structure understanding that is crucial for reliable and general molecular LLMs. To overcome this limitation and obtain a true generalist molecular LLM, we introduce a novel multi-modal training method based on a thorough multi-modal instruction tuning as well as a molecular structure preference optimization between chosen and rejected graphs. On various molecular benchmarks, the proposed generalist molecular LLM, called Mol-LLM, achieves state-of-the-art performances among generalist LLMs on most tasks, at the same time, surpassing or comparable to state-of-the-art specialist LLMs. Moreover, Mol-LLM also shows superior generalization performances in reaction prediction tasks, demonstrating the effect of the molecular structure understanding for generalization perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling on Lie Groups via Euclidean Generalized Score Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02513v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We extend Euclidean score-based diffusion processes to generative modeling on Lie groups. Through the formalism of Generalized Score Matching, our approach yields a Langevin dynamics which decomposes as a direct sum of Lie algebra representations, enabling generative processes on Lie groups while operating in Euclidean space. Unlike equivariant models, which restrict the space of learnable functions by quotienting out group orbits, our method can model any target distribution on any (non-Abelian) Lie group. Standard score matching emerges as a special case of our framework when the Lie group is the translation group. We prove that our generalized generative processes arise as solutions to a new class of paired stochastic differential equations (SDEs), introduced here for the first time. We validate our approach through experiments on diverse data types, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications such as SO(3)-guided molecular conformer generation and modeling ligand-specific global SE(3) transformations for molecular docking, showing improvement in comparison to Riemannian diffusion on the group itself. We show that an appropriate choice of Lie group enhances learning efficiency by reducing the effective dimensionality of the trajectory space and enables the modeling of transitions between complex data distributions. Additionally, we demonstrate the universality of our approach by deriving how it extends to flow matching.</p></details> | 27 pages |

At the core of our approach is a reversible "flattening" process that transforms graphs into random sequences. By sampling and learning from these sequences, AutoGraph enables transformers to model and generate complex graph structures in a manner akin to natural language. In contrast to diffusion models that rely on computationally intensive node features, our approach operates exclusively on these sequences. The sampling complexity and sequence length scale linearly with the number of edges, making AutoGraph highly scalable for generating large sparse graphs. Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse synthetic and molecular graph generation benchmarks, while delivering a 100-fold generation and a 3-fold training speedup compared to leading diffusion models. Additionally, it demonstrates promising transfer capabilities and supports substructure-conditioned generation without additional fine-tuning. By extending language modeling techniques to graph generation, this work paves the way for developing graph foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Docking-Aware Attention: Dynamic Protein Representations through Molecular Context Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01461v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational prediction of enzymatic reactions represents a crucial challenge in sustainable chemical synthesis across various scientific domains, ranging from drug discovery to materials science and green chemistry. These syntheses rely on proteins that selectively catalyze complex molecular transformations. These protein catalysts exhibit remarkable substrate adaptability, with the same protein often catalyzing different chemical transformations depending on its molecular partners. Current approaches to protein representation in reaction prediction either ignore protein structure entirely or rely on static embeddings, failing to capture how proteins dynamically adapt their behavior to different substrates. We present Docking-Aware Attention (DAA), a novel architecture that generates dynamic, context-dependent protein representations by incorporating molecular docking information into the attention mechanism. DAA combines physical interaction scores from docking predictions with learned attention patterns to focus on protein regions most relevant to specific molecular interactions. We evaluate our method on enzymatic reaction prediction, where it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 62.2\% accuracy versus 56.79\% on complex molecules and 55.54\% versus 49.45\% on innovative reactions. Through detailed ablation studies and visualizations, we demonstrate how DAA generates interpretable attention patterns that adapt to different molecular contexts. Our approach represents a general framework for context-aware protein representation in biocatalysis prediction, with potential applications across enzymatic synthesis planning. We open-source our implementation and pre-trained models to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable Boltzmann Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14426v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of equilibrium samples of molecular systems has been a long-standing problem in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators are a generative machine learning method that addresses this issue by learning a transformation via a normalizing flow from a simple prior distribution to the target Boltzmann distribution of interest. Recently, flow matching has been employed to train Boltzmann Generators for small molecular systems in Cartesian coordinates. We extend this work and propose a first framework for Boltzmann Generators that are transferable across chemical space, such that they predict zero-shot Boltzmann distributions for test molecules without being retrained for these systems. These transferable Boltzmann Generators allow approximate sampling from the target distribution of unseen systems, as well as efficient reweighting to the target Boltzmann distribution. The transferability of the proposed framework is evaluated on dipeptides, where we show that it generalizes efficiently to unseen systems.

Here we introduce the QMe14S dataset, comprising 186,102 small organic molecules featuring 14 elements (H, B, C, N, O, F, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, As, Se, Br) and 47 functional groups. Using density functional theory at the B3LYP/TZVP level, we optimized the geometries and calculated properties including energy, atomic charge, atomic force, dipole moment, quadrupole moment, polarizability, octupole moment, first hyperpolarizability, and Hessian. At the same level, we obtained the harmonic IR, Raman and NMR spectra. Furthermore, we conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to generate dynamic configurations and extract nonequilibrium properties, including energy, forces, and Hessians. By leveraging our E(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network (DetaNet), we demonstrated that models trained on QMe14S outperform those trained on the previously developed QM9S dataset in simulating molecular spectra. The QMe14S dataset thus serves as a comprehensive benchmark for molecular simulations, offering valuable insights into structure-property relationships.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4figures |

Despite their strong predictive capabilities, these models lack a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty, which is key in scientific applications such as PDE solving, molecular generation and Machine Learning Force Fields. To address this shortcoming we present BARNN: a variational Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network. BARNNs aim to provide a principled way to turn any autoregressive or recurrent model into its Bayesian version. BARNN is based on the variational dropout method, allowing to apply it to large recurrent neural networks as well. We also introduce a temporal version of the "Variational Mixtures of Posteriors" prior (tVAMP-prior) to make Bayesian inference efficient and well-calibrated. Extensive experiments on PDE modelling and molecular generation demonstrate that BARNN not only achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, but also excels in uncertainty quantification and modelling long-range dependencies.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for chemicals. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Discrete Denoising Diffusion Model for Molecular Generation with OpenFL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12523v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating unique molecules with biochemically desired properties to serve as viable drug candidates is a difficult task that requires specialized domain expertise. In recent years, diffusion models have shown promising results in accelerating the drug design process through AI-driven molecular generation. However, training these models requires massive amounts of data, which are often isolated in proprietary silos. OpenFL is a federated learning framework that enables privacy-preserving collaborative training across these decentralized data sites. In this work, we present a federated discrete denoising diffusion model that was trained using OpenFL. The federated model achieves comparable performance with a model trained on centralized data when evaluating the uniqueness and validity of the generated molecules. This demonstrates the utility of federated learning in the drug design process. OpenFL is available at: https://github.com/securefederatedai/openfl</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Learning to generate feasible graphs using graph grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06003v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative methods for graphs need to be sufficiently flexible to model complex dependencies between sets of nodes. At the same time, the generated graphs need to satisfy domain-dependent feasibility conditions, that is, they should not violate certain constraints that would make their interpretation impossible within the given application domain (e.g. a molecular graph where an atom has a very large number of chemical bounds). Crucially, constraints can involve not only local but also long-range dependencies: for example, the maximal length of a cycle can be bounded. Currently, a large class of generative approaches for graphs, such as methods based on artificial neural networks, is based on message passing schemes. These approaches suffer from information 'dilution' issues that severely limit the maximal range of the dependencies that can be modeled. To address this problem, we propose a generative approach based on the notion of graph grammars. The key novel idea is to introduce a domain-dependent coarsening procedure to provide short-cuts for long-range dependencies. We show the effectiveness of our proposal in two domains: 1) small drugs and 2) RNA secondary structures. In the first case, we compare the quality of the generated molecular graphs via the Molecular Sets (MOSES) benchmark suite, which evaluates the distance between generated and real molecules, their lipophilicity, synthesizability, and drug-likeness. In the second case, we show that the approach can generate very large graphs (with hundreds of nodes) that are accepted as valid examples for a desired RNA family by the "Infernal" covariance model, a state-of-the-art RNA classifier. Our implementation is available on github: github.com/fabriziocosta/GraphLearn</p></details> |  |

MOFA addresses key challenges in integrating GPU-accelerated computing for GPU-intensive GenAI tasks, including distributed training and inference, alongside CPU- and GPU-optimized tasks for screening and filtering AI-generated MOFs using molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and Monte Carlo simulations. These heterogeneous tasks are unified within an online learning framework that optimizes the utilization of available CPU and GPU resources across HPC systems. Performance metrics from a 450-node (14,400 AMD Zen 3 CPUs + 1800 NVIDIA A100 GPUs) supercomputer run demonstrate that MOFA achieves high-throughput generation of novel MOF structures, with CO$_2$ adsorption capacities ranking among the top 10 in the hypothetical MOF (hMOF) dataset. Furthermore, the production of high-quality MOFs exhibits a linear relationship with the number of nodes utilized. The modular architecture of MOFA will facilitate its integration into other scientific applications that dynamically combine GenAI with large-scale simulations.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Molecular Graph Contrastive Learning with Line Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08589v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trapped by the label scarcity in molecular property prediction and drug design, graph contrastive learning (GCL) came forward. Leading contrastive learning works show two kinds of view generators, that is, random or learnable data corruption and domain knowledge incorporation. While effective, the two ways also lead to molecular semantics altering and limited generalization capability, respectively. To this end, we relate the \textbf{L}in\textbf{E} graph with \textbf{MO}lecular graph co\textbf{N}trastive learning and propose a novel method termed \textit{LEMON}. Specifically, by contrasting the given graph with the corresponding line graph, the graph encoder can freely encode the molecular semantics without omission. Furthermore, we present a new patch with edge attribute fusion and two local contrastive losses enhance information transmission and tackle hard negative samples. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for view generation, superior performance on molecular property prediction suggests the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Using this representation, we propose a new model based on walk-jump sampling for unconditional 3D molecule generation in the continuous space using neural fields. Our model, FuncMol, encodes molecular fields into latent codes using a conditional neural field, samples noisy codes from a Gaussian-smoothed distribution with Langevin MCMC (walk), denoises these samples in a single step (jump), and finally decodes them into molecular fields. FuncMol performs all-atom generation of 3D molecules without assumptions on the molecular structure and scales well with the size of molecules, unlike most approaches. Our method achieves competitive results on drug-like molecules and easily scales to macro-cyclic peptides, with at least one order of magnitude faster sampling.

| **[GDiffRetro: Retrosynthesis Prediction with Dual Graph Enhanced Molecular Representation and Diffusion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08001v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrosynthesis prediction focuses on identifying reactants capable of synthesizing a target product. Typically, the retrosynthesis prediction involves two phases: Reaction Center Identification and Reactant Generation. However, we argue that most existing methods suffer from two limitations in the two phases: (i) Existing models do not adequately capture the ``face'' information in molecular graphs for the reaction center identification. (ii) Current approaches for the reactant generation predominantly use sequence generation in a 2D space, which lacks versatility in generating reasonable distributions for completed reactive groups and overlooks molecules' inherent 3D properties. To overcome the above limitations, we propose GDiffRetro. For the reaction center identification, GDiffRetro uniquely integrates the original graph with its corresponding dual graph to represent molecular structures, which helps guide the model to focus more on the faces in the graph. For the reactant generation, GDiffRetro employs a conditional diffusion model in 3D to further transform the obtained synthon into a complete reactant. Our experimental findings reveal that GDiffRetro outperforms state-of-the-art semi-template models across various evaluative metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[D3MES: Diffusion Transformer with multihead equivariant self-attention for 3D molecule generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07077v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting the diverse conformational states of molecules is crucial for advancing fields such as chemistry, material science, and drug development. Despite significant progress in generative models, accurately generating complex and biologically or material-relevant molecular structures remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model for three-dimensional (3D) molecule generation that combines a classifiable diffusion model, Diffusion Transformer, with multihead equivariant self-attention. This method addresses two key challenges: correctly attaching hydrogen atoms in generated molecules through learning representations of molecules after hydrogen atoms are removed; and overcoming the limitations of existing models that cannot generate molecules across multiple classes simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that our model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across several key metrics but also exhibits robustness and versatility, making it highly suitable for early-stage large-scale generation processes in molecular design, followed by validation and further screening to obtain molecules with specific properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenMol: A Drug Discovery Generalist with Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06158v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is a complex process that involves multiple scenarios and stages, such as fragment-constrained molecule generation, hit generation and lead optimization. However, existing molecular generative models can only tackle one or two of these scenarios and lack the flexibility to address various aspects of the drug discovery pipeline. In this paper, we present Generalist Molecular generative model (GenMol), a versatile framework that addresses these limitations by applying discrete diffusion to the Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) molecular representation. GenMol generates SAFE sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering and enhanced computational efficiency. Moreover, under the discrete diffusion framework, we introduce fragment remasking, a strategy that optimizes molecules by replacing fragments with masked tokens and regenerating them, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model trained on SAFE representations in de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization. These experimental results demonstrate that GenMol can tackle a wide range of drug discovery tasks, providing a unified and versatile approach for molecular design.</p></details> |  |

Recently developed deep learning methods, particularly diffusion models have reached competitive performance over traditional cheminformatical approaches. However, these methods are often time-consuming or require extra support from traditional methods. We propose EquiBoost, a boosting model that stacks several equivariant graph transformers as weak learners, to iteratively refine 3D conformations of molecules. Without relying on diffusion techniques, EquiBoost balances accuracy and efficiency more effectively than diffusion-based methods. Notably, compared to the previous state-of-the-art diffusion method, EquiBoost improves generation quality and preserves diversity, achieving considerably better precision of Average Minimum RMSD (AMR) on the GEOM datasets. This work rejuvenates boosting and sheds light on its potential to be a robust alternative to diffusion models in certain scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MADGEN: Mass-Spec attends to De Novo Molecular generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01950v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The annotation (assigning structural chemical identities) of MS/MS spectra remains a significant challenge due to the enormous molecular diversity in biological samples and the limited scope of reference databases. Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the "dark chemical space" without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Exploring Molecule Generation Using Latent Space Graph Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03696v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating molecular graphs is a challenging task due to their discrete nature and the competitive objectives involved. Diffusion models have emerged as SOTA approaches in data generation across various modalities. For molecular graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) as a diffusion backbone have achieved impressive results. Latent space diffusion, where diffusion occurs in a low-dimensional space via an autoencoder, has demonstrated computational efficiency. However, the literature on latent space diffusion for molecular graphs is scarce, and no commonly accepted best practices exist. In this work, we explore different approaches and hyperparameters, contrasting generative flow models (denoising diffusion, flow matching, heat dissipation) and architectures (GNNs and E(3)-equivariant GNNs). Our experiments reveal a high sensitivity to the choice of approach and design decisions.

| **[Navigating Chemical-Linguistic Sharing Space with Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20888v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical language models (CLMs) are prominent for their effectiveness in exploring chemical space and enabling molecular engineering. However, while exploring chemical-linguistic space, CLMs suffer from the gap between natural language and molecular representations. This challenge is primarily due to the inherent modeling differences between molecules and texts: molecules operate unified modeling to learn chemical space, while natural language sequentially models the semantic space. Additionally, the limited availability of high-quality text-to-molecule datasets further exacerbates this challenge. To address the problem, we first verified the information bias in molecular representations from different perspectives. We then developed the Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding (HME) framework, a unified molecular encoder compressing the molecular features from fragment sequence, topology, and conformation with Q-learning. To better model chemical-linguistic space, we further constructed the MCMoD dataset, which contains over one million molecules with various conditions, including properties, fragments, and descriptions. Experimentally, HME promotes CLMs to achieve chemical-linguistic sharing space exploration: (1) chemical space exploration with linguistic guidance, where HME achieves significant improvements (+8.9\% FCD) for molecular design in multiple constraints, even in zero-shot scenarios; (2) linguistic space exploration with molecular guidance, where HME generates textual descriptions with high qualities (+11.6\% BLEU) for molecules. These results highlight the precision of HME in handling multi-objective and cross-domain tasks, as well as its remarkable generalization capability on unseen task combinations. HME offers a new perspective on navigating chemical-linguistic sharing space, advancing the potential of CLMs in both fundamental research and practical applications in chemistry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

We show how applications such as structure-based, fragment-based, and ligand-based drug design are formulated in the UniGuide framework and demonstrate on-par or superior performance compared to specialised models.

We find that a key limitation is not in the molecule generation process itself, but in the poor generalization capabilities of molecular property predictors. We tackle this challenge by creating an active-learning, closed-loop molecule generation pipeline, whereby molecular generative models are iteratively refined on feedback from quantum chemical simulations to improve generalization to new chemical space. Compared against other generative model approaches, only our active learning approach generates molecules with properties that extrapolate beyond the training data (reaching up to 0.44 standard deviations beyond the training data range) and out-of-distribution molecule classification accuracy is improved by 79%. By conditioning molecular generation on thermodynamic stability data from the active-learning loop, the proportion of stable molecules generated is 3.5x higher than the next-best model.</p></details> |  |

Most methods in previous studies learn the semantics and syntax of molecular structures by analyzing molecular graphs or simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings; however, they do not take into account the drug responses of the biological systems consisting of genes and proteins. In this study we propose a deep generative model, Gx2Mol, which utilizes gene expression profiles to generate molecular structures with desirable phenotypes for arbitrary target proteins. In the algorithm, a variational autoencoder is employed as a feature extractor to learn the latent feature distribution of the gene expression profiles. Then, a long short-term memory is leveraged as the chemical generator to produce syntactically valid SMILES strings that satisfy the feature conditions of the gene expression profile extracted by the feature extractor. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that the proposed Gx2Mol model can produce new molecules with potential bioactivities and drug-like properties.</p></details> |  |

Dissipativity is a crucial indicator for dynamical systems that generalizes stability and input-output stability, known to be valid across various systems including robotics, biological systems, and molecular dynamics. By analytically proving the general solution to the nonlinear Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for dissipativity, we propose a differentiable projection that transforms any dynamics represented by neural networks into dissipative ones and a learning method for the transformed dynamics. Utilizing the generality of dissipativity, our method strictly guarantee stability, input-output stability, and energy conservation of trained dynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method against out-of-domain input through applications to robotic arms and fluid dynamics.

However, in molecular science, CMs are less common than black-box models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), due to their need for predefined concepts and manual labeling. This paper introduces the Automated Molecular Concept (AutoMolCo) framework, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate and label predictive molecular concepts. Through iterative concept refinement, AutoMolCo enables simple linear models to outperform GNNs and LLM in-context learning on several benchmarks. The framework operates without human knowledge input, overcoming limitations of existing CMs while maintaining explainability and allowing easy intervention. Experiments on MoleculeNet and High-Throughput Experimentation (HTE) datasets demonstrate that AutoMolCo-induced explainable CMs are beneficial for molecular science research.</p></details> |  |

More recently, these workflows have been significantly augmented with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and systems of autonomous agents capable of utilizing pre-trained models to make predictions in the context of more complex research tasks. While effective, there is still room for substantial improvement within agentic systems on the retrieval of salient information for material design tasks. Within this context, alternative uses of predictive deep learning models, such as leveraging their latent representations to facilitate cross-modal retrieval augmented generation within agentic systems for task-specific materials design, has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained chemistry foundation models can serve as a basis for enabling structure-focused, semantic chemistry information retrieval for both small-molecules, complex polymeric materials, and reactions. Additionally, we show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with multi-modal models such as OpenCLIP facilitate unprecedented queries and information retrieval across multiple characterization data domains. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of these models within multi-agent systems to facilitate structure and topological-based natural language queries and information retrieval for different research tasks.</p></details> |  |

Here we hypothesized that ORs can be viewed as 3D spatial filters that extract molecular features relevant to the olfactory system, similarly to the spatio-temporal filters found in other sensory modalities. To build these filters, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict human olfactory percepts obtained from several semantic datasets. Our neural network, the DeepNose, produced responses that are approximately invariant to the molecules' orientation, due to its equivariant architecture. Our network offers high-fidelity perceptual predictions for different olfactory datasets. In addition, our approach allows us to identify molecular features that contribute to specific perceptual descriptors. Because the DeepNose network is designed to be aligned with the biological system, our approach predicts distinct perceptual qualities for different stereoisomers. The architecture of the DeepNose relying on the processing of several molecules at the same time permits inferring the perceptual quality of odor mixtures. We propose that the DeepNose network can use 3D molecular shapes to generate high-quality predictions for human olfactory percepts and help identify molecular features responsible for odor quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, to be appear in the proceedings of Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (ACSSC 2024)</p></details> |

While early work has shown that ML-based retrosynthesis models can predict reasonable routes, their low accuracy for less frequent, yet important reactions has been pointed out. As multi-step search algorithms are limited to reactions suggested by the underlying model, the applicability of those tools is inherently constrained by the accuracy of retrosynthesis prediction. Inspired by how chemists use different strategies to ideate reactions, we propose Chimera: a framework for building highly accurate reaction models that combine predictions from diverse sources with complementary inductive biases using a learning-based ensembling strategy. We instantiate the framework with two newly developed models, which already by themselves achieve state of the art in their categories. Through experiments across several orders of magnitude in data scale and time-splits, we show Chimera outperforms all major models by a large margin, owing both to the good individual performance of its constituents, but also to the scalability of our ensembling strategy. Moreover, we find that PhD-level organic chemists prefer predictions from Chimera over baselines in terms of quality. Finally, we transfer the largest-scale checkpoint to an internal dataset from a major pharmaceutical company, showing robust generalization under distribution shift. With the new dimension that our framework unlocks, we anticipate further acceleration in the development of even more accurate models.</p></details> |  |

The model captures the information of the forces and local constraints between atoms so that the generated molecules can maintain Euclidean transformation and high level of effectiveness and diversity. We also use the lowerrank manifold advantage of the latent variables of the latent model to fuse the information of the forces between atoms to better maintain the geometric equivariant properties of the molecules. Because there is no need to perform information fusion encoding in stages like traditional encoders and decoders, this reduces the amount of calculation in the back-propagation process. The model keeps the forces and local constraints of particle bonds in the latent variable space, reducing the impact of underfitting on the surface of the network on the large position drift of the particle geometry, so that our model can converge earlier. We introduce a distribution control variable in each backward step to strengthen exploration and improve the diversity of generation. In the experiment, the quality of the samples we generated and the convergence speed of the model have been significantly improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.05710 by other authors</p></details> |

However, extending these models to generate 3D molecular structures presents significant challenges. Two primary obstacles emerge: (1) the difficulty in designing a 3D line notation that ensures SE(3)-invariant atomic coordinates, and (2) the non-trivial task of tokenizing continuous coordinates for use in LMs, which inherently require discrete inputs. To address these challenges, we propose Mol-StrucTok, a novel method for tokenizing 3D molecular structures. Our approach comprises two key innovations: (1) We design a line notation for 3D molecules by extracting local atomic coordinates in a spherical coordinate system. This notation builds upon existing 2D line notations and remains agnostic to their specific forms, ensuring compatibility with various molecular representation schemes. (2) We employ a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to tokenize these coordinates, treating them as generation descriptors. To further enhance the representation, we incorporate neighborhood bond lengths and bond angles as understanding descriptors. Leveraging this tokenization framework, we train a GPT-2 style model for 3D molecular generation tasks. Results demonstrate strong performance with significantly faster generation speeds and competitive chemical stability compared to previous methods. Further, by integrating our learned discrete representations into Graphormer model for property prediction on QM9 dataset, Mol-StrucTok reveals consistent improvements across various molecular properties, underscoring the versatility and robustness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, preprint</p></details> |

While traditional methods for designing new ionizable lipids are typically time-consuming, deep generative models have emerged as a powerful solution, significantly accelerating the molecular discovery process. However, a practical challenge arises as the molecular structures generated can often be difficult or infeasible to synthesize. This project explores Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)-based generative models for synthesizable ionizable lipids. Leveraging a synthetically accessible lipid building block dataset and two specialized predictors to guide the search through chemical space, we introduce a policy network guided MCTS generative model capable of producing new ionizable lipids with available synthesis pathways.</p></details> |  |
| **[Riemannian Denoising Score Matching for Molecular Structure Optimization with Accurate Energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19769v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a modified score matching method aimed at generating molecular structures with high energy accuracy. The denoising process of score matching or diffusion models mirrors molecular structure optimization, where scores act like physical force fields that guide particles toward equilibrium states. To achieve energetically accurate structures, it can be advantageous to have the score closely approximate the gradient of the actual potential energy surface. Unlike conventional methods that simply design the target score based on structural differences in Euclidean space, we propose a Riemannian score matching approach. This method represents molecular structures on a manifold defined by physics-informed internal coordinates to efficiently mimic the energy landscape, and performs noising and denoising within this space. Our method has been evaluated by refining several types of starting structures on the QM9 and GEOM datasets, demonstrating that the proposed Riemannian score matching method significantly improves the accuracy of the generated molecular structures, attaining chemical accuracy. The implications of this study extend to various applications in computational chemistry, offering a robust tool for accurate molecular structure prediction.</p></details> |  |

| **[Balancing Molecular Information and Empirical Data in the Prediction of Physico-Chemical Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08075v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the physico-chemical properties of pure substances and mixtures is a central task in thermodynamics. Established prediction methods range from fully physics-based ab-initio calculations, which are only feasible for very simple systems, over descriptor-based methods that use some information on the molecules to be modeled together with fitted model parameters (e.g., quantitative-structure-property relationship methods or classical group contribution methods), to representation-learning methods, which may, in extreme cases, completely ignore molecular descriptors and extrapolate only from existing data on the property to be modeled (e.g., matrix completion methods). In this work, we propose a general method for combining molecular descriptors with representation learning using the so-called expectation maximization algorithm from the probabilistic machine learning literature, which uses uncertainty estimates to trade off between the two approaches. The proposed hybrid model exploits chemical structure information using graph neural networks, but it automatically detects cases where structure-based predictions are unreliable, in which case it corrects them by representation-learning based predictions that can better specialize to unusual cases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the prediction of activity coefficients in binary mixtures as an example. The results are compelling, as the method significantly improves predictive accuracy over the current state of the art, showcasing its potential to advance the prediction of physico-chemical properties in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, including 11 pages of main text and 3 pages of appendix, added analysis of improvements in predictive accuracy, added Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7</p></details> |

Flow matching is a recently proposed generative modeling framework that has achieved impressive performance on a variety of tasks including those on biomolecular structures. The seminal flow matching framework was developed only for continuous data. However, de novo molecular design tasks require generating discrete data such as atomic elements or sequences of amino acid residues. Several discrete flow matching methods have been proposed recently to address this gap. In this work we benchmark the performance of existing discrete flow matching methods for 3D de novo small molecule generation and provide explanations of their differing behavior. As a result we present FlowMol-CTMC, an open-source model that achieves state of the art performance for 3D de novo design with fewer learnable parameters than existing methods. Additionally, we propose the use of metrics that capture molecule quality beyond local chemical valency constraints and towards higher-order structural motifs. These metrics show that even though basic constraints are satisfied, the models tend to produce unusual and potentially problematic functional groups outside of the training data distribution. Code and trained models for reproducing this work are available at \url{https://github.com/dunni3/FlowMol}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the NeurIPS 2024 Machine Learning for Structural Biology Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Limeade: Let integer molecular encoding aid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16623v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is a well-established framework for computer-aided molecular design (CAMD). By precisely encoding the molecular space and score functions, e.g., a graph neural network, the molecular design problem is represented and solved as an optimization problem, the solution of which corresponds to a molecule with optimal score. However, both the extremely large search space and complicated scoring process limit the use of MIP-based CAMD to specific and tiny problems. Moreover, optimal molecule may not be meaningful in practice if scores are imperfect. Instead of pursuing optimality, this paper exploits the ability of MIP in molecular generation and proposes Limeade as an end-to-end tool from real-world needs to feasible molecules. Beyond the basic constraints for structural feasibility, Limeade supports inclusion and exclusion of SMARTS patterns, automating the process of interpreting and formulating chemical requirements to mathematical constraints.</p></details> | 32 pages, 2 figures |

However, molecules are not solely characterized by atom/bond symbols; they encapsulate important physical/chemical properties. Moreover, normal language models bring grammar rules that are irrelevant for understanding molecules. In this study, we propose a novel physicochemical knowledge-guided molecular meta language framework MolMetaLM. We design a molecule-specialized meta language paradigm, formatted as multiple <S,P,O> (subject, predicate, object) knowledge triples sharing the same S (i.e., molecule) to enhance learning the semantic relationships between physicochemical knowledge and molecules. By introducing different molecular knowledge and noises, the meta language paradigm generates tens of thousands of pretraining tasks. By recovering the token/sequence/order-level noises, MolMetaLM exhibits proficiency in large-scale benchmark evaluations involving property prediction, molecule generation, conformation inference, and molecular optimization. Through MolMetaLM, we offer a new insight for designing language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Practical and Asymptotically Exact Conditional Sampling in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17775v2)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been successful on a range of conditional generation tasks including molecular design and text-to-image generation. However, these achievements have primarily depended on task-specific conditional training or error-prone heuristic approximations. Ideally, a conditional generation method should provide exact samples for a broad range of conditional distributions without requiring task-specific training. To this end, we introduce the Twisted Diffusion Sampler, or TDS. TDS is a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that targets the conditional distributions of diffusion models through simulating a set of weighted particles. The main idea is to use twisting, an SMC technique that enjoys good computational efficiency, to incorporate heuristic approximations without compromising asymptotic exactness. We first find in simulation and in conditional image generation tasks that TDS provides a computational statistical trade-off, yielding more accurate approximations with many particles but with empirical improvements over heuristics with as few as two particles. We then turn to motif-scaffolding, a core task in protein design, using a TDS extension to Riemannian diffusion models. On benchmark test cases, TDS allows flexible conditioning criteria and often outperforms the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/blt2114/twisted_diffusion_sampler</p></details> |

Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods often overlook structural information. However, feature engineering-based methods usually merely focus on binding affinity prediction without substantial molecular modification. To address this, we present Graph-based Topological Reinforcement Learning (GraphTRL), which integrates both chemical and structural data for improved molecular generation. GraphTRL leverages multiscale weighted colored graphs (MWCG) and persistent homology, combined with molecular fingerprints, as the state space for RL. Evaluations show that GraphTRL outperforms existing methods in binding affinity prediction, offering a promising approach to accelerate drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolReFlect: Towards In-Context Fine-grained Alignments between Molecules and Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14721v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecule discovery is a pivotal research field, impacting everything from the medicines we take to the materials we use. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in molecule understanding and generation, yet the alignments between molecules and their corresponding captions remain a significant challenge. Previous endeavours often treat the molecule as a general SMILES string or molecular graph, neglecting the fine-grained alignments between the molecular sub-structures and the descriptive textual phrases, which are crucial for accurate and explainable predictions. In this case, we introduce MolReFlect, a novel teacher-student framework designed to contextually perform the molecule-caption alignments in a fine-grained way. Our approach initially leverages a larger teacher LLM to label the detailed alignments by directly extracting critical phrases from molecule captions or SMILES strings and implying them to corresponding sub-structures or characteristics. To refine these alignments, we propose In-Context Selective Reflection, which retrieves previous extraction results as context examples for teacher LLM to reflect and lets a smaller student LLM select from in-context reflection and previous extraction results. Finally, we enhance the learning process of the student LLM through Chain-of-Thought In-Context Molecule Tuning, integrating the fine-grained alignments and the reasoning processes within the Chain-of-Thought format. Our experimental results demonstrate that MolReFlect enables LLMs like Mistral-7B to significantly outperform the previous baselines, achieving SOTA performance on the ChEBI-20 dataset. This advancement not only enhances the generative capabilities of LLMs in the molecule-caption translation task, but also contributes to a more explainable framework.</p></details> | 22 pages, 12 figures |

Recently, ligand-based virtual screening has garnered significant attention due to its efficacy in conducting extensive database screenings without relying on specific protein-binding site information. Obtaining binding affinity data for complexes is highly expensive, resulting in a limited amount of available data that covers a relatively small chemical space. Moreover, these datasets contain a significant amount of inconsistent noise. It is challenging to identify an inductive bias that consistently maintains the integrity of molecular activity during data augmentation. To tackle these challenges, we propose S-MolSearch, the first framework to our knowledge, that leverages molecular 3D information and affinity information in semi-supervised contrastive learning for ligand-based virtual screening. Drawing on the principles of inverse optimal transport, S-MolSearch efficiently processes both labeled and unlabeled data, training molecular structural encoders while generating soft labels for the unlabeled data. This design allows S-MolSearch to adaptively utilize unlabeled data within the learning process. Empirically, S-MolSearch demonstrates superior performance on widely-used benchmarks LIT-PCBA and DUD-E. It surpasses both structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening methods for AUROC, BEDROC and EF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molecule Generation with Fragment Retrieval Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12078v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fragment-based drug discovery, in which molecular fragments are assembled into new molecules with desirable biochemical properties, has achieved great success. However, many fragment-based molecule generation methods show limited exploration beyond the existing fragments in the database as they only reassemble or slightly modify the given ones. To tackle this problem, we propose a new fragment-based molecule generation framework with retrieval augmentation, namely Fragment Retrieval-Augmented Generation (f-RAG). f-RAG is based on a pre-trained molecular generative model that proposes additional fragments from input fragments to complete and generate a new molecule. Given a fragment vocabulary, f-RAG retrieves two types of fragments: (1) hard fragments, which serve as building blocks that will be explicitly included in the newly generated molecule, and (2) soft fragments, which serve as reference to guide the generation of new fragments through a trainable fragment injection module. To extrapolate beyond the existing fragments, f-RAG updates the fragment vocabulary with generated fragments via an iterative refinement process which is further enhanced with post-hoc genetic fragment modification. f-RAG can achieve an improved exploration-exploitation trade-off by maintaining a pool of fragments and expanding it with novel and high-quality fragments through a strong generative prior.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

In this study, we introduce a neuroevolution potential (NEP), trained on a dataset generated from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, using the moment tensor potential (MTP) as a reference. The low root mean square errors (RMSEs) for total energy and atomic forces demonstrate the high accuracy and transferability of both the MTP and NEP. We further calculate the phonon density of states (DOS) and radial distribution function (RDF) using both machine learning potentials, comparing the results to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the MTP potential offers slightly higher accuracy, the NEP achieves a remarkable 41-fold increase in computational speed. These findings provide detailed microscopic insights into the dynamics and rapid Cu-ion diffusion, paving the way for future studies on Cu-based solid electrolytes and their applications in energy devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the mold: overcoming the time constraints of molecular dynamics on general-purpose hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10532v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been intimately linked to that of computing hardware. For decades following the creation of MD, simulations have improved with computing power along the three principal dimensions of accuracy, atom count (spatial scale), and duration (temporal scale). Since the mid-2000s, computer platforms have however failed to provide strong scaling for MD as scale-out CPU and GPU platforms that provide substantial increases to spatial scale do not lead to proportional increases in temporal scale. Important scientific problems therefore remained inaccessible to direct simulation, prompting the development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms that present significant complexity, accuracy, and efficiency challenges. While bespoke MD-only hardware solutions have provided a path to longer timescales for specific physical systems, their impact on the broader community has been mitigated by their limited adaptability to new methods and potentials. In this work, we show that a novel computing architecture, the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine, completely alters the scaling path by delivering unprecedentedly high simulation rates up to 1.144M steps/second for 200,000 atoms whose interactions are described by an Embedded Atom Method potential. This enables direct simulations of the evolution of materials using general-purpose programmable hardware over millisecond timescales, dramatically increasing the space of direct MD simulations that can be carried out.</p></details> |  |

Despite the popularity of probabilistic generative models, numerical experiments benchmarking their performance on molecular data are lacking. In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: Neural Spline Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) Neural Spline Flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) Conditional Flow Matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models appears the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib\textsubscript{9} peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope our taxonomy of probabilistic generative frameworks and numerical results may guide model selection for a wide range of molecular tasks.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, it does not extract key substructures from a single patient visit, resulting in the failure to identify medication molecules suitable for the current patient visit. To address the above limitations, we propose a bimodal molecular recommendation framework named BiMoRec, which introduces 3D molecular structures to obtain atomic 3D coordinates and edge indices, overcoming the inherent lack of high-dimensional molecular information in 2D molecular structures. To retain the fast training and prediction efficiency of the recommendation system, we use bimodal graph contrastive pretraining to maximize the mutual information between the two molecular modalities, achieving the fusion of 2D and 3D molecular graphs. Additionally, we designed a molecular multi-step enhancement mechanism to re-calibrate the molecular weights. Specifically, we employ a pre-training method that captures both 2D and 3D molecular structure representations, along with substructure representations, and leverages contrastive learning to extract mutual information. We then use the pre-trained encoder to generate molecular representations, enhancing them through a three-step process: intra-visit, molecular per-visit, and latest-visit. Finally, we apply temporal information aggregation to generate the final medication combinations. Our implementation on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

These models have been developed inheriting from the advances in natural language processing and computer vision, achieving ever greater results. However, generative molecular modelling has unique challenges that are often overlooked. Chemical validity, interpretability of the generation process and flexibility to variable molecular sizes are among some of the remaining challenges for generative models in computational materials design. In this work, we propose an autoregressive approach that decomposes molecular generation into a sequence of discrete and interpretable steps using molecular fragments as units, a 'molecular story'. Enforcing chemical rules in the stories guarantees the chemical validity of the generated molecules, the discrete sequential steps of a molecular story makes the process transparent improving interpretability, and the autoregressive nature of the approach allows the size of the molecule to be a decision of the model. We demonstrate the validity of the approach in a multi-target inverse design of electroactive organic compounds, focusing on the target properties of solubility, redox potential, and synthetic accessibility. Our results show that the model can effectively bias the generation distribution according to the prompted multi-target objective.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present an exhaustive review of the latest advancements in graph representation learning and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, tailored to handle graph-structured data, excel in deriving insights and predictions from intricate relational information, making them invaluable for tasks involving such data. Graph representation learning, a pivotal approach in analyzing graph-structured data, facilitates numerous downstream tasks and applications across machine learning, data mining, biomedicine, and healthcare. Our work delves into the capabilities of GNNs, examining their foundational designs and their application in addressing real-world challenges. We introduce a GNN equipped with an advanced high-order pooling function, adept at capturing complex node interactions within graph-structured data. This pooling function significantly enhances the GNN's efficacy in both node- and graph-level tasks. Additionally, we propose a molecular graph generative model with a GNN as its core framework. This GNN backbone is proficient in learning invariant and equivariant molecular characteristics. Employing these features, the molecular graph generative model is capable of simultaneously learning and generating molecular graphs with atom-bond structures and precise atom positions.

However, the molecular generation process with diffusion models involves multiple autoregressive steps over a finite time horizon, leading to exposure bias issues inherently. To address the exposure bias issue, we propose a training framework named GapDiff. The core idea of GapDiff is to utilize model-predicted conformations as ground truth probabilistically during training, aiming to mitigate the data distributional disparity between training and inference, thereby enhancing the affinity of generated molecules. We conduct experiments using a 3D molecular generation model on the CrossDocked2020 dataset, and the vina energy and diversity demonstrate the potency of our framework with superior affinity.

However, most existing machine learning methods for small molecule generation suffer from poor synthesizability of candidate compounds, making experimental validation difficult. In this paper we propose Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), an extension of the GFlowNet framework that operates directly in the space of chemical reactions, thereby allowing out-of-the-box synthesizability while maintaining comparable quality of generated candidates. We demonstrate that with the proposed set of reactions and building blocks, it is possible to obtain a search space of molecules orders of magnitude larger than existing screening libraries coupled with low cost of synthesis. We also show that the approach scales to very large fragment libraries, further increasing the number of potential molecules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across a range of oracle models, including pretrained proxy models and GPU-accelerated docking.</p></details> |  |

These models demonstrate strong performance on a range of tasks; however, there has been evidence of brittleness when applied to more niche or narrow domains where hallucinations or fluent but incorrect responses reduce performance. Given the complex nature of scientific domains, it is prudent to investigate the trade-offs of leveraging off-the-shelf versus more targeted foundation models for scientific domains. In this work, we examine the benefits of in-domain pre-training for a given scientific domain, chemistry, and compare these to open-source, off-the-shelf models with zero-shot and few-shot prompting. Our results show that not only do in-domain base models perform reasonably well on in-domain tasks in a zero-shot setting but that further adaptation using instruction fine-tuning yields impressive performance on chemistry-specific tasks such as named entity recognition and molecular formula generation.</p></details> |  |

The junction tree variational autoencoder (JTVAE) has been shown to be an efficient generative model that can be used for suggesting legitimate novel drug-like small molecules with improved properties. While the performance of the generative molecular design (GMD) scheme strongly depends on the initial training data, one can improve its sampling efficiency for suggesting better molecules with enhanced properties by optimizing the latent space. In this work, we propose how mechanistic models - such as pathway models described by differential equations - can be used for effective latent space optimization(LSO) of JTVAEs and other similar models for GMD. To demonstrate the potential of our proposed approach, we show how a pharmacodynamic model, assessing the therapeutic efficacy of a drug-like small molecule by predicting how it modulates a cancer pathway, can be incorporated for effective LSO of data-driven models for GMD.</p></details> |  |

Active learning, which uses biased or unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) to generate candidate pools, aims to address this objective. Existing biased and unbiased MD-simulation methods, however, are prone to miss either rare events or extrapolative regions -- areas of the configurational space where unreliable predictions are made. This work demonstrates that MD, when biased by the MLIP's energy uncertainty, simultaneously captures extrapolative regions and rare events, which is crucial for developing uniformly accurate MLIPs. Furthermore, exploiting automatic differentiation, we enhance bias-forces-driven MD with the concept of bias stress. We employ calibrated gradient-based uncertainties to yield MLIPs with similar or, sometimes, better accuracy than ensemble-based methods at a lower computational cost. Finally, we apply uncertainty-biased MD to alanine dipeptide and MIL-53(Al), generating MLIPs that represent both configurational spaces more accurately than models trained with conventional MD.</p></details> |  |

However, conditional molecular generation remains a fundamental challenge due to an intrinsic trade-off between targeting specific chemical properties and generating meaningful samples from the data distribution. In this work, we present Time-Aware Conditional Synthesis (TACS), a novel approach to conditional generation on diffusion models. It integrates adaptively controlled plug-and-play "online" guidance into a diffusion model, driving samples toward the desired properties while maintaining validity and stability. A key component of our algorithm is our new type of diffusion sampler, Time Correction Sampler (TCS), which is used to control guidance and ensure that the generated molecules remain on the correct manifold at each reverse step of the diffusion process at the same time. Our proposed method demonstrates significant performance in conditional 3D molecular generation and offers a promising approach towards inverse molecular design, potentially facilitating advancements in drug discovery, materials science, and other related fields.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Thus, we propose LLaMo: Large Language Model-based Molecular graph assistant, which is an end-to-end trained large molecular graph-language model. To bridge the discrepancy between the language and graph modalities, we present the multi-level graph projector that transforms graph representations into graph tokens by abstracting the output representations of each GNN layer and motif representations with the cross-attention mechanism. We also introduce machine-generated molecular graph instruction data to instruction-tune the large molecular graph-language model for general-purpose molecule and language understanding.

The predominant generative modeling paradigm for discrete data is still autoregressive, with more recent alternatives based on diffusion or flow-matching falling short of their impressive performance in continuous data settings, such as image or video generation. In this work, we introduce Fisher-Flow, a novel flow-matching model for discrete data. Fisher-Flow takes a manifestly geometric perspective by considering categorical distributions over discrete data as points residing on a statistical manifold equipped with its natural Riemannian metric: the $\textit{Fisher-Rao metric}$. As a result, we demonstrate discrete data itself can be continuously reparameterised to points on the positive orthant of the $d$-hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^d_+$, which allows us to define flows that map any source distribution to target in a principled manner by transporting mass along (closed-form) geodesics of $\mathbb{S}^d_+$. Furthermore, the learned flows in Fisher-Flow can be further bootstrapped by leveraging Riemannian optimal transport leading to improved training dynamics. We prove that the gradient flow induced by Fisher-Flow is optimal in reducing the forward KL divergence. We evaluate Fisher-Flow on an array of synthetic and diverse real-world benchmarks, including designing DNA Promoter, and DNA Enhancer sequences. Empirically, we find that Fisher-Flow improves over prior diffusion and flow-matching models on these benchmarks.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[ET-Flow: Equivariant Flow-Matching for Molecular Conformer Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22388v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting low-energy molecular conformations given a molecular graph is an important but challenging task in computational drug discovery. Existing state-of-the-art approaches either resort to large scale transformer-based models that diffuse over conformer fields, or use computationally expensive methods to generate initial structures and diffuse over torsion angles. In this work, we introduce Equivariant Transformer Flow (ET-Flow). We showcase that a well-designed flow matching approach with equivariance and harmonic prior alleviates the need for complex internal geometry calculations and large architectures, contrary to the prevailing methods in the field. Our approach results in a straightforward and scalable method that directly operates on all-atom coordinates with minimal assumptions. With the advantages of equivariance and flow matching, ET-Flow significantly increases the precision and physical validity of the generated conformers, while being a lighter model and faster at inference.

| **[Pessimistic Backward Policy for GFlowNets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16012v3)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), which learn to sample objects proportionally to a given reward function through the trajectory of state transitions. In this work, we observe that GFlowNets tend to under-exploit the high-reward objects due to training on insufficient number of trajectories, which may lead to a large gap between the estimated flow and the (known) reward value. In response to this challenge, we propose a pessimistic backward policy for GFlowNets (PBP-GFN), which maximizes the observed flow to align closely with the true reward for the object. We extensively evaluate PBP-GFN across eight benchmarks, including hyper-grid environment, bag generation, structured set generation, molecular generation, and four RNA sequence generation tasks. In particular, PBP-GFN enhances the discovery of high-reward objects, maintains the diversity of the objects, and consistently outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Blurring Diffusion for Hierarchical Molecular Conformer Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20255v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can diffusion models process 3D geometries in a coarse-to-fine manner, akin to our multiscale view of the world? In this paper, we address the question by focusing on a fundamental biochemical problem of generating 3D molecular conformers conditioned on molecular graphs in a multiscale manner. Our approach consists of two hierarchical stages: i) generation of coarse-grained fragment-level 3D structure from the molecular graph, and ii) generation of fine atomic details from the coarse-grained approximated structure while allowing the latter to be adjusted simultaneously. For the challenging second stage, which demands preserving coarse-grained information while ensuring SE(3) equivariance, we introduce a novel generative model termed Equivariant Blurring Diffusion (EBD), which defines a forward process that moves towards the fragment-level coarse-grained structure by blurring the fine atomic details of conformers, and a reverse process that performs the opposite operation using equivariant networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EBD by geometric and chemical comparison to state-of-the-art denoising diffusion models on a benchmark of drug-like molecules. Ablation studies draw insights on the design of EBD by thoroughly analyzing its architecture, which includes the design of the loss function and the data corruption process. Codes are released at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/EBD .</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[SAFE setup for generative molecular design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20232v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SMILES-based molecular generative models have been pivotal in drug design but face challenges in fragment-constrained tasks. To address this, the Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) representation was recently introduced as an alternative that streamlines those tasks. In this study, we investigate the optimal setups for training SAFE generative models, focusing on dataset size, data augmentation through randomization, model architecture, and bond disconnection algorithms. We found that larger, more diverse datasets improve performance, with the LLaMA architecture using Rotary Positional Embedding proving most robust. SAFE-based models also consistently outperform SMILES-based approaches in scaffold decoration and linker design, particularly with BRICS decomposition yielding the best results. These insights highlight key factors that significantly impact the efficacy of SAFE-based generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chemical Language Model Linker: blending text and molecules with modular adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20182v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models and multi-modal models has enabled the appealing idea of generating novel molecules from text descriptions. Generative modeling would shift the paradigm from relying on large-scale chemical screening to find molecules with desired properties to directly generating those molecules. However, multi-modal models combining text and molecules are often trained from scratch, without leveraging existing high-quality pretrained models. That approach consumes more computational resources and prohibits model scaling. In contrast, we propose a lightweight adapter-based strategy named Chemical Language Model Linker (ChemLML). ChemLML blends the two single domain models and obtains conditional molecular generation from text descriptions while still operating in the specialized embedding spaces of the molecular domain. ChemLML can tailor diverse pretrained text models for molecule generation by training relatively few adapter parameters. We find that the choice of molecular representation used within ChemLML, SMILES versus SELFIES, has a strong influence on conditional molecular generation performance. SMILES is often preferable despite not guaranteeing valid molecules. We raise issues in using the large PubChem dataset of molecules and their associated descriptions for evaluating molecule generation and provide a filtered version of the dataset as a generation test set. To demonstrate how ChemLML could be used in practice, we generate candidate protein inhibitors and use docking to assess their quality.</p></details> | 25 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Generative Design of Functional Metal Complexes Utilizing the Internal Knowledge of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18136v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing functional transition metal complexes (TMCs) faces challenges due to the vast search space of metals and ligands, requiring efficient optimization strategies. Traditional genetic algorithms (GAs) are commonly used, employing random mutations and crossovers driven by explicit mathematical objectives to explore this space. Transferring knowledge between different GA tasks, however, is difficult. We integrate large language models (LLMs) into the evolutionary optimization framework (LLM-EO) and apply it in both single- and multi-objective optimization for TMCs. We find that LLM-EO surpasses traditional GAs by leveraging the chemical knowledge of LLMs gained during their extensive pretraining. Remarkably, without supervised fine-tuning, LLMs utilize the full historical data from optimization processes, outperforming those focusing only on top-performing TMCs. LLM-EO successfully identifies eight of the top-20 TMCs with the largest HOMO-LUMO gaps by proposing only 200 candidates out of a 1.37 million TMCs space. Through prompt engineering using natural language, LLM-EO introduces unparalleled flexibility into multi-objective optimizations, thereby circumventing the necessity for intricate mathematical formulations. As generative models, LLMs can suggest new ligands and TMCs with unique properties by merging both internal knowledge and external chemistry data, thus combining the benefits of efficient optimization and molecular generation. With increasing potential of LLMs as pretrained foundational models and new post-training inference strategies, we foresee broad applications of LLM-based evolutionary optimization in chemistry and materials design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved prediction of ligand-protein binding affinities by meta-modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03946v5)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate screening of candidate drug ligands against target proteins through computational approaches is of prime interest to drug development efforts. Such virtual screening depends in part on methods to predict the binding affinity between ligands and proteins. Many computational models for binding affinity prediction have been developed, but with varying results across targets. Given that ensembling or meta-modeling approaches have shown great promise in reducing model-specific biases, we develop a framework to integrate published force-field-based empirical docking and sequence-based deep learning models. In building this framework, we evaluate many combinations of individual base models, training databases, and several meta-modeling approaches. We show that many of our meta-models significantly improve affinity predictions over base models. Our best meta-models achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art deep learning tools exclusively based on 3D structures, while allowing for improved database scalability and flexibility through the explicit inclusion of features such as physicochemical properties or molecular descriptors. We further demonstrate improved generalization capability by our models using a large-scale benchmark of affinity prediction as well as a virtual screening application benchmark. Overall, we demonstrate that diverse modeling approaches can be ensembled together to gain meaningful improvement in binding affinity prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 6 main tables, 6 main figures, 8 supplementary figures, and supporting information.

Current techniques for sampling ensembles are computationally inefficient, or do not transfer to systems outside their training data. We present walk-Jump Accelerated Molecular ensembles with Universal Noise (JAMUN), a step towards the goal of efficiently sampling the Boltzmann distribution of arbitrary proteins. By extending Walk-Jump Sampling to point clouds, JAMUN enables ensemble generation at orders of magnitude faster rates than traditional molecular dynamics or state-of-the-art ML methods. Further, JAMUN is able to predict the stable basins of small peptides that were not seen during training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Guided Multi-Property Molecular Optimization with a Diffusion Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13597v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization (MO) is a crucial stage in drug discovery in which task-oriented generated molecules are optimized to meet practical industrial requirements. Existing mainstream MO approaches primarily utilize external property predictors to guide iterative property optimization. However, learning all molecular samples in the vast chemical space is unrealistic for predictors. As a result, errors and noise are inevitably introduced during property prediction due to the nature of approximation. This leads to discrepancy accumulation, generalization reduction and suboptimal molecular candidates. In this paper, we propose a text-guided multi-property molecular optimization method utilizing transformer-based diffusion language model (TransDLM). TransDLM leverages standardized chemical nomenclature as semantic representations of molecules and implicitly embeds property requirements into textual descriptions, thereby preventing error propagation during diffusion process. Guided by physically and chemically detailed textual descriptions, TransDLM samples and optimizes encoded source molecules, retaining core scaffolds of source molecules and ensuring structural similarities. Moreover, TransDLM enables simultaneous sampling of multiple molecules, making it ideal for scalable, efficient large-scale optimization through distributed computation on web platforms. Furthermore, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in optimizing molecular structural similarity and enhancing chemical properties on the benchmark dataset.

However, while performing well at capturing distributions of molecular motifs, they often produce synthetically inaccessible molecules. To address this, we introduce SynFlowNet, a GFlowNet model whose action space uses chemical reactions and buyable reactants to sequentially build new molecules. By incorporating forward synthesis as an explicit constraint of the generative mechanism, we aim at bridging the gap between in silico molecular generation and real world synthesis capabilities. We evaluate our approach using synthetic accessibility scores and an independent retrosynthesis tool to assess the synthesizability of our compounds, and motivate the choice of GFlowNets through considerable improvement in sample diversity compared to baselines. Additionally, we identify challenges with reaction encodings that can complicate traversal of the MDP in the backward direction. To address this, we introduce various strategies for learning the GFlowNet backward policy and thus demonstrate how additional constraints can be integrated into the GFlowNet MDP framework. This approach enables our model to successfully identify synthesis pathways for previously unseen molecules.</p></details> |  |

| **[It Takes Two to Tango: Directly Optimizing for Constrained Synthesizability in Generative Molecular Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11527v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained synthesizability is an unaddressed challenge in generative molecular design. In particular, designing molecules satisfying multi-parameter optimization objectives, while simultaneously being synthesizable and enforcing the presence of specific commercial building blocks in the synthesis. This is practically important for molecule re-purposing, sustainability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel reward function called TANimoto Group Overlap (TANGO), which uses chemistry principles to transform a sparse reward function into a dense and learnable reward function -- crucial for reinforcement learning. TANGO can augment general-purpose molecular generative models to directly optimize for constrained synthesizability while simultaneously optimizing for other properties relevant to drug discovery using reinforcement learning. Our framework is general and addresses starting-material, intermediate, and divergent synthesis constraints. Contrary to most existing works in the field, we show that incentivizing a general-purpose (without any inductive biases) model is a productive approach to navigating challenging optimization scenarios. We demonstrate this by showing that the trained models explicitly learn a desirable distribution. Our framework is the first generative approach to tackle constrained synthesizability.</p></details> |  |

While recent work has primarily focused on data-driven approaches, the KANO model introduces a novel paradigm by incorporating knowledge-enhanced pre-training. In this work, we expand upon KANO by integrating the large-scale ChEBI knowledge graph, which includes 2,840 functional groups -- significantly more than the original 82 used in KANO. We explore two approaches, Replace and Integrate, to incorporate this extensive knowledge into the KANO framework. Our results demonstrate that including ChEBI leads to improved performance on 9 out of 14 molecular property prediction datasets. This highlights the importance of utilizing a larger and more diverse set of functional groups to enhance molecular representations for property predictions.

Traditionally, watermarking techniques have been developed primarily for rich information media such as images and audio. However, these methods have not been adequately adapted for graph-based data, particularly molecular graphs. Latent 3D graph diffusion(LDM-3DG) is an ascendant approach in the molecular graph generation field. This model effectively manages the complexities of molecular structures, preserving essential symmetries and topological features. We adapt the Gaussian Shading, a proven performance lossless watermarking technique, to the latent graph diffusion domain to protect this sophisticated new technology. Our adaptation simplifies the watermark diffusion process through duplication and padding, making it adaptable and suitable for various message types. We conduct several experiments using the LDM-3DG model on publicly available datasets QM9 and Drugs, to assess the robustness and effectiveness of our technique. Our results demonstrate that the watermarked molecules maintain statistical parity in 9 out of 10 performance metrics compared to the original. Moreover, they exhibit a 100% detection rate and a 99% extraction rate in a 2D decoded pipeline, while also showing robustness against post-editing attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models mostly work with SMILES and SELFIES chemical string representations, which lack spatial features vital for drug discovery. Additionally, attempts to translate chemical 3D structures into text format encounter issues such as excessive length and insufficient atom connectivity information. To address these issues, we introduce nach0-pc, a model combining domain-specific encoder and textual representation to handle spatial arrangement of atoms effectively. Our approach utilizes a molecular point cloud encoder for concise and order-invariant structure representation. We introduce a novel pre-training scheme for molecular point clouds to distillate the knowledge from spatial molecular structures datasets. After fine-tuning within both single-task and multi-task frameworks, nach0-pc demonstrates performance comparable with other diffusion models in terms of generated samples quality across several established spatial molecular generation tasks. Notably, our model is a multi-task approach, in contrast to diffusion models being limited to single tasks. Additionally, it is capable of processing point cloud-related data, which language models are not capable of handling due to memory limitations. These lead to our model having reduced training and inference time while maintaining on par performance.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce a multi-constraint molecular generation large language model, TSMMG, which, akin to a student, incorporates knowledge from various small models and tools, namely, the 'teachers'. To train TSMMG, we construct a large set of text-molecule pairs by extracting molecular knowledge from these 'teachers', enabling it to generate novel molecules that conform to the descriptions through various text prompts. We experimentally show that TSMMG remarkably performs in generating molecules meeting complex, natural language-described property requirements across two-, three-, and four-constraint tasks, with an average molecular validity of over 99% and success ratio of 82.58%, 68.03%, and 67.48%, respectively. The model also exhibits adaptability through zero-shot testing, creating molecules that satisfy combinations of properties that have not been encountered. It can comprehend text inputs with various language styles, extending beyond the confines of outlined prompts, as confirmed through empirical validation. Additionally, the knowledge distillation feature of TSMMG contributes to the continuous enhancement of small models, while the innovative approach to dataset construction effectively addresses the issues of data scarcity and quality, which positions TSMMG as a promising tool in the domains of drug discovery and materials science.</p></details> | 37 pages, 10 figures |

The packing structure of these materials plays a crucial role in determining their electronic and transport properties, which are key to enhancing the efficiency of devices like organic solar cells (OSCs). However, obtaining these optoelectronic properties computationally requires molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to generate a conformational ensemble, a process that can be computationally expensive due to the large system sizes involved. Recent advances have focused on using generative models, particularly flow-based models as Boltzmann generators, to improve the efficiency of MD sampling. In this work, we developed a dual-scale flow matching method that separates training and inference into coarse-grained and all-atom stages and enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of standard flow matching samplers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a dataset of Y6 molecular clusters obtained through MD simulations, and we benchmark its efficiency and accuracy against single-scale flow matching methods.</p></details> |  |

However, proper reasoning based on molecular structural information remains a significant challenge, e.g., even advanced LLMs such as GPT-4o struggle to identify functional groups which are crucial for inferring the molecular property of interest. To address this limitation, we propose StructCoT, a structure-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) that enhances LLMs' understanding of molecular structures by explicitly injecting the key structural features of molecules. Moreover, we introduce two fine-tuning frameworks for adapting the existing LLMs to use our StructCoT. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating StructCoT with our fine-tuning frameworks leads to consistent improvements in both molecular understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging the flexibility of LLMs, our approach allows for intuitive interaction using natural language prompts, providing a more accessible interface for molecular design. Through supervised fine-tuning, G2T-LLM generates valid and coherent chemical structures, addressing common challenges like invalid outputs seen in traditional graph-based methods. While LLMs are computationally intensive, they offer superior generalization and adaptability, enabling the generation of diverse molecular structures with minimal task-specific customization.

| **[Classifier-free graph diffusion for molecular property targeting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17397v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work focuses on the task of property targeting: that is, generating molecules conditioned on target chemical properties to expedite candidate screening for novel drug and materials development. DiGress is a recent diffusion model for molecular graphs whose distinctive feature is allowing property targeting through classifier-based (CB) guidance. While CB guidance may work to generate molecular-like graphs, we hint at the fact that its assumptions apply poorly to the chemical domain. Based on this insight we propose a classifier-free DiGress (FreeGress), which works by directly injecting the conditioning information into the training process. CF guidance is convenient given its less stringent assumptions and since it does not require to train an auxiliary property regressor, thus halving the number of trainable parameters in the model. We empirically show that our model yields up to 79% improvement in Mean Absolute Error with respect to DiGress on property targeting tasks on QM9 and ZINC-250k benchmarks. As an additional contribution, we propose a simple yet powerful approach to improve chemical validity of generated samples, based on the observation that certain chemical properties such as molecular weight correlate with the number of atoms in molecules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ECML PKDD 2024</p></details> |
| **[When Molecular GAN Meets Byte-Pair Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19740v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), are pivotal in discovering novel drug-like candidates via de novo molecular generation. However, traditional character-wise tokenizers often struggle with identifying novel and complex sub-structures in molecular data. In contrast, alternative tokenization methods have demonstrated superior performance. This study introduces a molecular GAN that integrates a byte level byte-pair encoding tokenizer and employs reinforcement learning to enhance de novo molecular generation. Specifically, the generator functions as an actor, producing SMILES strings, while the discriminator acts as a critic, evaluating their quality. Our molecular GAN also integrates innovative reward mechanisms aimed at improving computational efficiency. Experimental results assessing validity, uniqueness, novelty, and diversity, complemented by detailed visualization analysis, robustly demonstrate the effectiveness of our GAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling of Molecular Dynamics Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17808v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful technique for studying microscopic phenomena, but its computational cost has driven significant interest in the development of deep learning-based surrogate models. We introduce generative modeling of molecular trajectories as a paradigm for learning flexible multi-task surrogate models of MD from data. By conditioning on appropriately chosen frames of the trajectory, we show such generative models can be adapted to diverse tasks such as forward simulation, transition path sampling, and trajectory upsampling. By alternatively conditioning on part of the molecular system and inpainting the rest, we also demonstrate the first steps towards dynamics-conditioned molecular design. We validate the full set of these capabilities on tetrapeptide simulations and show that our model can produce reasonable ensembles of protein monomers. Altogether, our work illustrates how generative modeling can unlock value from MD data towards diverse downstream tasks that are not straightforward to address with existing methods or even MD itself.

The use of a discriminator to guide a diffusion process has previously been used for continuous diffusion models, and in this work we derive ways of using a discriminator together with a pretrained generative model in the discrete case. First, we show that using an optimal discriminator will correct the pretrained model and enable exact sampling from the underlying data distribution. Second, to account for the realistic scenario of using a sub-optimal discriminator, we derive a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm which iteratively takes the predictions from the discriminator into account during the generation process. We test these approaches on the task of generating molecular graphs and show how the discriminator improves the generative performance over using only the pretrained model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AISTATS 2024, official proceedings available at https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/ekstrom-kelvinius24a.html.

| **[Mitigating Exposure Bias in Score-Based Generation of Molecular Conformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14014v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular conformation generation poses a significant challenge in the field of computational chemistry. Recently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) are effectively used due to their capacity for generating accurate conformations far beyond conventional physics-based approaches. However, the discrepancy between training and inference rises a critical problem known as the exposure bias. While this issue has been extensively investigated in DPMs, the existence of exposure bias in SGMs and its effective measurement remain unsolved, which hinders the use of compensation methods for SGMs, including ConfGF and Torsional Diffusion as the representatives. In this work, we first propose a method for measuring exposure bias in SGMs used for molecular conformation generation, which confirms the significant existence of exposure bias in these models and measures its value. We design a new compensation algorithm Input Perturbation (IP), which is adapted from a method originally designed for DPMs only. Experimental results show that by introducing IP, SGM-based molecular conformation models can significantly improve both the accuracy and diversity of the generated conformations. Especially by using the IP-enhanced Torsional Diffusion model, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the GEOM-Drugs dataset and are on par on GEOM-QM9. We provide the code publicly at https://github.com/jia-975/torsionalDiff-ip.</p></details> | SMC 2024 |

Existing autoregressive models such as G-SchNet and G-SphereNet for molecules utilize rotationally invariant features to respect the 3D symmetries of molecules. In contrast, Symphony uses message-passing with higher-degree $E(3)$-equivariant features. This allows a novel representation of probability distributions via spherical harmonic signals to efficiently model the 3D geometry of molecules. We show that Symphony is able to accurately generate small molecules from the QM9 dataset, outperforming existing autoregressive models and approaching the performance of diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Despite these advances, several fundamental questions remain unanswered as the field increasingly focuses on more complex generative models and sophisticated molecular representations as an answer to the challenges of drug design. In this paper, we return to the simplest representation of molecules, and investigate overlooked limitations of classical generative approaches, particularly Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and auto-regressive models. We propose a hybrid model in the form of a novel regularizer that leverages the strengths of both to improve validity, conditional generation, and style transfer of molecular sequences. Additionally, we provide an in depth discussion of overlooked assumptions of these models' behaviour.</p></details> |  |
| **[A DNN Biophysics Model with Topological and Electrostatic Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03658v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this project, we provide a deep-learning neural network (DNN) based biophysics model to predict protein properties. The model uses multi-scale and uniform topological and electrostatic features generated with protein structural information and force field, which governs the molecular mechanics. The topological features are generated using the element specified persistent homology (ESPH) while the electrostatic features are fast computed using a Cartesian treecode. These features are uniform in number for proteins with various sizes thus the broadly available protein structure database can be used in training the network. These features are also multi-scale thus the resolution and computational cost can be balanced by the users. The machine learning simulation on over 4000 protein structures shows the efficiency and fidelity of these features in representing the protein structure and force field for the predication of their biophysical properties such as electrostatic solvation energy. Tests on topological or electrostatic features alone and the combination of both showed the optimal performance when both features are used. This model shows its potential as a general tool in assisting biophysical properties and function prediction for the broad biomolecules using data from both theoretical computing and experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Efficiency: Molecular Data Pruning for Enhanced Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01081v1)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of various molecular tasks and massive datasets, how to perform efficient training has become an urgent yet under-explored issue in the area. Data pruning (DP), as an oft-stated approach to saving training burdens, filters out less influential samples to form a coreset for training. However, the increasing reliance on pretrained models for molecular tasks renders traditional in-domain DP methods incompatible. Therefore, we propose a Molecular data Pruning framework for enhanced Generalization (MolPeg), which focuses on the source-free data pruning scenario, where data pruning is applied with pretrained models. By maintaining two models with different updating paces during training, we introduce a novel scoring function to measure the informativeness of samples based on the loss discrepancy. As a plug-and-play framework, MolPeg realizes the perception of both source and target domain and consistently outperforms existing DP methods across four downstream tasks. Remarkably, it can surpass the performance obtained from full-dataset training, even when pruning up to 60-70% of the data on HIV and PCBA dataset. Our work suggests that the discovery of effective data-pruning metrics could provide a viable path to both enhanced efficiency and superior generalization in transfer learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, under review</p></details> |

In this work, we provide a simple algorithm that relies on perturbation experiments on latent codes of a pre-trained generative autoencoder to uncover an attribute graph that is implied by the generative model. We perform perturbation experiments to check for influence of a given latent variable on a subset of attributes. Given this, we show that one can fit an effective graphical model that models a structural equation model between latent codes taken as exogenous variables and attributes taken as observed variables. One interesting aspect is that a single latent variable controls multiple overlapping subsets of attributes unlike conventional approaches that try to impose full independence. Using a pre-trained generative autoencoder trained on a large dataset of small molecules, we demonstrate that the graphical model between various molecular attributes and latent codes learned by our algorithm can be used to predict a specific property for molecules which are drawn from a different distribution. We compare prediction models trained on various feature subsets chosen by simple baselines, as well as existing causal discovery and sparse learning/feature selection methods, with the ones in the derived Markov blanket from our method. Results show empirically that the predictor that relies on our Markov blanket attributes is robust to distribution shifts when transferred or fine-tuned with a few samples from the new distribution, especially when training data is limited.</p></details> | <details><summary>New e...</summary><p>New experiments; reframed contributions</p></details> |

In this work, we propose \emph{Graph Masked Language Models} (GMLM), a novel dual-branch architecture that combines the structural learning of GNNs with the contextual power of pretrained language models. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) a \emph{semantic masking strategy} that leverages graph topology to selectively mask nodes based on their structural importance, and (ii) a \emph{soft masking mechanism} that interpolates between original node features and a learnable mask token, ensuring smoother information flow during training. Extensive experiments on multiple node classification and language understanding benchmarks demonstrate that GMLM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits enhanced robustness and stability. This work underscores the benefits of integrating structured and unstructured data representations for improved graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Graph Neural Networks-based micro-video recommendation has displayed performance improvement for many kinds of recommendation tasks. However, the existing works fail to fully consider the characteristics of micro-videos, such as the high timeliness of news nature micro-video recommendation and sequential interactions of frequently changed interests. In this paper, a novel Multi-aggregator Time-warping Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (MTHGNN) is proposed for personalized news nature micro-video recommendation based on sequential sessions, where characteristics of micro-videos are comprehensively studied, users' preference is mined via multi-aggregator, the temporal and dynamic changes of users' preference are captured, and timeliness is considered. Through the comparison with the state-of-the-arts, the experimental results validate the superiority of our MTHGNN model.</p></details> |  |

We show that floating-point non associativity (FPNA) coupled with asynchronous parallel programming on GPUs is sufficient to result in misclassification, without any perturbation to the input. Additionally, we show this misclassification is particularly significant for inputs close to the decision boundary and that standard adversarial robustness results may be overestimated up to 4.6% when not considering machine-level details. We first study a linear classifier, before focusing on standard Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures and datasets. We present a novel black-box attack using Bayesian optimization to determine external workloads that bias the output of reductions on GPUs and reliably lead to misclassification. Motivated by these results, we present a new learnable permutation (LP) gradient-based approach, to learn floating point operation orderings that lead to misclassifications, making the assumption that any reduction or permutation ordering is possible. This LP approach provides a worst-case estimate in a computationally efficient manner, avoiding the need to run identical experiments tens of thousands of times over a potentially large set of possible GPU states or architectures. Finally, we investigate parallel reduction ordering across different GPU architectures for a reduction under three conditions: (1) executing external background workloads, (2) utilizing multi-GPU virtualization, and (3) applying power capping. Our results demonstrate that parallel reduction ordering varies significantly across architectures under the first two conditions. The results and methods developed here can help to include machine-level considerations into adversarial robustness assessments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at EuroPar 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we explore the advantages of incorporating 3D spatial information through hybrid architectures that combine 3D neural network models with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal modeling, using LiDAR-based point clouds as input. We systematically evaluate four hybrid 3D models, all of which outperform the 2D-only baseline, with the Graph Neural Network (GNN) - RNN model yielding the best results. To reduce reliance on LiDAR, we leverage a pretrained unified model to estimate depth from monocular images, reconstructing pseudo-3D point clouds. We then adapt the GNN-RNN model, originally designed for LiDAR-based point clouds, to work with these pseudo-3D representations, achieving comparable or even superior performance compared to the LiDAR-based model. Additionally, the unified model provides semantic labels for each point, enabling a more structured scene representation. To further optimize graph construction, we introduce an efficient connectivity strategy where connections are predominantly formed between points of the same semantic class, with only 20\% of inter-class connections retained. This targeted approach reduces graph complexity and computational cost while preserving critical spatial relationships. Finally, we validate our approach on the KITTI dataset, achieving a 71% improvement over 2D-only models. Our findings highlight the advantages of 3D spatial information and efficient graph construction for steering estimation, while maintaining the cost-effectiveness of monocular images and avoiding the expense of LiDAR-based systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, GNNs often rely on aggregating information from adjacent nodes, limiting structural information propagation across layers. While codeLMs can supplement GNNs with semantic information, existing integration methods underexplore their collaborative potential. To address these challenges, we propose Vul-LMGNNs, integrating pre-trained codeLMs with GNNs to enable cross-layer propagation of semantic and structural information. Vul-LMGNNs leverage Code Property Graphs (CPGs) to incorporate syntax, control flow, and data dependencies, using gated GNNs for structural extraction. An online knowledge distillation (KD) mechanism allows a student GNN to capture structural information from a trained counterpart via alternating training. Additionally, an "implicit-explicit" joint training framework leverages codeLMs to initialize embeddings and propagate code semantics. In the explicit phase, it performs late fusion via linear interpolation. Evaluations on real-world vulnerability datasets show Vul-LMGNNs outperform 17 state-of-the-art approaches.

However, effective detection of such cases requires node and edge classification methods capable of addressing the unique challenges of transaction graphs, including rich edge features, multigraph structures and temporal dynamics. To tackle these challenges, we propose TeMP-TraG, a novel graph neural network mechanism that incorporates temporal dynamics into message passing. TeMP-TraG prioritises more recent transactions when aggregating node messages, enabling better detection of time-sensitive patterns. We demonstrate that TeMP-TraG improves four state-of-the-art graph neural networks by 6.19% on average. Our results highlight TeMP-TraG as an advancement in leveraging transaction graphs to combat financial crime.</p></details> |  |

The GCN uses shared parameters to effectively represent the characteristics of adjacent entities. We first learn the similarity of entities for node representation learning. By integrating the attributes of the entities and their interactions, this method generates extensive implicit feature vectors for each entity, improving performance in tasks including entity classification and link prediction, outperforming traditional neural network models. To conclude, this work provides crucial methodological support for a range of applications, such as search engines, question-answering systems, recommendation systems, and data integration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ordered Topological Deep Learning: a Network Modeling Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16746v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer networks are the foundation of modern digital infrastructure, facilitating global communication and data exchange. As demand for reliable high-bandwidth connectivity grows, advanced network modeling techniques become increasingly essential to optimize performance and predict network behavior. Traditional modeling methods, such as packet-level simulators and queueing theory, have notable limitations --either being computationally expensive or relying on restrictive assumptions that reduce accuracy. In this context, the deep learning-based RouteNet family of models has recently redefined network modeling by showing an unprecedented cost-performance trade-off. In this work, we revisit RouteNet's sophisticated design and uncover its hidden connection to Topological Deep Learning (TDL), an emerging field that models higher-order interactions beyond standard graph-based methods. We demonstrate that, although originally formulated as a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, RouteNet serves as the first instantiation of a new form of TDL. More specifically, this paper presents OrdGCCN, a novel TDL framework that introduces the notion of ordered neighbors in arbitrary discrete topological spaces, and shows that RouteNet's architecture can be naturally described as an ordered topological neural network. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful real-world application of state-of-the-art TDL principles --which we confirm through extensive testbed experiments--, laying the foundation for the next generation of ordered TDL-driven applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing defense mechanisms, such as watermarking and fingerprinting, suffer from poor real-time performance, susceptibility to evasion, or reliance on post-attack verification, making them inadequate for handling the dynamic characteristics of graph-based MEA variants. To address these limitations, we propose ATOM, a novel real-time MEA detection framework tailored for GNNs. ATOM integrates sequential modeling and reinforcement learning to dynamically detect evolving attack patterns, while leveraging $k$-core embedding to capture the structural properties, enhancing detection precision. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to characterize query behaviors and optimize detection strategies. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ATOM outperforms existing approaches in detection performance, maintaining stable across different time steps, thereby offering a more effective defense mechanism for GMLaaS environments.</p></details> |  |

The RDL paradigm has been successfully applied to recommendation lately, through its most recent representative deep learning architecture namely, ContextGNN. While acknowledging ContextGNN's improved performance on real-world recommendation datasets and tasks, preliminary tests for the more traditional static link prediction task (aka personalized item recommendation) on the popular Amazon Book dataset have demonstrated how ContextGNN has still room for improvement compared to other state-of-the-art GNN-based recommender systems. To this end, with this paper, we integrate ContextGNN within Elliot, a popular framework for reproducibility and benchmarking analyses, counting around 50 state-of-the-art recommendation models from the literature to date. On such basis, we run preliminary experiments on three standard recommendation datasets and against six state-of-the-art GNN-based recommender systems, confirming similar trends to those observed by the authors in their original paper.

| **[Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12318v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language explanations (NLEs) are commonly used to provide plausible free-text explanations of a model's reasoning about its predictions. However, recent work has questioned their faithfulness, as they may not accurately reflect the model's internal reasoning process regarding its predicted answer. In contrast, highlight explanations--input fragments critical for the model's predicted answers--exhibit measurable faithfulness. Building on this foundation, we propose G-Tex, a Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation framework designed to enhance the faithfulness of NLEs. Specifically, highlight explanations are first extracted as faithful cues reflecting the model's reasoning logic toward answer prediction. They are subsequently encoded through a graph neural network layer to guide the NLE generation, which aligns the generated explanations with the model's underlying reasoning toward the predicted answer. Experiments on T5 and BART using three reasoning datasets show that G-Tex improves NLE faithfulness by up to 12.18% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, G-Tex generates NLEs with greater semantic and lexical similarity to human-written ones. Human evaluations show that G-Tex can decrease redundant content and enhance the overall quality of NLEs. Our work presents a novel method for explicitly guiding NLE generation to enhance faithfulness, serving as a foundation for addressing broader criteria in NLE and generated text.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods fail to meet the needs for efficiency, robustness, and accuracy required by large-scale online applications, making this task still challenging. This paper introduces a novel framework that achieves high accuracy and efficient matching while ensuring robustness in handling diverse scenarios. To improve efficiency, we begin by modeling the online map matching problem as an Online Markov Decision Process (OMDP) based on its inherent characteristics. This approach helps efficiently merge historical and real-time data, reducing unnecessary calculations. Next, to enhance robustness, we design a reinforcement learning method, enabling robust handling of real-time data from dynamically changing environments. In particular, we propose a novel model learning process and a comprehensive reward function, allowing the model to make reasonable current matches from a future-oriented perspective, and to continuously update and optimize during the decision-making process based on feedback. Lastly, to address the heterogeneity between trajectories and roads, we design distinct graph structures, facilitating efficient representation learning through graph and recurrent neural networks. To further align trajectory and road data, we introduce contrastive learning to decrease their distance in the latent space, thereby promoting effective integration of the two. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets confirm that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of accuracy, efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGMOD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Predictors in the Presence of Missing and Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01701v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches achieve outstanding predictive performance in modeling modern data, despite the increasing complexity and scale. However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Development of a graph neural network surrogate for travel demand modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07726v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As urban environments grow, the modelling of transportation systems becomes increasingly complex. This paper advances the field of travel demand modelling by introducing advanced Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures as surrogate models, addressing key limitations of previous approaches. Building on prior work with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), we introduce GATv3, a new Graph Attention Network (GAT) variant that mitigates over-smoothing through residual connections, enabling deeper and more expressive architectures. Additionally, we propose a fine-grained classification framework that improves predictive stability while achieving numerical precision comparable to regression, offering a more interpretable and efficient alternative. To enhance model performance, we develop a synthetic data generation strategy, which expands the augmented training dataset without overfitting. Our experiments demonstrate that GATv3 significantly improves classification performance, while the GCN model shows unexpected dominance in fine-grained classification when supplemented with additional training data. The results highlight the advantages of fine-grained classification over regression for travel demand modelling tasks and reveal new challenges in extending GAT-based architectures to complex transport scenarios. Notably, GATv3 appears well-suited for classification-based transportation applications, such as section control and congestion warning systems, which require a higher degree of differentiation among neighboring links. These findings contribute to refining GNN-based surrogates, offering new possibilities for applying GATv3 and fine-grained classification in broader transportation challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Insights into Line Graph Transformation on Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16138v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Line graph transformation has been widely studied in graph theory, where each node in a line graph corresponds to an edge in the original graph. This has inspired a series of graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to transformed line graphs, which have proven effective in various graph representation learning tasks. However, there is limited theoretical study on how line graph transformation affects the expressivity of GNN models. In this study, we focus on two types of graphs known to be challenging to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) tests: Cai-F\"urer-Immerman (CFI) graphs and strongly regular graphs, and show that applying line graph transformation helps exclude these challenging graph properties, thus potentially assist WL tests in distinguishing these graphs. We empirically validate our findings by conducting a series of experiments that compare the accuracy and efficiency of graph isomorphism tests and GNNs on both line-transformed and original graphs across these graph structure types.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, code available at https://github.com/lukeyf/graphs-and-lines</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Local Selection: Global Cut Selection for Enhanced Mixed-Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15847v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed-integer programming (MIP) solvers, cutting planes are essential for Branch-and-Cut (B&C) algorithms as they reduce the search space and accelerate the solving process. Traditional methods rely on hard-coded heuristics for cut plane selection but fail to leverage problem-specific structural features. Recent machine learning approaches use neural networks for cut selection but focus narrowly on the efficiency of single-node within the B&C algorithm, without considering the broader contextual information. To address this, we propose Global Cut Selection (GCS), which uses a bipartite graph to represent the search tree and combines graph neural networks with reinforcement learning to develop cut selection strategies. Unlike prior methods, GCS applies cutting planes across all nodes, incorporating richer contextual information. Experiments show GCS significantly improves solving efficiency for synthetic and large-scale real-world MIPs compared to traditional and learning-based methods.</p></details> |  |

However, most current graph neural network models face the challenge of requiring extensive labeled data, which limits their practical applicability in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. To address this challenge, researchers have explored Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which leverages enhanced graph data and contrastive learning techniques. While promising, existing GCL methods often struggle with effectively capturing both local and global graph structures, and balancing the trade-off between nodelevel and graph-level representations. In this work, we propose Graph Representation Embedding Enhanced via Multidimensional Contrastive Learning (GRE2-MDCL). Our model introduces a novel triple network architecture with a multi-head attention GNN as the core. GRE2-MDCL first globally and locally augments the input graph using SVD and LAGNN techniques. It then constructs a multidimensional contrastive loss, incorporating cross-network, cross-view, and neighbor contrast, to optimize the model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed demonstrate that GRE2-MDCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 82.5%, 72.5%, and 81.6% respectively. Visualizations further show tighter intra-cluster aggregation and clearer inter-cluster boundaries, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework in improving upon baseline GCL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>I am ...</summary><p>I am requesting the withdrawal of my paper due to errors identified in the methodology and experimental results.

Our approach uniquely combines graph-structured scene representation with semantic understanding to determine contextually appropriate object positions. The framework employs GPT-2 to transform categorical node and edge labels into rich semantic embeddings that capture both definitional characteristics and typical spatial contexts, enabling nuanced understanding of object relationships and placement patterns. GraPLUS achieves placement accuracy of 92.1% and an FID score of 28.83 on the OPA dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 8.1% while maintaining competitive visual quality. In human evaluation studies involving 964 samples assessed by 19 participants, our method was preferred in 52.1% of cases, significantly outperforming previous approaches. The framework's key innovations include: (i) leveraging pre-trained scene graph models that transfer knowledge from other domains, (ii) edge-aware graph neural networks that process scene semantics through structured relationships, (iii) a cross-modal attention mechanism that aligns categorical embeddings with enhanced scene features, and (iv) a multiobjective training strategy incorporating semantic consistency constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13773v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates how to schedule nanosatellite tasks more efficiently using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling (ONTS) problem, the goal is to find the optimal schedule for tasks to be carried out in orbit while taking into account Quality-of-Service (QoS) considerations such as priority, minimum and maximum activation events, execution time-frames, periods, and execution windows, as well as constraints on the satellite's power resources and the complexity of energy harvesting and management. The ONTS problem has been approached using conventional mathematical formulations and exact methods, but their applicability to challenging cases of the problem is limited. This study examines the use of GNNs in this context, which has been effectively applied to optimization problems such as the traveling salesman, scheduling, and facility placement problems. More specifically, we investigate whether GNNs can learn the complex structure of the ONTS problem with respect to feasibility and optimality of candidate solutions. Furthermore, we evaluate using GNN-based heuristic solutions to provide better solutions (w.r.t. the objective value) to the ONTS problem and reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show that GNNs are not only able to learn feasibility and optimality for instances of the ONTS problem, but they can generalize to harder instances than those seen during training. Furthermore, the GNN-based heuristics improved the expected objective value of the best solution found under the time limit in 45%, and reduced the expected time to find a feasible solution in 35%, when compared to the SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs) solver in its off-the-shelf configuration</p></details> |  |

This opens up new possibilities for enhancing whole slide image (WSI) prediction tasks with localized gene expression. However, existing methods fail to fully leverage the interactions between different tissue locations, which are crucial for accurate joint prediction. To address this, we introduce MERGE (Multi-faceted hiErarchical gRaph for Gene Expressions), which combines a multi-faceted hierarchical graph construction strategy with graph neural networks (GNN) to improve gene expression predictions from WSIs. By clustering tissue image patches based on both spatial and morphological features, and incorporating intra- and inter-cluster edges, our approach fosters interactions between distant tissue locations during GNN learning. As an additional contribution, we evaluate different data smoothing techniques that are necessary to mitigate artifacts in ST data, often caused by technical imperfections. We advocate for adopting gene-aware smoothing methods that are more biologically justified. Experimental results on gene expression prediction show that our GNN method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Paper: 8 pages, Supplementary Material: 11 pages, Figures: 19</p></details> |

While a large set of works explored the expressivity of MPNNs, i.e., their ability to separate graphs and approximate functions over them, comparatively less attention has been directed toward investigating their generalization abilities, i.e., making meaningful predictions beyond the training data. Here, we systematically review the existing literature on the generalization abilities of MPNNs. We analyze the strengths and limitations of various studies in these domains, providing insights into their methodologies and findings. Furthermore, we identify potential avenues for future research, aiming to deepen our understanding of the generalization abilities of MPNNs.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world environments often exhibit inherent asymmetries arising from factors such as external forces, measurement inaccuracies, or intrinsic system biases. This paper introduces \textit{Partially Equivariant Graph NeUral Networks (PEnGUiN)}, a novel architecture specifically designed to address these challenges. We formally identify and categorize various types of partial equivariance relevant to MARL, including subgroup equivariance, feature-wise equivariance, regional equivariance, and approximate equivariance. We theoretically demonstrate that PEnGUiN is capable of learning both fully equivariant (EGNN) and non-equivariant (GNN) representations within a unified framework. Through extensive experiments on a range of MARL problems incorporating various asymmetries, we empirically validate the efficacy of PEnGUiN. Our results consistently demonstrate that PEnGUiN outperforms both EGNNs and standard GNNs in asymmetric environments, highlighting their potential to improve the robustness and applicability of graph-based MARL algorithms in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The inclusion of distributed message-passing in the GNN architecture makes them ideally suited for distributed control and coordination tasks. Existing results develop GNN-based controllers to address a variety of multi-agent control problems while compensating for modeling uncertainties in the systems. However, these results use GNNs that are pre-trained offline. This paper provides the first result on GNNs with stability-driven online weight updates to address the multi-agent target tracking problem. Specifically, new Lyapunov-based distributed GNN and graph attention network (GAT)-based controllers are developed to adaptively estimate unknown target dynamics and address the second-order target tracking problem. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to guarantee exponential convergence of the target state estimates and agent states to a neighborhood of the target state. Numerical simulations show a 20.8% and 48.1% position tracking error performance improvement by the GNN and GAT architectures over a baseline DNN architecture, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Learning to quantify graph nodes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15267v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network Quantification is the problem of estimating the class proportions in unlabeled subsets of graph nodes. When prior probability shift is at play, this task cannot be effectively addressed by first classifying the nodes and then counting the class predictions. In addition, unlike non-relational quantification on i.i.d. datapoints, Network Quantification demands enhanced flexibility to capture a broad range of connectivity patterns, resilience to the challenge of heterophily, and efficiency to scale to larger networks. To meet these stringent requirements we introduce XNQ, a novel method that synergizes the flexibility and efficiency of the unsupervised node embeddings computed by randomized recursive Graph Neural Networks, with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm that provides a robust quantification-aware adjustment to the output probabilities of a calibrated node classifier. We validate the design choices underpinning our method through comprehensive ablation experiments. In an extensive evaluation, we find that our approach consistently and significantly improves on the best Network Quantification methods to date, thereby setting the new state of the art for this challenging task. Simultaneously, it provides a training speed-up of up to 10x-100x over other graph learning based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Topology Actions for Power Grid Control: A Graph-Based Soft-Label Imitation Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15190v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising proportion of renewable energy in the electricity mix introduces significant operational challenges for power grid operators. Effective power grid management demands adaptive decision-making strategies capable of handling dynamic conditions. With the increase in complexity, more and more Deep Learning (DL) approaches have been proposed to find suitable grid topologies for congestion management. In this work, we contribute to this research by introducing a novel Imitation Learning (IL) approach that leverages soft labels derived from simulated topological action outcomes, thereby capturing multiple viable actions per state. Unlike traditional IL methods that rely on hard labels to enforce a single optimal action, our method constructs soft labels over actions, by leveraging effective actions that prove suitable in resolving grid congestion. To further enhance decision-making, we integrate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to encode the structural properties of power grids, ensuring that the topology-aware representations contribute to better agent performance. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, all of which use only topological actions, as well as feedforward and GNN-based architectures with hard labels. Most notably, it achieves a 17% better performance compared to the greedy expert agent from which the imitation targets were derived.</p></details> |  |

Global change drivers,including climate change or land use modifications, can alter the plant-pollinator interactions. To assert the potential influence of global change drivers on pollination, large-scale interactions, climate and land use data are required. While recent machine learning methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), allow the analysis of such datasets, interpreting their results can be challenging. We explore existing methods for interpreting GNNs in order to highlight the effects of various environmental covariates on pollination network connectivity. A large simulation study is performed to confirm whether these methods can detect the interactive effect between a covariate and a genus of plant on connectivity, and whether the application of debiasing techniques influences the estimation of these effects. An application on the Spipoll dataset, with and without accounting for sampling effects, highlights the potential impact of land use on network connectivity and shows that accounting for sampling effects partially alters the estimation of these effects.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by insights from the Topological Data Analysis (TDA) paradigm, of which real-world data exhibits multi-scale patterns, we construct several graphs using Persistent Homology Filtration -- a mathematical framework describing the multiscale structural properties of data points. Then, we use the constructed graphs as an input to create an ensemble of Graph Neural Networks. The ensemble aggregates the signals from the individual learners via an attention-based routing mechanism, thus systematically encoding the inherent multiscale structures of data. Four different real-world experiments on seismic activity prediction and traffic forecasting (PEMS-BAY, METR-LA) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms single-graph baselines while providing interpretable insights.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study the enhancement of traffic forecasting with pre-training, focusing on spatio-temporal graph methods. While various machine learning methods to solve traffic forecasting problems have been explored and extensively studied, there is a gap of a more contextual approach: studying how relevant non-traffic data can improve prediction performance on traffic forecasting problems. We call this data spatial context. We introduce a novel method of combining road and traffic information through the notion of a traffic quotient graph, a quotient graph formed from road geometry and traffic sensors. We also define a way to encode this relationship in the form of a geometric encoder, pre-trained using contrastive learning methods and enhanced with OpenStreetMap data. We introduce and discuss ways to integrate this geometric encoder with existing graph neural network (GNN)-based traffic forecasting models, using a contrastive pre-training paradigm. We demonstrate the potential for this hybrid model to improve generalisation and performance with zero additional traffic data.

Indoor scenes mainly consist of man-made objects, such as furniture, which often exhibit rectilinear geometry. This property allows indoor scenes to be represented using combinations of polycuboids, providing a compact representation that benefits downstream applications like furniture rearrangement. Our framework takes a noisy point cloud as input and first detects six types of cuboid faces using a transformer network. Then, a graph neural network is used to validate the spatial relationships of the detected faces to form potential polycuboids. Finally, each polycuboid instance is reconstructed by forming a set of boxes based on the aggregated face labels. To train our networks, we introduce a synthetic dataset encompassing a diverse range of cuboid and polycuboid shapes that reflect the characteristics of indoor scenes. Our framework generalizes well to real-world indoor scene datasets, including Replica, ScanNet, and scenes captured with an iPhone. The versatility of our method is demonstrated through practical applications, such as virtual room tours and scene editing.</p></details> | Accepted to 3DV 2025 |
| **[High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263v6)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for theoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</p></details> | 48 pages |

Recent SL prediction methods integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) into graph neural networks (GNNs) and employ attention mechanisms to extract local subgraphs as explanations for target gene pairs. However, attention mechanisms often lack fidelity, typically generate a single explanation per gene pair, and fail to ensure trustworthy high-order structures in their explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diverse Graph Information Bottleneck for Synthetic Lethality (DGIB4SL), a KG-based GNN that generates multiple faithful explanations for the same gene pair and effectively encodes high-order structures. Specifically, we introduce a novel DGIB objective, integrating a Determinant Point Process (DPP) constraint into the standard IB objective, and employ 13 motif-based adjacency matrices to capture high-order structures in gene representations. Experimental results show that DGIB4SL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and provides multiple explanations for SL prediction, revealing diverse biological mechanisms underlying SL inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

Despite its groundbreaking innovation, Vision Graph Neural Network encounters key issues including the quadratic computational complexity caused by its K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) graph construction and the limitation of pairwise relations of normal graphs. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel vision architecture, termed Dilated Vision HyperGraph Neural Network (DVHGNN), which is designed to leverage multi-scale hypergraph to efficiently capture high-order correlations among objects. Specifically, the proposed method tailors Clustering and Dilated HyperGraph Construction (DHGC) to adaptively capture multi-scale dependencies among the data samples. Furthermore, a dynamic hypergraph convolution mechanism is proposed to facilitate adaptive feature exchange and fusion at the hypergraph level. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the benchmark image datasets demonstrate that the proposed DVHGNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art vision backbones. For instance, our DVHGNN-S achieves an impressive top-1 accuracy of 83.1% on ImageNet-1K, surpassing ViG-S by +1.0% and ViHGNN-S by +0.6%.</p></details> |  |

In fact, computational efficiency is the main focus to enhance, whilst we ensure the performance accuracy at the accepted level. Note that Machine Learning (ML) based schemes have a requirement of sufficient labeled data during training, which is not easily satisfied in practical applications. Also, there are unknown data due to new arrived measurements or incompatible smart devices in complex smart grid systems. These problems would be resolved by our proposed GAT based framework, which models the label dependency between the network data and learns object representations such that it could achieve the semi-supervised fault diagnosis. To create the joint label dependency, we develop the graph construction from the raw acquired signals by using CAN. Next, we develop the probabilistic graphical model of Markov random field for graph representation, which supports for the GAT based framework. We then evaluate the proposed framework in the use-case application in smart grid and make a fair comparison to the existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 2025 International Conference on the AI Revolution: Research, Ethics, and Society (AIR-RES 2025)</p></details> |

To this end, the existing methods either focused on the lightweight embeddings for both users and items, or involved on-device systems enjoying the compact embeddings to enhance reusability and reduces space complexity. However, they focus solely on the coarse granularity of embedding, while overlook the fine-grained semantic nuances, to adversarially downgrade the efficacy of meta-embeddings in capturing the intricate relationship over both user and item, consequently resulting into the suboptimal recommendations. In this paper, we aim to study how the meta-embedding can efficiently learn varied grained semantics, together with how the fine-grained meta-embedding can strengthen the representation of coarse-grained meta-embedding. To answer these questions, we develop a novel graph neural networks (GNNs) based recommender where each user and item serves as the node, linked directly to coarse-grained virtual nodes and indirectly to fine-grained virtual nodes, ensuring different grained semantic learning, while disclosing: 1) In contrast to coarse-grained semantics, fine-grained semantics are well captured through sparse meta-embeddings, which adaptively 2) balance the embedding uniqueness and memory constraint. Additionally, the initialization method come up upon SparsePCA, along with a soft thresholding activation function to render the sparseness of the meta-embeddings. We propose a weight bridging update strategy that focuses on matching each coarse-grained meta-embedding with several fine-grained meta-embeddings based on the users/items' semantics. Extensive experiments substantiate our method's superiority over existing baselines.

However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[Sustainable Greenhouse Microclimate Modeling: A Comparative Analysis of Recurrent and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17371v3)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into greenhouses not only optimizes land use but also enhances sustainable agricultural practices by enabling dual benefits of food production and renewable energy generation. However, accurate prediction of internal environmental conditions is crucial to ensure optimal crop growth while maximizing energy production. This study introduces a novel application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to greenhouse microclimate modeling, comparing their performance with traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). While RNNs excel at temporal pattern recognition, they cannot explicitly model the directional relationships between environmental variables. Our STGNN approach addresses this limitation by representing these relationships as directed graphs, enabling the model to capture both environmental dependencies and their directionality. Using high-frequency data collected at 15-minute intervals from a greenhouse in Volos, Greece, we demonstrate that RNNs achieve exceptional accuracy in winter conditions ($R^2 = 0.985$) but show limitations during summer cooling system operation. Though STGNNs currently show lower performance (winter $R^2 = 0.947$), their architecture offers greater potential for integrating additional variables such as PV generation and crop growth indicators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Text Semantics and Graph Structures for Temporal Text-attributed Graphs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14411v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have shown remarkable performance in temporal graph modeling. However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{{Cross}}, a novel framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. The key idea is to employ the advanced large language models (LLMs) to extract the dynamic semantics in text space and then generate expressive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the {Cross} framework, which empowers the LLM to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experimental results on four public datasets and one practical industrial dataset demonstrate {Cross}'s significant effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | Submit to ICML2025 |
| **[A Graph-Enhanced Deep-Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Aircraft Landing Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12617v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) is one of the challenging problems in aircraft transportation and management. The challenge is to schedule the arriving aircraft in a sequence so that the cost and delays are optimized. There are various solution approaches to solving this problem, most of which are based on operations research algorithms and meta-heuristics. Although traditional methods perform better on one or the other factors, there remains a problem of solving real-time rescheduling and computational scalability altogether. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines graph neural networks with actor-critic architectures to address the ALP. This paper introduces three key contributions: A graph-based state representation that efficiently captures temporal and spatial relationships between aircraft, a specialized actor-critic architecture designed to handle multiple competing objectives in landing scheduling, and a runway balance strategy that ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining safety constraints. The results show that the trained algorithm can be tested on different problem sets and the results are competitive to operation research algorithms. The experimental results on standard benchmark data sets demonstrate a 99.95% reduction in computational time compared to Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and 38% higher runway throughput over First Come First Serve (FCFS) approaches. Therefore, the proposed solution is competitive to traditional approaches and achieves substantial advancements. Notably, it does not require retraining, making it particularly suitable for industrial deployment. The frameworks capability to generate solutions within 1 second enables real-time rescheduling, addressing critical requirements of air traffic management.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, submitted to ESWA, comments are welcome</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Infant Language Acquisition Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14341v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the words that a child is going to learn next can be useful for boosting language acquisition, and such predictions have been shown to be possible with both neural network techniques (looking at changes in the vocabulary state over time) and graph model (looking at data pertaining to the relationships between words). However, these models do not fully capture the complexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in isolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for infants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language learning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary acquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during language acquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm selection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models for predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and semantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with a 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some relationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in identifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should subsequently learn than others (such as auditory).</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-Order Graphon Neural Networks: Approximation and Cut Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14338v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph limit models, like graphons for limits of dense graphs, have recently been used to study size transferability of graph neural networks (GNNs). While most literature focuses on message passing GNNs (MPNNs), in this work we attend to the more powerful higher-order GNNs. First, we extend the $k$-WL test for graphons (B\"oker, 2023) to the graphon-signal space and introduce signal-weighted homomorphism densities as a key tool. As an exemplary focus, we generalize Invariant Graph Networks (IGNs) to graphons, proposing Invariant Graphon Networks (IWNs) defined via a subset of the IGN basis corresponding to bounded linear operators. Even with this restricted basis, we show that IWNs of order $k$ are at least as powerful as the $k$-WL test, and we establish universal approximation results for graphon-signals in $L^p$ distances. This significantly extends the prior work of Cai & Wang (2022), showing that IWNs--a subset of their IGN-small--retain effectively the same expressivity as the full IGN basis in the limit. In contrast to their approach, our blueprint of IWNs also aligns better with the geometry of graphon space, for example facilitating comparability to MPNNs. We highlight that, while typical higher-order GNNs are discontinuous w.r.t. cut distance--which causes their lack of convergence and is inherently tied to the definition of $k$-WL--their transferability remains comparable to MPNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 6 figures, ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[VGFL-SA: Vertical Graph Federated Learning Structure Attack Based on Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16793v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained attention for their ability to learn representations from graph data. Due to privacy concerns and conflicts of interest that prevent clients from directly sharing graph data with one another, Vertical Graph Federated Learning (VGFL) frameworks have been developed. Recent studies have shown that VGFL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that degrade performance. However, it is a common problem that client nodes are often unlabeled in the realm of VGFL. Consequently, the existing attacks, which rely on the availability of labeling information to obtain gradients, are inherently constrained in their applicability. This limitation precludes their deployment in practical, real-world environments. To address the above problems, we propose a novel graph adversarial attack against VGFL, referred to as VGFL-SA, to degrade the performance of VGFL by modifying the local clients structure without using labels. Specifically, VGFL-SA uses a contrastive learning method to complete the attack before the local clients are trained. VGFL-SA first accesses the graph structure and node feature information of the poisoned clients, and generates the contrastive views by node-degree-based edge augmentation and feature shuffling augmentation. Then, VGFL-SA uses the shared graph encoder to get the embedding of each view, and the gradients of the adjacency matrices are obtained by the contrastive function. Finally, perturbed edges are generated using gradient modification rules. We validated the performance of VGFL-SA by performing a node classification task on real-world datasets, and the results show that VGFL-SA achieves good attack effectiveness and transferability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Data Selection for Training Genomic Perturbation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14571v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based PerturbSeq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene expression models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Active learning methods are often employed to train these models due to the cost of the genomic experiments required to build the training set. However, poor model initialization in active learning can result in suboptimal early selections, wasting time and valuable resources. While typical active learning mitigates this issue over many iterations, the limited number of experimental cycles in genomic studies exacerbates the risk. To this end, we propose graph-based one-shot data selection methods for training gene expression models. Unlike active learning, one-shot data selection predefines the gene perturbations before training, hence removing the initialization bias. The data selection is motivated by theoretical studies of graph neural network generalization. The criteria are defined over the input graph and are optimized with submodular maximization. We compare them empirically to baselines and active learning methods that are state-of-the-art on this problem. The results demonstrate that graph-based one-shot data selection achieves comparable accuracy while alleviating the aforementioned risks.</p></details> | 19 pages |

These methods typically capture global interests using aggregated past interactions and rely on static embeddings of users and items over extended periods of time. While effective in some domains, these methods fall short in many real-world scenarios, especially in finance, where user interests and item popularity evolve rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel extension to Light Graph Convolutional Network (LightGCN) designed to learn temporal node embeddings that capture dynamic interests. Our approach employs causal convolution to maintain a forward-looking model architecture. By preserving the chronological order of user-item interactions and introducing a dynamic update mechanism for embeddings through a sliding window, the proposed model generates well-timed and contextually relevant recommendations. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from BNP Paribas demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the performance of LightGCN while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of its architecture. Our findings provide new insights into designing graph-based recommender systems in time-sensitive applications, particularly for financial product recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, published in the international conference for AI in Finance (ACM ICAIF'24)</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Critical Phases for Disease Onset with Sparse Haematological Biomarkers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14561v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Routinely collected clinical blood tests are an emerging molecular data source for large-scale biomedical research but inherently feature irregular sampling and informative observation. Traditional approaches rely on imputation, which can distort learning signals and bias predictions while lacking biological interpretability. We propose a novel methodology using Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNAN) to model biomarker trajectories as time-weighted directed graphs, where nodes represent sampling events and edges encode the time delta between events. GNAN's additive structure enables the explicit decomposition of feature and temporal contributions, allowing the detection of critical disease-associated time points. Unlike conventional imputation-based approaches, our method preserves the temporal structure of sparse data without introducing artificial biases and provides inherently interpretable predictions by decomposing contributions from each biomarker and time interval. This makes our model clinically applicable, as well as allowing it to discover biologically meaningful disease signatures.</p></details> |  |
| **[SMPR: A structure-enhanced multimodal drug-disease prediction model for drug repositioning and cold start](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13322v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repositioning drug-disease relationships has always been a hot field of research. However, actual cases of biologically validated drug relocation remain very limited, and existing models have not yet fully utilized the structural information of the drug. Furthermore, most repositioning models are only used to complete the relationship matrix, and their practicality is poor when dealing with drug cold start problems. This paper proposes a structure-enhanced multimodal relationship prediction model (SMRP). SMPR is based on the SMILE structure of the drug, using the Mol2VEC method to generate drug embedded representations, and learn disease embedded representations through heterogeneous network graph neural networks. Ultimately, a drug-disease relationship matrix is constructed. In addition, to reduce the difficulty of users' use, SMPR also provides a cold start interface based on structural similarity based on reposition results to simply and quickly predict drug-related diseases. The repositioning ability and cold start capability of the model are verified from multiple perspectives. While the AUC and ACUPR scores of repositioning reach 99% and 61% respectively, the AUC of cold start achieve 80%. In particular, the cold start Recall indicator can reach more than 70%, which means that SMPR is more sensitive to positive samples. Finally, case analysis is used to verify the practical value of the model and visual analysis directly demonstrates the improvement of the structure to the model. For quick use, we also provide local deployment of the model and package it into an executable program.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Networks Meet Neural Networks: A Survey and Future Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09019v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks (TNs) and neural networks (NNs) are two fundamental data modeling approaches. TNs were introduced to solve the curse of dimensionality in large-scale tensors by converting an exponential number of dimensions to polynomial complexity. As a result, they have attracted significant attention in the fields of quantum physics and machine learning. Meanwhile, NNs have displayed exceptional performance in various applications, e.g., computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics research. Interestingly, although these two types of networks originate from different observations, they are inherently linked through the typical multilinearity structure underlying both TNs and NNs, thereby motivating a significant number of developments regarding combinations of TNs and NNs. In this paper, we refer to these combinations as tensorial neural networks~(TNNs) and present an introduction to TNNs from both data processing and model architecture perspectives. From the data perspective, we explore the capabilities of TNNs in multi-source fusion, multimodal pooling, data compression, multi-task training, and quantum data processing. From the model perspective, we examine TNNs' integration with various architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, Transformers, Large Language Models, and Quantum Neural Networks. Furthermore, this survey also explores methods for improving TNNs, examines flexible toolboxes for implementing TNNs, and documents TNN development while highlighting potential future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey that bridges the connections among NNs and TNs. We provide a curated list of TNNs at https://github.com/tnbar/awesome-tensorial-neural-networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Generative Models Evaluation with Masked Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13271v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, numerous graph generative models (GGMs) have been proposed. However, evaluating these models remains a considerable challenge, primarily due to the difficulty in extracting meaningful graph features that accurately represent real-world graphs. The traditional evaluation techniques, which rely on graph statistical properties like node degree distribution, clustering coefficients, or Laplacian spectrum, overlook node features and lack scalability. There are newly proposed deep learning-based methods employing graph random neural networks or contrastive learning to extract graph features, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional statistical methods, but their experimental results also demonstrate that these methods do not always working well across different metrics. Although there are overlaps among these metrics, they are generally not interchangeable, each evaluating generative models from a different perspective. In this paper, we propose a novel method that leverages graph masked autoencoders to effectively extract graph features for GGM evaluations. We conduct extensive experiments on graphs and empirically demonstrate that our method can be more reliable and effective than previously proposed methods across a number of GGM evaluation metrics, such as "Fr\'echet Distance (FD)" and "MMD Linear". However, no single method stands out consistently across all metrics and datasets. Therefore, this study also aims to raise awareness of the significance and challenges associated with GGM evaluation techniques, especially in light of recent advances in generative models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Finite Element Method (FEM)-based simulations, while accurate, are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time scenarios. Learning-based approaches have shown promise in accelerating predictions but have fallen short in modeling soft-rigid interactions effectively. We introduce MIXPINN, a physics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for mixed-material simulations, explicitly capturing soft-rigid interactions using graph-based augmentations. Our approach integrates Virtual Nodes (VNs) and Virtual Edges (VEs) to enhance rigid body constraint satisfaction while preserving computational efficiency. By leveraging a graph-based representation of biomechanical structures, MIXPINN learns high-fidelity deformations from FEM-generated data and achieves real-time inference with sub-millimeter accuracy. We validate our method in a realistic clinical scenario, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline GNN models and traditional FEM methods. Our results show that MIXPINN reduces computational cost by an order of magnitude while maintaining high physical accuracy, making it a viable solution for real-time surgical simulation and robotic-assisted procedures.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the lEEE IROS 2025 for possible publication</p></details> |

However, finger motions are highly articulated with multiple degrees of freedom, making them significantly harder to model and predict. To address this challenge, we propose a physics-inspired time-agnostic graph neural network (TA-GNN) to accurately predict human finger motions. The proposed encoder comprises a kinematic feature extractor to generate filtered velocity and acceleration and a physics-based encoder that follows linear kinematics. The model is designed to be prediction-time-agnostic so that it can seamlessly provide continuous predictions. The graph-based decoder for learning the topological motion between finger joints is designed to address the higher degree articulation of fingers. We show the superiority of our model performance in virtual reality context. This novel approach enhances finger tracking without additional sensors, enabling predictive interactions such as haptic re-targeting and improving predictive rendering quality.</p></details> |  |

In explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the Shapley Value (SV) is the predominant method to quantify contributions of individual features to a ML model's output. Addressing the limitations of SVs in complex prediction models, Shapley Interactions (SIs) extend the SV to groups of features. In this work, we explain single graph predictions of GNNs with SIs that quantify node contributions and interactions among multiple nodes. By exploiting the GNN architecture, we show that the structure of interactions in node embeddings are preserved for graph prediction. As a result, the exponential complexity of SIs depends only on the receptive fields, i.e. the message-passing ranges determined by the connectivity of the graph and the number of convolutional layers. Based on our theoretical results, we introduce GraphSHAP-IQ, an efficient approach to compute any-order SIs exactly. GraphSHAP-IQ is applicable to popular message passing techniques in conjunction with a linear global pooling and output layer. We showcase that GraphSHAP-IQ substantially reduces the exponential complexity of computing exact SIs on multiple benchmark datasets. Beyond exact computation, we evaluate GraphSHAP-IQ's approximation of SIs on popular GNN architectures and compare with existing baselines. Lastly, we visualize SIs of real-world water distribution networks and molecule structures using a SI-Graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint Version.

| **[GraphEval: A Lightweight Graph-Based LLM Framework for Idea Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12600v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their growing use in evaluating human-generated content, particularly in evaluating research ideas within academic settings. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompt-based LLM methods or fine-tuned lightweight language models for idea evaluation. However, these methods are often unstable and struggle to comprehend the complex semantic information embedded in the ideas, impeding their ability to perform high-quality evaluations. To address the above challenges, we propose GraphEval, a lightweight graph-based LLM framework for idea evaluation. Our insight is that a complex idea can be broken down into comprehensible viewpoint nodes using prompts from small LLMs. These viewpoint nodes can then be linked together through edges created from LLM-based relation extraction and/or BERT similarity scores. The created viewpoint-graph can be used to conveniently propagate scores across view-nodes to improve the robustness of the idea evaluations. In particular, we propose two lightweight graph-based methods for idea evaluation: (1) GraphEval-LP: a training-free label propagation algorithm that propagates evaluation scores from known view-nodes to unknown nodes; (2) GraphEval-GNN: a Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that is trained to predict the evaluation scores given the observed graph with minimal computation resources. Moreover, to overcome LLM's limitation in objectively assessing the novelty of ideas, we further propose a novelty detection model to GraphEval-GNN to enhance its capability in judging idea novelty. Experiments on two datasets show GraphEval improves F1 scores by at least 14% with low computation and API costs. Additionally, GraphEval can effectively detect plagiarized ideas.</p></details> |  |

Although existing methods have shown great performance in generating entire graphs for graph-level learning tasks, no graph diffusion models have been developed to generate synthetic graph structures, that is, synthetic nodes and associated edges within a given graph, for node-level learning tasks. Inspired by the research in the computer vision literature using synthetic data for enhanced performance, we propose Diffusion on Graph (DoG), which generates synthetic graph structures to boost the performance of GNNs. The synthetic graph structures generated by DoG are combined with the original graph to form an augmented graph for the training of node-level learning tasks, such as node classification and graph contrastive learning (GCL). To improve the efficiency of the generation process, a Bi-Level Neighbor Map Decoder (BLND) is introduced in DoG. To mitigate the adverse effect of the noise introduced by the synthetic graph structures, a low-rank regularization method is proposed for the training of graph neural networks (GNNs) on the augmented graphs. Extensive experiments on various graph datasets for semi-supervised node classification and graph contrastive learning have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of DoG with low-rank regularization. The code of DoG is available at https://github.com/Statistical-Deep-Learning/DoG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) 2025</p></details> |

Graph neural networks combined with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which consist of 14,000 to 500 millions parameters, generate features for visual entities (e.g., scene and object types) and identify the entities that contribute to the decision. In this paper, we show that using a simpler combination of transfer learning and a CNN to relate privacy with scene types optimises only 732 parameters while achieving comparable performance to that of graph-based methods. On the contrary, end-to-end training of graph-based methods can mask the contribution of individual components to the classification performance. Furthermore, we show that a high-dimensional feature vector, extracted with CNNs for each visual entity, is unnecessary and complexifies the model. The graph component has also negligible impact on performance, which is driven by fine-tuning the CNN to optimise image features for privacy nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages (13 for the main article, 8 for bibliography, acks, appendixes), 9 figures, 12 tables.

Despite advances in high-throughput sequencing, accurately identifying TFBS remains challenging due to the vast genomic data and complex binding patterns. GCBLANE, a graph-enhanced convolutional bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) attention network, is introduced to address this issue. It integrates convolutional, multi-head attention, and recurrent layers with a graph neural network to detect key features for TFBS prediction. On 690 ENCODE ChIP-Seq datasets, GCBLANE achieved an average AUC of 0.943, and on 165 ENCODE datasets, it reached an AUC of 0.9495, outperforming advanced models that utilize multimodal approaches, including DNA shape information. This result underscores GCBLANE's effectiveness compared to other methods. By combining graph-based learning with sequence analysis, GCBLANE significantly advances TFBS prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMC: Fast Training of GNNs via Subgraph Sampling with Provable Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00924v4)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The message passing-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many real-world applications. However, training GNNs on large-scale graphs suffers from the well-known neighbor explosion problem, i.e., the exponentially increasing dependencies of nodes with the number of message passing layers. Subgraph-wise sampling methods -- a promising class of mini-batch training techniques -- discard messages outside the mini-batches in backward passes to avoid the neighbor explosion problem at the expense of gradient estimation accuracy. This poses significant challenges to their convergence analysis and convergence speeds, which seriously limits their reliable real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel subgraph-wise sampling method with a convergence guarantee, namely Local Message Compensation (LMC). To the best of our knowledge, LMC is the {\it first} subgraph-wise sampling method with provable convergence. The key idea of LMC is to retrieve the discarded messages in backward passes based on a message passing formulation of backward passes. By efficient and effective compensations for the discarded messages in both forward and backward passes, LMC computes accurate mini-batch gradients and thus accelerates convergence. We further show that LMC converges to first-order stationary points of GNNs. Experiments on large-scale benchmark tasks demonstrate that LMC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art subgraph-wise sampling methods in terms of efficiency.</p></details> |  |

To address this, numerous temporal graph neural networks (temporal GNNs) and benchmark datasets have been developed. However, these datasets often feature excessive repeated edges and lack complex sequential dynamics, a key characteristic inherent in many real-world applications such as recommender systems and ``Who-To-Follow'' on social networks. This oversight has led existing methods to inadvertently downplay the importance of learning sequential dynamics, focusing primarily on predicting repeated edges. In this study, we demonstrate that existing methods, such as GraphMixer and DyGFormer, are inherently incapable of learning simple sequential dynamics, such as ``a user who has followed OpenAI and Anthropic is more likely to follow AI at Meta next.'' Motivated by this issue, we introduce the Temporal Graph Benchmark with Sequential Dynamics (TGB-Seq), a new benchmark carefully curated to minimize repeated edges, challenging models to learn sequential dynamics and generalize to unseen edges. TGB-Seq comprises large real-world datasets spanning diverse domains, including e-commerce interactions, movie ratings, business reviews, social networks, citation networks and web link networks. Benchmarking experiments reveal that current methods usually suffer significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs on TGB-Seq, posing new challenges and opportunities for future research.

Recently, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based approach has demonstrated great effectiveness in GAD by first encoding graph data into low-dimensional representations and then identifying anomalies under the guidance of supervised or unsupervised signals. However, existing GNN-based approaches implicitly follow the homophily principle (i.e., the "like attracts like" phenomenon) and fail to learn discriminative embedding for anomalies that connect vast normal nodes. Moreover, such approaches identify anomalies in a unified global perspective but overlook diversified abnormal patterns conditioned on local graph context, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we propose a Multi-hypersphere Heterophilic Graph Learning (MHetGL) framework for unsupervised GAD. Specifically, we first devise a Heterophilic Graph Encoding (HGE) module to learn distinguishable representations for potential anomalies by purifying and augmenting their neighborhood in a fully unsupervised manner. Then, we propose a Multi-Hypersphere Learning (MHL) module to enhance the detection capability for context-dependent anomalies by jointly incorporating critical patterns from both global and local perspectives. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets show that MHetGL outperforms 14 baselines. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/KennyNH/MHetGL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Decomposition of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19723v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNN) exhibit superior performance in graph representation learning, but their inference cost can be high, due to an aggregation operation that can require a memory fetch for a very large number of nodes. This inference cost is the major obstacle to deploying GNN models with \emph{online prediction} to reflect the potentially dynamic node features. To address this, we propose an approach to reduce the number of nodes that are included during aggregation. We achieve this through a sparse decomposition, learning to approximate node representations using a weighted sum of linearly transformed features of a carefully selected subset of nodes within the extended neighbourhood. The approach achieves linear complexity with respect to the average node degree and the number of layers in the graph neural network. We introduce an algorithm to compute the optimal parameters for the sparse decomposition, ensuring an accurate approximation of the original GNN model, and present effective strategies to reduce the training time and improve the learning process. We demonstrate via extensive experiments that our method outperforms other baselines designed for inference speedup, achieving significant accuracy gains with comparable inference times for both node classification and spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Dynamics Models with Generative State Estimation for Cloth Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11999v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulating deformable objects like cloth is challenging due to their complex dynamics, near-infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent self-occlusions, which complicate state estimation and dynamics modeling. Prior work has struggled with robust cloth state estimation, while dynamics models, primarily based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are limited by their locality. Inspired by recent advances in generative models, we hypothesize that these expressive models can effectively capture intricate cloth configurations and deformation patterns from data. Building on this insight, we propose a diffusion-based generative approach for both perception and dynamics modeling. Specifically, we formulate state estimation as reconstructing the full cloth state from sparse RGB-D observations conditioned on a canonical cloth mesh and dynamics modeling as predicting future states given the current state and robot actions. Leveraging a transformer-based diffusion model, our method achieves high-fidelity state reconstruction while reducing long-horizon dynamics prediction errors by an order of magnitude compared to GNN-based approaches. Integrated with model-predictive control (MPC), our framework successfully executes cloth folding on a real robotic system, demonstrating the potential of generative models for manipulation tasks with partial observability and complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the synergistic combination of graph encoding, graph rewiring, and graph attention, by introducing Graph Attention with Stochastic Structures (GRASS), a novel GNN architecture. GRASS utilizes relative random walk probabilities (RRWP) encoding and a novel decomposed variant (D-RRWP) to efficiently capture structural information. It rewires the input graph by superimposing a random regular graph to enhance long-range information propagation. It also employs a novel additive attention mechanism tailored for graph-structured data.

We introduce a novel presence-only SDM with graph neural networks (GNN). In our model, species and locations are treated as two distinct node sets, and the learning task is predicting detection records as the edges that connect locations to species. Using GNN for SDM allows us to model fine-grained interactions between species and the environment. We evaluate the potential of this methodology on the six-region dataset compiled by National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) for benchmarking SDMs. For each of the regions, the heterogeneous GNN model is comparable to or outperforms previously-benchmarked single-species SDMs as well as a feed-forward neural network baseline model.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures, |

They disseminate information through interconnected nodes, but long-range interactions face challenges known as "over-squashing". This survey delves into the challenge of over-squashing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where long-range information dissemination is hindered, impacting tasks reliant on intricate long-distance interactions. It comprehensively explores the causes, consequences, and mitigation strategies for over-squashing. Various methodologies are reviewed, including graph rewiring, novel normalization, spectral analysis, and curvature-based strategies, with a focus on their trade-offs and effectiveness. The survey also discusses the interplay between over-squashing and other GNN limitations, such as over-smoothing, and provides a taxonomy of models designed to address these issues in node and graph-level tasks.

| **[Tensor Convolutional Network for Higher-Order Interaction Prediction in Sparse Tensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11786v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world data, such as recommendation data and temporal graphs, can be represented as incomplete sparse tensors where most entries are unobserved. For such sparse tensors, identifying the top-k higher-order interactions that are most likely to occur among unobserved ones is crucial. Tensor factorization (TF) has gained significant attention in various tensor-based applications, serving as an effective method for finding these top-k potential interactions. However, existing TF methods primarily focus on effectively fusing latent vectors of entities, which limits their expressiveness. Since most entities in sparse tensors have only a few interactions, their latent representations are often insufficiently trained. In this paper, we propose TCN, an accurate and compatible tensor convolutional network that integrates seamlessly with existing TF methods for predicting higher-order interactions. We design a highly effective encoder to generate expressive latent vectors of entities. To achieve this, we propose to (1) construct a graph structure derived from a sparse tensor and (2) develop a relation-aware encoder, TCN, that learns latent representations of entities by leveraging the graph structure. Since TCN complements traditional TF methods, we seamlessly integrate TCN with existing TF methods, enhancing the performance of predicting top-k interactions. Extensive experiments show that TCN integrated with a TF method outperforms competitors, including TF methods and a hyperedge prediction method. Moreover, TCN is broadly compatible with various TF methods and GNNs (Graph Neural Networks), making it a versatile solution.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Recent work suggests that "souping" (combining) individually trained GNNs into a single model can improve performance without increasing compute and memory costs during inference. However, existing souping algorithms are often slow and memory-intensive, which limits their scalability. We introduce Learned Souping for GNNs, a gradient-descent-based souping strategy that substantially reduces time and memory overhead compared to existing methods. Our approach is evaluated across multiple Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets and GNN architectures, achieving up to 1.2% accuracy improvement and 2.1X speedup. Additionally, we propose Partition Learned Souping, a novel partition-based variant of learned souping that significantly reduces memory usage. On the ogbn-products dataset with GraphSAGE, partition learned souping achieves a 24.5X speedup and a 76% memory reduction without compromising accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, accepted to GrAPL 2025 (colocated with IPDPS 2025)</p></details> |

However, optimizing such workflows is costly and inefficient in real-world applications due to extensive invocations of LLMs. To fill this gap, this position paper formulates agentic workflows as computational graphs and advocates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as efficient predictors of agentic workflow performances, avoiding repeated LLM invocations for evaluation. To empirically ground this position, we construct FLORA-Bench, a unified platform for benchmarking GNNs for predicting agentic workflow performances. With extensive experiments, we arrive at the following conclusion: GNNs are simple yet effective predictors. This conclusion supports new applications of GNNs and a novel direction towards automating agentic workflow optimization.

This is a non-Transformer, non-GPT, non-traditional machine learning input-output controlled generative language model. The model is based on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) definition on the directed graph in terms of the neural network, and has the interpretability of all nodes on the graph of the whole model, instead of the traditional machine learning model that only has limited interpretability at the input and output ends. In the language model scenario, the token is defined as a node in the graph. A randomly shaped or user-defined signal flow flows between nodes on the principle of "least resistance" along paths. The next token or node to be predicted or generated is the target of the signal flow. As a language model, BriLLM theoretically supports infinitely long $n$-gram models when the model size is independent of the input and predicted length of the model. The model's working signal flow provides the possibility of recall activation and innate multi-modal support similar to the cognitive patterns of the human brain. At present, we released the first BriLLM version in Chinese, with 4000 tokens, 32-dimensional node width, 16-token long sequence prediction ability, and language model prediction performance comparable to GPT-1. More computing power will help us explore the infinite possibilities depicted above.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastCHGNet: Training one Universal Interatomic Potential to 1.5 Hours with 32 GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20796v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network universal interatomic potentials (GNN-UIPs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization and transfer capabilities in material discovery and property prediction. These models can accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation by several orders of magnitude while maintaining \textit{ab initio} accuracy, making them a promising new paradigm in material simulations. One notable example is Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network (CHGNet), pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic moments from the MPtrj dataset, representing a state-of-the-art GNN-UIP model for charge-informed MD simulations. However, training the CHGNet model is time-consuming(8.3 days on one A100 GPU) for three reasons: (i) requiring multi-layer propagation to reach more distant atom information, (ii) requiring second-order derivatives calculation to finish weights updating and (iii) the implementation of reference CHGNet does not fully leverage the computational capabilities. This paper introduces FastCHGNet, an optimized CHGNet, with three contributions: Firstly, we design innovative Force/Stress Readout modules to decompose Force/Stress prediction. Secondly, we adopt massive optimizations such as kernel fusion, redundancy bypass, etc, to exploit GPU computation power sufficiently. Finally, we extend CHGNet to support multiple GPUs and propose a load-balancing technique to enhance GPU utilization. Numerical results show that FastCHGNet reduces memory footprint by a factor of 3.59. The final training time of FastCHGNet can be decreased to \textbf{1.53 hours} on 32 GPUs without sacrificing model accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, many existing architectures struggle with scalability, relying on a fixed structure tied to a specific number of agents, limiting their applicability to environments with a variable number of entities. While approaches such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and self-attention mechanisms have progressed in addressing these challenges, they have significant limitations as dense GNNs and self-attention mechanisms incur high computational costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agent network and a non-linear mixing network that ensure permutation-equivariance and scalability, allowing them to generalize to environments with various numbers of agents. Our agent network significantly reduces computational complexity, and our scalable hypernetwork enables efficient weight generation for non-linear mixing. Additionally, we introduce curriculum learning to improve training efficiency. Experiments on SMACv2 and Google Research Football (GRF) demonstrate that our approach achieves superior learning performance compared to existing methods. By addressing both permutation-invariance and scalability in MARL, our work provides a more efficient and adaptable framework for cooperative MARL.

Our approach addresses the growing concerns of energy consumption in HPC centers, where electricity expenses constitute a substantial portion of operational costs and have a significant financial impact. TARDIS employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to accurately predict individual job power consumption, then uses these predictions to strategically schedule jobs across multiple HPC facilities based on time-varying electricity prices. The system integrates both temporal scheduling, shifting power-intensive workloads to off-peak hours, and spatial scheduling, distributing jobs across geographically dispersed centers with different pricing schemes. We evaluate TARDIS using trace-based simulations from real HPC workloads, demonstrating cost reductions of up to 18% in temporal optimization scenarios and 10 to 20% in multi-site environments compared to state-of-the-art scheduling approaches, while maintaining comparable system performance and job throughput. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that TARDIS effectively addresses limitations in existing power-aware scheduling approaches by combining accurate power prediction with holistic spatial-temporal optimization, providing a scalable solution for sustainable and cost-efficient HPC operations.</p></details> |  |

Recently, graph prompt learning has emerged as a powerful GNN training paradigm, inspired by advances in language and vision foundation models. Here, a GNN is pre-trained on public data and then adapted to sensitive tasks using lightweight graph prompts. However, using prompts from sensitive data poses privacy risks. In this work, we are the first to investigate these practical risks in graph prompts by instantiating a membership inference attack that reveals significant privacy leakage. We also find that the standard privacy method, DP-SGD, fails to provide practical privacy-utility trade-offs in graph prompt learning, likely due to the small number of sensitive data points used to learn the prompts. As a solution, we propose DP-GPL for differentially private graph prompt learning based on the PATE framework, that generates a graph prompt with differential privacy guarantees. Our evaluation across various graph prompt learning methods, GNN architectures, and pre-training strategies demonstrates that our algorithm achieves high utility at strong privacy, effectively mitigating privacy concerns while preserving the powerful capabilities of prompted GNNs as powerful foundation models in the graph domain.</p></details> |  |

This is especially important for geometric graphs whose properties are equivariance under Euclidean transformations. Current equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs), particularly those using message passing, have a limitation in expressive power. Recent high-order graph neural networks can overcome this limitation, yet they lack equivariance properties, representing a notable drawback in certain applications in chemistry and physical sciences. In this paper, we introduce the Clifford Group Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (CG-EGNNs), a novel EGNN that enhances high-order message passing by integrating high-order local structures in the context of Clifford algebras. As a key benefit of using Clifford algebras, CG-EGNN can learn functions that capture equivariance from positional features. By adopting the high-order message passing mechanism, CG-EGNN gains richer information from neighbors, thus improving model performance. Furthermore, we establish the universality property of the $k$-hop message passing framework, showcasing greater expressive power of CG-EGNNs with additional $k$-hop message passing mechanism. We empirically validate that CG-EGNNs outperform previous methods on various benchmarks including n-body, CMU motion capture, and MD17, highlighting their effectiveness in geometric deep learning.</p></details> |  |

To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 22 figures.

Specifically, we use a graph neural network-based encoder to embed the node features and find the optimal node embeddings by minimizing the worst-case risk through a minimax formulation. Such an uncertainty-aware learning process leads to improved node representations and a more robust graph predictive model that effectively mitigates the impact of uncertainty arising from data noise.

Neural network-based approaches, such as convolutional and graph neural networks, have partially alleviated this burden by enabling efficient local feature extraction. However, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies due to limited receptive fields, and Transformer-based models, while providing global context, incur prohibitive computational costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose AMR-Transformer, an efficient and accurate neural CFD-solving pipeline that integrates a novel adaptive mesh refinement scheme with a Navier-Stokes constraint-aware fast pruning module. This design encourages long-range interactions between simulation cells and facilitates the modeling of global fluid wave patterns, such as turbulence and shockwaves. Experiments show that our approach achieves significant gains in efficiency while preserving critical details, making it suitable for high-resolution physical simulations with long-range dependencies. On CFDBench, PDEBench and a new shockwave dataset, our pipeline demonstrates up to an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy over baseline models. Additionally, compared to ViT, our approach achieves a reduction in FLOPs of up to 60 times.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, primarily based on graph neural networks (GNNs), encounter difficulties in capturing long-term, long-distance, and fine-grained interactions among heterogeneous player nodes, as well as in recognizing interaction patterns. Additionally, they exhibit limited generalization to untrained downstream tasks and zero-shot scenarios. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Propagation Symmetry-Aware Graph Transformer for fine-grained game modeling. This architecture explicitly captures delay effects in the spatial space to enhance player node representations across discrete-time slices, employing symmetry-invariant priors to guide the attention mechanism. We also introduce an efficient contrastive learning strategy to train a Mixture of Tactics Experts module, facilitating differentiated modeling of offensive tactics. By integrating dense training with sparse inference, we achieve a 2.4x improvement in model efficiency. Moreover, the incorporation of Lightweight Graph Grounding for Large Language Models enables robust performance in open-ended downstream tasks and zero-shot scenarios, including novel teams or players. The proposed model, TacticExpert, delineates a vertically integrated large model framework for basketball, unifying pretraining across multiple datasets and downstream prediction tasks. Fine-grained modeling modules significantly enhance spatial-temporal representations, and visualization analyzes confirm the strong interpretability of the model.</p></details> |  |

Historically, motion planners (MPs) have been evaluated with procedurally-generated simulators like CARLA. However, such synthetic benchmarks do not capture real-world multi-agent interactions. nuPlan, a recently released MP benchmark, addresses this limitation by augmenting real-world driving logs with closed-loop simulation logic, effectively turning the fixed dataset into a reactive simulator. We analyze the characteristics of nuPlan's recorded logs and find that each city has its own unique driving behaviors, suggesting that robust planners must adapt to different environments. We learn to model such unique behaviors with BehaviorNet, a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) that predicts reactive agent behaviors using features derived from recently-observed agent histories; intuitively, some aggressive agents may tailgate lead vehicles, while others may not. To model such phenomena, BehaviorNet predicts the parameters of an agent's motion controller rather than directly predicting its spacetime trajectory (as most forecasters do). Finally, we present AdaptiveDriver, a model-predictive control (MPC) based planner that unrolls different world models conditioned on BehaviorNet's predictions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaptiveDriver achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuPlan closed-loop planning benchmark, improving over prior work by 2% on Test-14 Hard R-CLS, and generalizes even when evaluated on never-before-seen cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This project has been accepted to the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025.

However, current staging models are hardly interpretable, and most public datasets contain no clinical reasoning or interpretation beyond image-level labels. In this paper, we present a novel method that integrates graph representation learning with vision-language models (VLMs) to deliver explainable DR diagnosis. Our approach leverages optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images by constructing biologically informed graphs that encode key retinal vascular features such as vessel morphology and spatial connectivity. A graph neural network (GNN) then performs DR staging while integrated gradients highlight critical nodes and edges and their individual features that drive the classification decisions. We collect this graph-based knowledge which attributes the model's prediction to physiological structures and their characteristics. We then transform it into textual descriptions for VLMs. We perform instruction-tuning with these textual descriptions and the corresponding image to train a student VLM. This final agent can classify the disease and explain its decision in a human interpretable way solely based on a single image input. Experimental evaluations on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate that our method not only improves classification accuracy but also offers more clinically interpretable results. An expert study further demonstrates that our method provides more accurate diagnostic explanations and paves the way for precise localization of pathologies in OCTA images.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Econometric discrete choice models aid in studying individual decision-making, where agents select the option with the highest reward from a discrete set of alternatives. Intuitively, the utility an individual derives from a particular choice depends on their personal preferences and characteristics, the attributes of the alternative, and the value their peers assign to that alternative or their previous choices. However, most applications ignore peer influence, and models that do consider peer or network effects often lack the flexibility and predictive performance of recently developed approaches to discrete choice, such as deep learning. We propose a novel graph convolutional neural network architecture to model network effects in discrete choices, achieving higher predictive performance than standard discrete choice models while retaining the interpretability necessary for inference--a quality often lacking in general-purpose deep learning architectures. We evaluate our architecture using revealed commuting choice data, extended with travel times and trip costs for each travel mode for work-related trips in New York City, as well as 2016 U.S. election data aggregated by county, to test its performance on datasets with highly imbalanced classes. Given the interpretability of our models, we can estimate relevant economic metrics, such as the value of travel time savings in New York City. Finally, we compare the predictive performance and behavioral insights from our architecture to those derived from traditional discrete choice and general-purpose deep learning models.</p></details> |  |

As extreme weather events driven by climate change increase, identifying risky FCs becomes crucial for mitigating cascading failures and ensuring grid stability. However, the complexity of the spatio-temporal dependencies among grid components and the exponential growth of the search space with system size pose significant challenges to modeling and risky FC search. To tackle this, we model the search process as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is subsequently solved via a time-varying graph recurrent neural network (GRNN). This approach captures the spatial and temporal structure induced by the system's topology and dynamics, while efficiently summarizing the system's history in the GRNN's latent space, enabling scalable and effective identification of risky FCs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2303.08864</p></details> |

However, as good as GNNs are for learning graph data, they also come with the risk of privacy leakage. For instance, an attacker can run carefully crafted queries on the GNNs and, from the responses, can infer the existence of an edge between a pair of nodes. This attack, dubbed as a "link-stealing" attack, can jeopardize the user's privacy by leaking potentially sensitive information. To protect against this attack, we propose an approach called "$(N)$ode $(A)$ugmentation for $(R)$estricting $(G)$raphs from $(I)$nsinuating their $(S)$tructure" ($NARGIS$) and study its feasibility. $NARGIS$ is focused on reshaping the graph embedding space so that the posterior from the GNN model will still provide utility for the prediction task but will introduce ambiguity for the link-stealing attackers. To this end, $NARGIS$ applies spectral clustering on the given graph to facilitate it being augmented with new nodes -- that have learned features instead of fixed ones. It utilizes tri-level optimization for learning parameters for the GNN model, surrogate attacker model, and our defense model (i.e. learnable node features). We extensively evaluate $NARGIS$ on three benchmark citation datasets over eight knowledge availability settings for the attackers. We also evaluate the model fidelity and defense performance on influence-based link inference attacks. Through our studies, we have figured out the best feature of $NARGIS$ -- its superior fidelity-privacy performance trade-off in a significant number of cases. We also have discovered in which cases the model needs to be improved, and proposed ways to integrate different schemes to make the model more robust against link stealing attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint for the Accepted Work in The 15th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (CODASPY'25)}, 14 pages</p></details> |
| **[A Generative Framework for Predictive Modeling of Multiple Chronic Conditions Using Graph Variational Autoencoder and Bandit-Optimized Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13671v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the emergence of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) is crucial for early intervention and personalized healthcare, as MCC significantly impacts patient outcomes and healthcare costs. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective methods for modeling complex graph data, such as those found in MCC. However, a significant challenge with GNNs is their reliance on an existing graph structure, which is not readily available for MCC. To address this challenge, we propose a novel generative framework for GNNs that constructs a representative underlying graph structure by utilizing the distribution of the data to enhance predictive analytics for MCC. Our framework employs a graph variational autoencoder (GVAE) to capture the complex relationships in patient data. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of individual health trajectories and facilitates the creation of diverse patient stochastic similarity graphs while preserving the original feature set. These variations of patient stochastic similarity graphs, generated from the GVAE decoder, are then processed by a GNN using a novel Laplacian regularization technique to refine the graph structure over time and improves the prediction accuracy of MCC. A contextual Bandit is designed to evaluate the stochastically generated graphs and identify the best-performing graph for the GNN model iteratively until model convergence. We validate the performance of the proposed contextual Bandit algorithm against $\varepsilon$-Greedy and multi-armed Bandit algorithms on a large cohort (n = 1,592) of patients with MCC. These advancements highlight the potential of the proposed approach to transform predictive healthcare analytics, enabling a more personalized and proactive approach to MCC management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics</p></details> |
| **[Post-interactive Multimodal Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09366v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interactions among agents for trajectory prediction of autonomous driving has been challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in agents' behavior. The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of agents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in trajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine Transformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which explicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate coarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in which the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural networks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal Network to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction features are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are sent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed trajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs of the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are learned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory consistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared with the baseline HiVT-64, our model has reduced the prediction errors by 4.4%, 8.4%, 14.4%, 5.7% regarding metrics minADE6, minFDE6, MR6, and brier-minFDE6, respectively.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present Crowdsourced Homophily Ties Based Graph Annotation via Large Language Model (CSA-LLM), a novel approach that combines the strengths of crowdsourced annotations with the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the graph annotation process. CSA-LLM harnesses the structural context of graph data by integrating information from 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors. By emphasizing homophily ties - key connections that signify similarity within the graph - CSA-LLM significantly improves the accuracy of annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that this method enhances the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by delivering more precise and reliable annotations.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose SCOPE-DTI, a unified framework combining a large-scale, balanced semi-inductive human DTI dataset with advanced deep learning modeling. Constructed from 13 public repositories, the SCOPE dataset expands data volume by up to 100-fold compared to common benchmarks such as the Human dataset. The SCOPE model integrates three-dimensional protein and compound representations, graph neural networks, and bilinear attention mechanisms to effectively capture cross domain interaction patterns, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various DTI prediction tasks. Additionally, SCOPE-DTI provides a user-friendly interface and database. We further validate its effectiveness by experimentally identifying anticancer targets of Ginsenoside Rh1. By offering comprehensive data, advanced modeling, and accessible tools, SCOPE-DTI accelerates drug discovery research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural Entropy Guided Unsupervised Graph Out-Of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03241v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emerging of huge amount of unlabeled data, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is vital for ensuring the reliability of graph neural networks (GNNs) by identifying OOD samples from in-distribution (ID) ones during testing, where encountering novel or unknown data is inevitable. Existing methods often suffer from compromised performance due to redundant information in graph structures, which impairs their ability to effectively differentiate between ID and OOD data. To address this challenge, we propose SEGO, an unsupervised framework that integrates structural entropy into OOD detection regarding graph classification. Specifically, within the architecture of contrastive learning, SEGO introduces an anchor view in the form of coding tree by minimizing structural entropy. The obtained coding tree effectively removes redundant information from graphs while preserving essential structural information, enabling the capture of distinct graph patterns between ID and OOD samples. Furthermore, we present a multi-grained contrastive learning scheme at local, global, and tree levels using triplet views, where coding trees with essential information serve as the anchor view. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of SEGO, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in OOD detection. Specifically, our method achieves the best performance on 9 out of 10 dataset pairs, with an average improvement of 3.7\% on OOD detection datasets, significantly surpassing the best competitor by 10.8\% on the FreeSolv/ToxCast dataset pair.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025 (The 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence)</p></details> |
| **[TreeX: Generating Global Graphical GNN Explanations via Critical Subtree Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09051v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for transparency and interpretability in critical domains has driven increased interests in comprehending the explainability of Message-Passing (MP) Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Although substantial research efforts have been made to generate explanations for individual graph instances, identifying global explaining concepts for a GNN still poses great challenges, especially when concepts are desired in a graphical form on the dataset level. While most prior works treat GNNs as black boxes, in this paper, we propose to unbox GNNs by analyzing and extracting critical subtrees incurred by the inner workings of message passing, which correspond to critical subgraphs in the datasets. By aggregating subtrees in an embedding space with an efficient algorithm, which does not require complex subgraph matching or search, we can make intuitive graphical explanations for Message-Passing GNNs on local, class and global levels. We empirically show that our proposed approach not only generates clean subgraph concepts on a dataset level in contrast to existing global explaining methods which generate non-graphical rules (e.g., language or embeddings) as explanations, but it is also capable of providing explanations for individual instances with a comparable or even superior performance as compared to leading local-level GNN explainers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Backdoor Attacks with Reasonable Constraints on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09049v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks against GNNs use fixed-pattern triggers and lack reasonable trigger constraints, overlooking individual graph characteristics and rendering insufficient evasiveness. To tackle the above issues, we propose ABARC, the first Adaptive Backdoor Attack with Reasonable Constraints, applying to both graph-level and node-level tasks in GNNs. For graph-level tasks, we propose a subgraph backdoor attack independent of the graph's topology. It dynamically selects trigger nodes for each target graph and modifies node features with constraints based on graph similarity, feature range, and feature type. For node-level tasks, our attack begins with an analysis of node features, followed by selecting and modifying trigger features, which are then constrained by node similarity, feature range, and feature type. Furthermore, an adaptive edge-pruning mechanism is designed to reduce the impact of neighbors on target nodes, ensuring a high attack success rate (ASR). Experimental results show that even with reasonable constraints for attack evasiveness, our attack achieves a high ASR while incurring a marginal clean accuracy drop (CAD). When combined with the state-of-the-art defense randomized smoothing (RS) method, our attack maintains an ASR over 94%, surpassing existing attacks by more than 7%.</p></details> |  |

Through extensive testing with authentic logistics datasets, the proposed method achieves notable improvements, including a 15% reduction in travel distance, a 20% boost in time efficiency, and a 10% decrease in energy consumption. These findings highlight the algorithm's effectiveness, promoting enhanced performance in intelligent logistics operations.</p></details> | 21 pages |

However, recent studies reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, posing a significant threat to their real-world adoption. Despite initial efforts to defend against specific graph backdoor attacks, there is no work on defending against various types of backdoor attacks where generated triggers have different properties. Hence, we first empirically verify that prediction variance under edge dropping is a crucial indicator for identifying poisoned nodes. With this observation, we propose using random edge dropping to detect backdoors and theoretically show that it can efficiently distinguish poisoned nodes from clean ones. Furthermore, we introduce a novel robust training strategy to efficiently counteract the impact of the triggers. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our framework can effectively identify poisoned nodes, significantly degrade the attack success rate, and maintain clean accuracy when defending against various types of graph backdoor attacks with different properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Quantifying Long-Range Interactions in Graph Machine Learning: a Large Graph Dataset and a Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09008v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-range dependencies are critical for effective graph representation learning, yet most existing datasets focus on small graphs tailored to inductive tasks, offering limited insight into long-range interactions. Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city roads. This dataset features graphs with over $10^5$ nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs using an eccentricity-based approach, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement - particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution - which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.</p></details> | work in progress |

State-of-the-art sequential recommendation algorithms either use graph neural networks to model sessions in a graph or leverage the similarity of sessions by exploiting item features. In this paper, we combine these two approaches and propose a novel method, Graph Convolutional Network Extension (GCNext), which incorporates item features directly into the graph representation via graph convolutional networks. GCNext creates a feature-rich item co-occurrence graph and learns the corresponding item embeddings in an unsupervised manner. We show on three datasets that integrating GCNext into sequential recommendation algorithms significantly boosts the performance of nearest-neighbor methods as well as neural network models. Our flexible extension is easy to incorporate in state-of-the-art methods and increases the MRR@20 by up to 12.79%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at CARS: Workshop on Context-Aware Recommender Systems at the 16th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys) 2022</p></details> |

Specifically, given two graphs that are independent perturbations of a single random geometric graph with sparse binary features, the task is to recover an unknown one-to-one mapping between the vertices of the two graphs. We show under certain conditions on the sparsity and noise level of the feature vectors, a carefully designed two-layer graph neural network can, with high probability, recover the correct mapping between the vertices with the help of the graph structure. Additionally, we prove that our condition on the noise parameter is tight up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we compare the performance of the graph neural network to directly solving an assignment problem using the noisy vertex features and demonstrate that when the noise level is at least constant, this direct matching fails to achieve perfect recovery, whereas the graph neural network can tolerate noise levels growing as fast as a power of the size of the graph. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical studies as well as real-world data experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables; to appear in the Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Topology Reconstruction for Robust Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17281v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become fundamental in semi-supervised learning for graph representation, leveraging their ability to capture complex node relationships. A recent trend in GNN research focuses on adaptive multi-hop structure learning, moving beyond fixed-hop aggregation to more flexible and dynamic neighborhood selection. While GAMLP \citep{Zhang_2022} employs separate MLP layers for each multi-hop domain and ImprovingTE \citep{Yao2023ImprovingTE} enhances this by injecting contextualized substructure information, these methods still rely heavily on predefined sampling strategies, which may limit their ability to generalize and maintain stable accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose an \textbf{adaptive reconstruction framework} that dynamically refines multi-hop structure learning. Inspired by "coreset selection" \citep{guo2022deepcore}, our approach adaptively \textbf{reconstructs} node neighborhoods to optimize message passing, ensuring more \textbf{effective and context-aware information flow} across the graph. To further enhance structural robustness, we introduce two key modules: the \textbf{Distance Recomputator} and the \textbf{Topology Reconstructor} (\textcolor{blue}{DRTR}). The Distance Recomputator \textbf{reassesses and recalibrates} node distances based on adaptive graph properties, leading to \textbf{improved node embeddings} that better reflect latent relationships. Meanwhile, the Topology Reconstructor \textbf{dynamically refines local graph structures}, enabling the model to \textbf{adapt to evolving graph topologies} and mitigate the impact of noise and mislabeled data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our \textbf{adaptive reconstruction framework} achieves \textbf{significant improvements} over existing multi-hop-based models, providing more \textbf{stable and accurate} performance in various graph learning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, manually creating such scenarios in simulation remains a significant and time-consuming challenge. This work introduces a novel method that generates dynamic temporal scene graphs corresponding to diverse traffic scenarios, on-demand, tailored to user-defined preferences, such as AV actions, sets of dynamic agents, and criticality levels. A temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN) model learns to predict relationships between ego-vehicle, agents, and static structures, guided by real-world spatiotemporal interaction patterns and constrained by an ontology that restricts predictions to semantically valid links. Our model consistently outperforms the baselines in accurately generating links corresponding to the requested scenarios. We render the predicted scenarios in simulation to further demonstrate their effectiveness as testing environments for AV agents.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

They encode the image into a graph structure and can be beneficial for efficiently capturing the long-range dependencies typically present in remote sensing imagery. However, an important drawback of these methods is their black-box nature which may hamper their wider usage in critical applications. In this work, we tackle the self-interpretability of the graph-based vision models by proposing our Interpretable Window Vision GNN (i-WiViG) approach, which provides explanations by automatically identifying the relevant subgraphs for the model prediction. This is achieved with window-based image graph processing that constrains the node receptive field to a local image region and by using a self-interpretable graph bottleneck that ranks the importance of the long-range relations between the image regions. We evaluate our approach to remote sensing classification and regression tasks, showing it achieves competitive performance while providing inherent and faithful explanations through the identified relations. Further, the quantitative evaluation reveals that our model reduces the infidelity of post-hoc explanations compared to other Vision GNN models, without sacrificing explanation sparsity.</p></details> |  |

While the expressive power of GNNs has traditionally been examined in the context of graph-level tasks, their potential for node-level tasks, such as node classification, where the goal is to interpolate missing node labels from the observed ones, remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we investigate the proficiency of GNNs for such classifications, which can also be cast as a function interpolation problem. Explicitly, we focus on ascertaining the optimal configuration of weights and layers required for a GNN to successfully interpolate a band-limited function over Euclidean cubes. Our findings highlight a pronounced efficiency in utilizing GNNs to generalize a bandlimited function within an $\varepsilon$-error margin. Remarkably, achieving this task necessitates only $O_d((\log\varepsilon^{-1})^d)$ weights and $O_d((\log\varepsilon^{-1})^d)$ training samples. We explore how this criterion stacks up against the explicit constructions of currently available Neural Networks (NNs) designed for similar tasks. Significantly, our result is obtained by drawing an innovative connection between the GNN structures and classical sampling theorems. In essence, our pioneering work marks a meaningful contribution to the research domain, advancing our understanding of the practical GNN applications.</p></details> |  |

In many applications, it is impossible to observe some properties of the graph directly; instead, noisy and indirect measurements of these properties are available. These scenarios are coined as Graph Inverse Problems (GRIP). In this work, we introduce a framework leveraging GNNs to solve GRIPs. The framework is based on a combination of likelihood and prior terms, which are used to find a solution that fits the data while adhering to learned prior information. Specifically, we propose to combine recent deep learning techniques that were developed for inverse problems, together with GNN architectures, to formulate and solve GRIP. We study our approach on a number of representative problems that demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 (Oral) |

However, our understanding of the critical process of scoring neighbor nodes remains limited, leading to the underperformance of many existing attentive GNNs. In this paper, we unify the scoring functions of current attentive GNNs and propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KAA), which integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture into the scoring process. KAA enhances the performance of scoring functions across the board and can be applied to nearly all existing attentive GNNs. To compare the expressive power of KAA with other scoring functions, we introduce Maximum Ranking Distance (MRD) to quantitatively estimate their upper bounds in ranking errors for node importance. Our analysis reveals that, under limited parameters and constraints on width and depth, both linear transformation-based and MLP-based scoring functions exhibit finite expressive power. In contrast, our proposed KAA, even with a single-layer KAN parameterized by zero-order B-spline functions, demonstrates nearly infinite expressive power. Extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks using various backbone models show that KAA-enhanced scoring functions consistently outperform their original counterparts, achieving performance improvements of over 20% in some cases.</p></details> |  |

Existing $\textit{end-to-end learning}$ methods for MILP generate values for a subset of decision variables and delegate the remaining problem to traditional MILP solvers. However, this approach often fails to guarantee solution feasibility (i.e., satisfying all constraints) due to inaccurate predictions and primarily focuses on binary decision variables. Satisfying all constraints is a prerequisite for obtaining the optimal solution, and the feasibility issue becomes even more critical with non-binary integer (integer, for short) variables. Thus, addressing the feasibility of MILP involving integer variables is crucial. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based solver that not only finds the first feasible solution but also incrementally discovers better feasible solutions without delegating the remainder to off-the-shelf solvers.

However, the limited availability of molecular data raises concerns regarding GNNs' ability to effectively capture the fundamental principles of physics and chemistry, which constrains their generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised approach termed Equivariant Masked Position Prediction (EMPP), grounded in intramolecular potential and force theory. Unlike conventional attribute masking techniques, EMPP formulates a nuanced position prediction task that is more well-defined and enhances the learning of quantum mechanical features. EMPP also bypasses the approximation of the Gaussian mixture distribution commonly used in denoising methods, allowing for more accurate acquisition of physical properties. Experimental results indicate that EMPP significantly enhances performance of advanced molecular architectures, surpassing state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches.

Although Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) efficiently quantifies uncertainty using a Dirichlet distribution over predictive probabilities, existing EDL-based GNN (EGNN) models require modifications to the network architecture and retraining, failing to take advantage of pre-trained models. We propose a plug-and-play framework for uncertainty quantification in GNNs that works with pre-trained models without the need for retraining. Our Evidential Probing Network (EPN) uses a lightweight Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) head to extract evidence from learned representations, allowing efficient integration with various GNN architectures. We further introduce evidence-based regularization techniques, referred to as EPN-reg, to enhance the estimation of epistemic uncertainty with theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed EPN-reg achieves state-of-the-art performance in accurate and efficient uncertainty quantification, making it suitable for real-world deployment.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |

Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

We propose HIS_GCNs, a hierarchical importance graph sampling based learning method. By constructing minibatches using sampled subgraphs, HIS_GCNs gives attention to the importance of both core and periphery nodes/edges in a scale-free training graph. Specifically, it preserves the centrum of the core to most minibatches, which maintains connectivity between periphery nodes, and samples periphery edges without core node interference, in order to keep more long chains composed entirely of low-degree nodes in the same minibatch. HIS_GCNs can maximize the discrete Ricci curvature (i.e., Ollivier-Ricci curvatures) of the edges in a subgraph that enables the preservation of important chains for information propagation, and can achieve a low node embedding variance and a high convergence speed. Diverse experiments on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with node classification tasks confirm superior performance of HIS_GCNs in both accuracy and training time.

These interactions can be effectively represented as time-evolving graphs, where predicting future connections is a key task in applications such as recommendation systems. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have achieved strong results for such predictive tasks but typically require extensive training data, which is often limited in real-world scenarios. One approach to mitigating data scarcity is leveraging pre-trained models from related datasets. However, direct knowledge transfer between TGNNs is challenging due to their reliance on node-specific memory structures, making them inherently difficult to adapt across datasets. To address this, we introduce a novel transfer approach that disentangles node representations from their associated features through a structured bipartite encoding mechanism. This decoupling enables more effective transfer of memory components and other learned inductive patterns from one dataset to another. Empirical evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances TGNN performance in low-data regimes, outperforming non-transfer baselines by up to 56\% and surpassing existing transfer strategies by 36\%</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose GraphGarment, a novel approach that models garment dynamics based on robot control inputs and applies the learned dynamics model to facilitate garment manipulation tasks such as hanging. Specifically, we use graphs to represent the interactions between the robot end-effector and the garment. GraphGarment uses a graph neural network (GNN) to learn a dynamics model that can predict the next garment state given the current state and input action in simulation. To address the substantial sim-to-real gap, we propose a residual model that compensates for garment state prediction errors, thereby improving real-world performance. The garment dynamics model is then applied to a model-based action sampling strategy, where it is utilized to manipulate the garment to a reference pre-hanging configuration for garment-hanging tasks. We conducted four experiments using six types of garments to validate our approach in both simulation and real-world settings. In simulation experiments, GraphGarment achieves better garment state prediction performance, with a prediction error 0.46 cm lower than the best baseline. Our approach also demonstrates improved performance in the garment-hanging simulation experiment with enhancements of 12%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. Moreover, real-world robot experiments confirm the robustness of sim-to-real transfer, with an error increase of 0.17 cm compared to simulation results.

Fires can originate at any point within a structure, and simulating every potential fire scenario is both expensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point (MFSP) and an efficient machine learning framework for its identification. The MFSP is defined as the location at which a fire, if initiated, would cause the most severe detrimental impact on the building's stability, effectively representing the worst-case fire scenario. In our framework, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) serves as an efficient and differentiable agent for conventional Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulators by predicting the Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio (MIDR) under fire, which then guides the training and evaluation of the MFSP predictor. Additionally, we enhance our framework with a novel edge update mechanism and a transfer learning-based training scheme. Evaluations on a large-scale simulation dataset demonstrate the good performance of the proposed framework in identifying the MFSP, offering a transformative tool for optimizing fire safety assessments in structural design. All developed datasets and codes are open-sourced online.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review at Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering</p></details> |
| **[CIMAGE: Exploiting the Conditional Independence in Masked Graph Auto-encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07852v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods encapsulating relational information via masking in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance. However, most existing approaches rely on random masking strategies in either feature or graph space, which may fail to capture task-relevant information fully. We posit that this limitation stems from an inability to achieve minimum redundancy between masked and unmasked components while ensuring maximum relevance of both to potential downstream tasks. Conditional Independence (CI) inherently satisfies the minimum redundancy and maximum relevance criteria, but its application typically requires access to downstream labels. To address this challenge, we introduce CIMAGE, a novel approach that leverages Conditional Independence to guide an effective masking strategy within the latent space. CIMAGE utilizes CI-aware latent factor decomposition to generate two distinct contexts, leveraging high-confidence pseudo-labels derived from unsupervised graph clustering. In this framework, the pretext task involves reconstructing the masked second context solely from the information provided by the first context. Our theoretical analysis further supports the superiority of CIMAGE's novel CI-aware masking method by demonstrating that the learned embedding exhibits approximate linear separability, which enables accurate predictions for the downstream task. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse graph benchmarks illustrate the advantage of CIMAGE, with notably higher average rankings on node classification and link prediction tasks. Notably, our proposed model highlights the under-explored potential of CI in enhancing graph SSL methodologies and offers enriched insights for effective graph representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the WSDM 2025 Oral.

Given the importance of ensuring that published research is methodologically sound and reproducible, in this paper we analyze 10 graph-based RS papers, most of which were published at SIGIR 2022, and assess their impact on subsequent work published in SIGIR 2023. Our analysis reveals several critical points that require attention: (i) the prevalence of bad practices, such as erroneous data splits or information leakage between training and testing data, which call into question the validity of the results; (ii) frequent inconsistencies between the provided artifacts (source code and data) and their descriptions in the paper, causing uncertainty about what is actually being evaluated; and (iii) the preference for new or complex baselines that are weaker compared to simpler ones, creating the impression of continuous improvement even when, particularly for the Amazon-Book dataset, the state-of-the-art has significantly worsened. Due to these issues, we are unable to confirm the claims made in most of the papers we examined and attempted to reproduce.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, the field of graph machine learning is witnessing a paradigm transition from shallow methods to more sophisticated deep learning approaches. The capabilities of foundation models in generalization and adaptation motivate graph machine learning researchers to discuss the potential of developing a new graph learning paradigm. This paradigm envisions models that are pre-trained on extensive graph data and can be adapted for various graph tasks. Despite this burgeoning interest, there is a noticeable lack of clear definitions and systematic analyses pertaining to this new domain. To this end, this article introduces the concept of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), and offers an exhaustive explanation of their key characteristics and underlying technologies. We proceed to classify the existing work related to GFMs into three distinct categories, based on their dependence on graph neural networks and large language models. In addition to providing a thorough review of the current state of GFMs, this article also outlooks potential avenues for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the accepted paper (not the IEEE-published version).

| **[Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization-Aware Network Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE extracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the network. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across four real-world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>AISTA...</summary><p>AISTATS 2025 Camera-ready version</p></details> |
| **[When narrower is better: the narrow width limit of Bayesian parallel branching neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18807v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The infinite width limit of random neural networks is known to result in Neural Networks as Gaussian Process (NNGP) (Lee et al. (2018)), characterized by task-independent kernels. It is widely accepted that larger network widths contribute to improved generalization (Park et al. (2019)). However, this work challenges this notion by investigating the narrow width limit of the Bayesian Parallel Branching Neural Network (BPB-NN), an architecture that resembles neural networks with residual blocks. We demonstrate that when the width of a BPB-NN is significantly smaller compared to the number of training examples, each branch exhibits more robust learning due to a symmetry breaking of branches in kernel renormalization. Surprisingly, the performance of a BPB-NN in the narrow width limit is generally superior to or comparable to that achieved in the wide width limit in bias-limited scenarios. Furthermore, the readout norms of each branch in the narrow width limit are mostly independent of the architectural hyperparameters but generally reflective of the nature of the data. We demonstrate such phenomenon primarily in the branching graph neural networks, where each branch represents a different order of convolutions of the graph; we also extend the results to other more general architectures such as the residual-MLP and demonstrate that the narrow width effect is a general feature of the branching networks. Our results characterize a newly defined narrow-width regime for parallel branching networks in general.</p></details> |  |

Multiple classic classification algorithms were compared, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosting, and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP). The SMOTE algorithm was used to undersample a small number of samples and employed Stratified K-fold Cross Validation. Results: This study included a total of 11,789 participants, including 6,334 females (53.73%) and 5,455 males (46.27%), with an average age of 65 years. Introduction of dynamic causal inference features has significantly improved the performance of almost all models. The area under the ROC curve of each model ranged from 0.78 to 0.83, indicating significant difference (P < 0.01). Among all the models, the Gradient Boosting model demonstrated the highest performance and stability. Model explanation and feature importance analysis generated model interpretation that illustrated significant contributors associated with risks of stroke. Conclusions and Relevance: This study proposes a stroke risk prediction method that combines dynamic causal inference with machine learning models, significantly improving prediction accuracy and revealing key health factors that affect stroke. The research results indicate that dynamic causal inference features have important value in predicting stroke risk, especially in capturing the impact of changes in health status over time on stroke risk. By further optimizing the model and introducing more variables, this study provides theoretical basis and practical guidance for future stroke prevention and intervention strategies.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[GraphEdit: Large Language Models for Graph Structure Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15183v5)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Structure Learning (GSL) focuses on capturing intrinsic dependencies and interactions among nodes in graph-structured data by generating novel graph structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising GSL solutions, utilizing recursive message passing to encode node-wise inter-dependencies. However, many existing GSL methods heavily depend on explicit graph structural information as supervision signals, leaving them susceptible to challenges such as data noise and sparsity. In this work, we propose GraphEdit, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to learn complex node relationships in graph-structured data. By enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through instruction-tuning over graph structures, we aim to overcome the limitations associated with explicit graph structural information and enhance the reliability of graph structure learning. Our approach not only effectively denoises noisy connections but also identifies node-wise dependencies from a global perspective, providing a comprehensive understanding of the graph structure. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of GraphEdit across various settings. We have made our model implementation available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/GraphEdit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Edge of Function: Unraveling the Patterns of Type Recovery in Binary Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07243v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Type recovery is a crucial step in binary code analysis, holding significant importance for reverse engineering and various security applications. Existing works typically simply target type identifiers within binary code and achieve type recovery by analyzing variable characteristics within functions. However, we find that the types in real-world binary programs are more complex and often follow specific distribution patterns. In this paper, to gain a profound understanding of the variable type recovery problem in binary code, we first conduct a comprehensive empirical study. We utilize the TYDA dataset, which includes 163,643 binary programs across four architectures and four compiler optimization options, fully reflecting the complexity and diversity of real-world programs. We carefully study the unique patterns that characterize types and variables in binary code, and also investigate the impact of compiler optimizations on them, yielding many valuable insights. Based on our empirical findings, we propose ByteTR, a framework for recovering variable types in binary code. We decouple the target type set to address the issue of unbalanced type distribution and perform static program analysis to tackle the impact of compiler optimizations on variable storage. In light of the ubiquity of variable propagation across functions observed in our study, ByteTR conducts inter-procedural analysis to trace variable propagation and employs a gated graph neural network to capture long-range data flow dependencies for variable type recovery. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of ByteTR. The results demonstrate that ByteTR leads state-of-the-art works in both effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, in real CTF challenge case, the pseudo code optimized by ByteTR significantly improves readability, surpassing leading tools IDA and Ghidra.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Analytics-Driven Approach to Enhancing Supply Chain Visibility with Graph Neural Networks and Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07231v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In today's globalised trade, supply chains form complex networks spanning multiple organisations and even countries, making them highly vulnerable to disruptions. These vulnerabilities, highlighted by recent global crises, underscore the urgent need for improved visibility and resilience of the supply chain. However, data-sharing limitations often hinder the achievement of comprehensive visibility between organisations or countries due to privacy, security, and regulatory concerns. Moreover, most existing research studies focused on individual firm- or product-level networks, overlooking the multifaceted interactions among diverse entities that characterise real-world supply chains, thus limiting a holistic understanding of supply chain dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) to enhance supply chain visibility through relationship prediction in supply chain knowledge graphs. FL enables collaborative model training across countries by facilitating information sharing without requiring raw data exchange, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and maintaining data security. GCNs empower the framework to capture intricate relational patterns within knowledge graphs, enabling accurate link prediction to uncover hidden connections and provide comprehensive insights into supply chain networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict relationships within country-level supply chain knowledge graphs. This enhanced visibility supports actionable insights, facilitates proactive risk management, and contributes to the development of resilient and adaptive supply chain strategies, ensuring that supply chains are better equipped to navigate the complexities of the global economy.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, submitted to a journal</p></details> |

However, the necessity of explicit graph structures remains underexamined, as existing evaluations conflate preprocessing with architectural contributions. To isolate the true value of GNNs, we propose DiagMLP, a deliberately minimal, topology-agnostic baseline that retains multimodal fusion capabilities while excluding graph modeling. Through ablation experiments across five datasets, DiagMLP achieves performance parity with state-of-the-art GNN-based methods in fault detection, localization, and classification. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that graph structures are indispensable, revealing that: (i) preprocessing pipelines already encode critical dependency information, and (ii) GNN modules contribute marginally beyond multimodality fusion. Our work advocates for systematic re-evaluation of architectural complexity and highlights the need for standardized baseline protocols to validate model innovations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, submitted to conference</p></details> |

While existing security solutions, including AI-based approaches, offer promise, their lack of transparency constraints the understanding of detected threats. Manual analysis remains time-consuming and reliant on scarce expertise. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called XAIDroid that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) and graph attention mechanisms for automatically locating malicious code snippets within malware. By representing code as API call graphs, XAIDroid captures semantic context and enhances resilience against obfuscation. Utilizing the Graph Attention Model (GAM) and Graph Attention Network (GAT), we assign importance scores to API nodes, facilitating focused attention on critical information for malicious code localization. Evaluation on synthetic and real-world malware datasets demonstrates the efficacy of our approach, achieving high recall and F1-score rates for malicious code localization. The successful implementation of automatic malicious code localization enhances the scalability, interpretability, and reliability of malware analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has 13 pages and contains 5 images (3 figures within the paper and 2 author photos).

| **[Neural Snowflakes: Universal Latent Graph Inference via Trainable Latent Geometries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15003v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inductive bias of a graph neural network (GNN) is largely encoded in its specified graph. Latent graph inference relies on latent geometric representations to dynamically rewire or infer a GNN's graph to maximize the GNN's predictive downstream performance, but it lacks solid theoretical foundations in terms of embedding-based representation guarantees. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a trainable deep learning architecture, coined neural snowflake, that can adaptively implement fractal-like metrics on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that any given finite weights graph can be isometrically embedded by a standard MLP encoder. Furthermore, when the latent graph can be represented in the feature space of a sufficiently regular kernel, we show that the combined neural snowflake and MLP encoder do not succumb to the curse of dimensionality by using only a low-degree polynomial number of parameters in the number of nodes. This implementation enables a low-dimensional isometric embedding of the latent graph. We conduct synthetic experiments to demonstrate the superior metric learning capabilities of neural snowflakes when compared to more familiar spaces like Euclidean space. Additionally, we carry out latent graph inference experiments on graph benchmarks. Consistently, the neural snowflake model achieves predictive performance that either matches or surpasses that of the state-of-the-art latent graph inference models. Importantly, this performance improvement is achieved without requiring random search for optimal latent geometry. Instead, the neural snowflake model achieves this enhancement in a differentiable manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages + Appendix, 2 Figures, 9 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Deep Cut-informed Graph Embedding and Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06635v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph clustering aims to divide the graph into different clusters. The recently emerging deep graph clustering approaches are largely built on graph neural networks (GNN). However, GNN is designed for general graph encoding and there is a common issue of representation collapse in existing GNN-based deep graph clustering algorithms. We attribute two main reasons for such issue: (i) the inductive bias of GNN models: GNNs tend to generate similar representations for proximal nodes. Since graphs often contain a non-negligible amount of inter-cluster links, the bias results in error message passing and leads to biased clustering; (ii) the clustering guided loss function: most traditional approaches strive to make all samples closer to pre-learned cluster centers, which cause a degenerate solution assigning all data points to a single label thus make all samples and less discriminative. To address these challenges, we investigate graph clustering from a graph cut perspective and propose an innovative and non-GNN-based Deep Cut-informed Graph embedding and Clustering framework, namely DCGC. This framework includes two modules: (i) cut-informed graph encoding; (ii) self-supervised graph clustering via optimal transport. For the encoding module, we derive a cut-informed graph embedding objective to fuse graph structure and attributes by minimizing their joint normalized cut. For the clustering module, we utilize the optimal transport theory to obtain the clustering assignments, which can balance the guidance of proximity to the pre-learned cluster center. With the above two tailored designs, DCGC is more suitable for the graph clustering task, which can effectively alleviate the problem of representation collapse and achieve better performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method is simple but effective compared with benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Such data often comes in the form of time-series signals, based on which real-time predictions can be made locally using an AI model. However, a hardware-software approach capable of making low-latency predictions with low power consumption is required. In this paper, we present a hardware implementation of an event-graph neural network for time-series classification. We leverage an artificial cochlea model to convert the input time-series signals into a sparse event-data format that allows the event-graph to drastically reduce the number of calculations relative to other AI methods. We implemented the design on a SoC FPGA and applied it to the real-time processing of the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset to benchmark our approach against competitive solutions. Our method achieves a floating-point accuracy of 92.7% on the SHD dataset for the base model, which is only 2.4% and 2% less than the state-of-the-art models with over 10% and 67% fewer model parameters, respectively. It also outperforms FPGA-based spiking neural network implementations by 19.3% and 4.5%, achieving 92.3% accuracy for the quantised model while using fewer computational resources and reducing latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for the 21st International Symposium on Applied Reconfigurable Computing ARC 2025, Sevilla, Spain, April 9-11, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Using Subgraph GNNs for Node Classification:an Overlooked Potential Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06614v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the strong performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in node classification. However, most existing GNNs adopt a node-centric perspective and rely on global message passing, leading to high computational and memory costs that hinder scalability. To mitigate these challenges, subgraph-based methods have been introduced, leveraging local subgraphs as approximations of full computational trees. While this approach improves efficiency, it often suffers from performance degradation due to the loss of global contextual information, limiting its effectiveness compared to global GNNs. To address this trade-off between scalability and classification accuracy, we reformulate the node classification task as a subgraph classification problem and propose SubGND (Subgraph GNN for NoDe). This framework introduces a differentiated zero-padding strategy and an Ego-Alter subgraph representation method to resolve label conflicts while incorporating an Adaptive Feature Scaling Mechanism to dynamically adjust feature contributions based on dataset-specific dependencies. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that SubGND achieves performance comparable to or surpassing global message-passing GNNs, particularly in heterophilic settings, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability as a promising solution for node classification.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Improving Graph Neural Networks on Multi-node Tasks with the Labeling Trick](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10074v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study using graph neural networks (GNNs) for \textit{multi-node representation learning}, where a representation for a set of more than one node (such as a link) is to be learned. Existing GNNs are mainly designed to learn single-node representations. When used for multi-node representation learning, a common practice is to directly aggregate the single-node representations obtained by a GNN. In this paper, we show a fundamental limitation of such an approach, namely the inability to capture the dependence among multiple nodes in the node set. A straightforward solution is to distinguish target nodes from others. Formalizing this idea, we propose \text{labeling trick}, which first labels nodes in the graph according to their relationships with the target node set before applying a GNN and then aggregates node representations obtained in the labeled graph for multi-node representations. Besides node sets in graphs, we also extend labeling tricks to posets, subsets and hypergraphs. Experiments verify that the labeling trick technique can boost GNNs on various tasks, including undirected link prediction, directed link prediction, hyperedge prediction, and subgraph prediction. Our work explains the superior performance of previous node-labeling-based methods and establishes a theoretical foundation for using GNNs for multi-node representation learning.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches tend to use graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the momentum spillover effect of risks. However, due to the black-box nature of GNNs, these methods leave much to be improved for precise and reliable explanations towards company risks. In this paper, we propose CF3, a novel Counterfactual and Factual learning method for company Financial risk detection, which generates evidence subgraphs on company knowledge graphs to reliably detect and explain company financial risks. Specifically, we first propose a meta-path attribution process based on Granger causality, selecting the meta-paths most relevant to the target node labels to construct an attribution subgraph. Subsequently, we propose anedge-type-aware graph generator to identify important edges, and we also devise a layer-based feature masker to recognize crucial node features. Finally, we utilize counterfactual-factual reasoning and a loss function based on attribution subgraphs to jointly guide the learning of the graph generator and feature masker. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in the field of financial risk detection.</p></details> |  |

However, current GCL models face challenges with computational demands and limited feature utilization, often relying only on basic graph properties like node degrees and edge attributes. This constrains their capacity to fully capture the complex topological characteristics of real-world phenomena represented by graphs. To address these limitations, we propose Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning (TensorMV-GCL), a novel framework that integrates extended persistent homology (EPH) with GCL representations and facilitates multi-scale feature extraction. Our approach uniquely employs tensor aggregation and compression to fuse information from graph and topological features obtained from multiple augmented views of the same graph. By incorporating tensor concatenation and contraction modules, we reduce computational overhead by separating feature tensor aggregation and transformation. Furthermore, we enhance the quality of learned topological features and model robustness through noise-injected EPH. Experiments on molecular, bioinformatic, and social network datasets demonstrate TensorMV-GCL's superiority, outperforming 15 state-of-the-art methods in graph classification tasks across 9 out of 11 benchmarks while achieving comparable results on the remaining two.

The proposed framework integrates a pre-trained graph neural network to predict demand elasticity and inform pricing decisions. The spatio-temporal EV charging demand prediction (EVCDP) dataset from Shenzhen is utilized to capture the geographic and temporal characteristics of the charging stations. The RL model dynamically adjusts prices at individual stations based on occupancy, maximum station capacity, and demand forecasts, ensuring an equitable network load distribution while preventing station overloads. By leveraging spatially-aware demand predictions and a carefully designed reward function, the framework achieves efficient load balancing and adaptive pricing strategies that respond to localized demand and global network dynamics, ensuring improved network stability and user satisfaction. The efficacy of the approach is validated through simulations on the dataset, showing significant improvements in load balancing and reduced overload as the RL agent iteratively interacts with the environment and learns to dynamically adjust pricing strategies based on real-time demand patterns and station constraints. The findings highlight the potential of adaptive pricing and load-balancing strategies to address the complexities of EV infrastructure, paving the way for scalable and user-centric solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>19th ...</summary><p>19th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon 2025)</p></details> |

Model-level interpretations explain what patterns maximize probability of predicting to a certain class. However, existing model-level interpretation methods pose several limitations such as generating invalid explanation graphs and requiring extreme fine-tuning on hyperparameters manually. In this paper, we propose a new Generative Interpretation Network for Model-Level Explanation of Graph Neural Networks (GIN-Graph), to generate reliable model-level explanation graphs. The implicit and likelihood-free generative adversarial networks are exploited to construct explanation graphs similar to original graphs, meanwhile maximizing the prediction probability for a certain class by adopting a novel objective function. Experimental results indicate that GIN-Graph can be easily applied to GNN models trained on a variety of graph datasets to create meaningful explanation graphs without requiring extensive fine-tuning on hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |

Agents cache the most recent samples from others and communicate over wireless collision channels governed by an underlying graph topology. Our goal is to minimize time-average estimation error and/or age of information with decentralized scalable sampling and transmission policies, considering both oblivious (where decision-making is independent of the physical processes) and non-oblivious policies (where decision-making depends on physical processes). We prove that in oblivious policies, minimizing estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the age of information. The complexity of the problem, especially the multi-dimensional action spaces and arbitrary network topologies, makes theoretical methods for finding optimal transmission policies intractable. We optimize the policies using a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where each agent employs a permutation-equivariant graph neural network architecture. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed framework exhibits desirable transferability properties, allowing transmission policies trained on small- or moderate-size networks to be executed effectively on large-scale topologies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) The trained policies are transferable to larger networks, and their performance gains increase with the number of agents; (iii) The training procedure withstands non-stationarity even if we utilize independent learning techniques; and, (iv) Recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity in independent learning.</p></details> |  |

The central aim of this study is to enhance feature extraction and classification performance by utilizing multiscale object-based image analysis (OBIA). Traditional pixel-based methods often suffer from low accuracy and speckle noise, while single-scale OBIA approaches may overlook crucial information of image objects at different levels of detail. MOB-GCN addresses this issue by extracting and integrating features from multiple segmentation scales to improve classification results using the Multiresolution Graph Network (MGN) architecture that can model fine-grained and global spatial patterns. By constructing a dynamic multiscale graph hierarchy, MOB-GCN offers a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate details and global context of HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that MOB-GCN consistently outperforms single-scale graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in terms of classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and noise reduction, particularly when labeled data is limited. The implementation of MOB-GCN is publicly available at https://github.com/HySonLab/MultiscaleHSI</p></details> |  |

However, the rapid increase in the scale of graph data has introduced significant performance bottlenecks for GNN inference. Both computational complexity and memory usage have risen dramatically, with memory becoming a critical limitation. Although graph sampling-based subgraph learning methods can help mitigate computational and memory demands, they come with drawbacks such as information loss and high redundant computation among subgraphs. This paper introduces an innovative processing paradgim for distributed graph learning that abstracts GNNs with a new set of programming interfaces and leverages Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation technology to its full potential. This paradigm enables GNNs to highly exploit the computational resources of distributed clusters by eliminating the drawbacks of subgraph learning methods, leading to a more efficient inference process. Our experimental results demonstrate that on industry-scale graphs of up to \textbf{500 million nodes and 22.4 billion edges}, our method can produce a performance boost of up to \textbf{27.4 times}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EuroSys 2025 (poster)</p></details> |

We present a novel framework HIPPO-MAT that integrates graph neural networks (GNN) employing a GraphSAGE architecture to compute independent embeddings on each agent with an Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) approach for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. In our system, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) share aggregated observation data via communication channels while independently processing these inputs to generate enriched state embeddings. This design enables dynamic, cost-optimal, conflict-aware task allocation in a 3D grid environment without the need for centralized coordination. A modified A* path planner is incorporated for efficient routing and collision avoidance. Simulation experiments demonstrate scalability with up to 30 agents and preliminary real-world validation on JetBot ROS AI Robots, each running its model on a Jetson Nano and communicating through an ESP-NOW protocol using ESP32-S3, which confirms the practical viability of the approach that incorporates simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Experimental results revealed that our method achieves a high 92.5% conflict-free success rate, with only a 16.49% performance gap compared to the centralized Hungarian method, while outperforming the heuristic decentralized baseline based on greedy approach. Additionally, the framework exhibits scalability with up to 30 agents with allocation processing of 0.32 simulation step time and robustness in responding to dynamically generated tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.02311</p></details> |

However, existing methods, which typically rely on single experiments, often reach a performance bottleneck and face limitations in handling diverse interference structures. In contrast, we propose leveraging multiple experiments to overcome these limitations. In industry, the use of sequential experiments, often known as the ramp-up process, where traffic to the treatment gradually increases, is common due to operational needs like risk management and cost control. Our approach shifts the focus from operational aspects to the statistical advantages of merging data from multiple experiments. By combining data from sequentially conducted experiments, we aim to estimate the global average treatment effect more effectively. In this paper, we begin by analyzing the bias and variance of the linear regression estimator for GATE under general linear network interference. We demonstrate that bias plays a dominant role in the bias-variance tradeoff and highlight the intrinsic bias reduction achieved by merging data from experiments with strictly different treatment proportions. Herein the improvement introduced by merging two steps of experimental data is essential. In addition, we show that merging more steps of experimental data is unnecessary under general linear interference, while it can become beneficial when nonlinear interference occurs. Furthermore, we look into a more advanced estimator based on graph neural networks. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that the regression-based estimator benefits remarkably from training on merged experiment data, achieving outstanding statistical performance.</p></details> |  |

These models are characterized by their simplicity, good experimental results and computational efficiency. However, their theoretical expressive power still remains unclear, restricting a deeper understanding of the potential of such models. In this work, we concentrate on characterizing the theoretical expressiveness of a wide range of invariant models under fully-connected conditions. We first rigorously characterize the expressiveness of the most classic invariant model, message-passing neural networks incorporating distance (DisGNN), restricting its unidentifiable cases to be only highly symmetric point clouds. We then prove that GeoNGNN, the geometric counterpart of one of the simplest subgraph graph neural networks, can effectively break these corner cases' symmetry and thus achieve E(3)-completeness. By leveraging GeoNGNN as a theoretical tool, we further prove that: 1) most subgraph GNNs developed in traditional graph learning can be seamlessly extended to geometric scenarios with E(3)-completeness; 2) DimeNet, GemNet and SphereNet, three well-established invariant models, are also all capable of achieving E(3)-completeness. Our theoretical results fill the gap in the expressive power of invariant models, contributing to a rigorous and comprehensive understanding of their capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations</p></details> |

In our study, we reveal a critical yet underexplored consequence of integrating attention into edge-featured GNNs: the emergence of Massive Activations (MAs) within attention layers. By developing a novel method for detecting MAs on edge features, we show that these extreme activations are not only activation anomalies but encode domain-relevant signals. Our post-hoc interpretability analysis demonstrates that, in molecular graphs, MAs aggregate predominantly on common bond types (e.g., single and double bonds) while sparing more informative ones (e.g., triple bonds). Furthermore, our ablation studies confirm that MAs can serve as natural attribution indicators, reallocating to less informative edges. Our study assesses various edge-featured attention-based GNN models using benchmark datasets, including ZINC, TOX21, and PROTEINS. Key contributions include (1) establishing the direct link between attention mechanisms and MAs generation in edge-featured GNNs, (2) developing a robust definition and detection method for MAs enabling reliable post-hoc interpretability. Overall, our study reveals the complex interplay between attention mechanisms, edge-featured GNNs model, and MAs emergence, providing crucial insights for relating GNNs internals to domain knowledge.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+12...</summary><p>10+12 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

We present a comprehensive analysis of time integration methods, highlighting the adaptation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth scheme to enhance long-term prediction robustness in auto-regressive models. Additionally, we improve temporal prediction accuracy through a multi-step rollout strategy that incorporates multiple future time steps during training, supported by three newly proposed approaches that dynamically adjust the importance of each future step. Despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps (a 7:1 prediction-to-training ratio) achieving an error of only 1.6% compared to the vanilla auto-regressive approach. Moreover, our framework demonstrates an 83% improvement in rollout performance over the standard noise injection method, a standard technique for enhancing long-term rollout performance. Its effectiveness is further validated in more challenging scenarios with truncated meshes, showcasing its adaptability and robustness in practical applications. This work introduces a versatile framework for robust long-term spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions that shows potential for mitigating error accumulation across various model types and engineering disciplines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Alzheimer's Diagnosis: Leveraging Anatomical Landmarks in Graph Convolutional Neural Networks on Tetrahedral Meshes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05031v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative condition that affects millions around the world. As one of the main biomarkers in the AD diagnosis procedure, brain amyloid positivity is typically identified by positron emission tomography (PET), which is costly and invasive. Brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) may provide a safer and more convenient solution for the AD diagnosis. Recent advances in geometric deep learning have facilitated sMRI analysis and early diagnosis of AD. However, determining AD pathology, such as brain amyloid deposition, in preclinical stage remains challenging, as less significant morphological changes can be observed. As a result, few AD classification models are generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity classification task. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs), on the other hand, have recently achieved remarkable success in predicting brain amyloid positivity and identifying individuals with high risk of being brain amyloid positive. However, individuals in medium risk group still require gold standard tests such as Amyloid PET for further evaluation. Inspired by the recent success of transformer architectures, we propose a geometric deep learning model based on transformer that is both scalable and robust to variations in input volumetric mesh size. Our work introduced a novel tokenization scheme for tetrahedral meshes, incorporating anatomical landmarks generated by a pre-trained Gaussian process model. Our model achieved superior classification performance in AD classification task. In addition, we showed that the model was also generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity prediction with individuals in the medium risk class, where BM alone cannot achieve a clear classification. Our work may enrich geometric deep learning research and improve AD diagnosis accuracy without using expensive and invasive PET scans.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Virtual Sensing in Complex Systems: Addressing Heterogeneous Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18691v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time condition monitoring is crucial for the reliable and efficient operation of complex systems. However, relying solely on physical sensors can be limited due to their cost, placement constraints, or inability to directly measure certain critical parameters. Virtual sensing addresses these limitations by leveraging readily available sensor data and system knowledge to estimate inaccessible parameters or infer system states. The increasing complexity of industrial systems necessitates deployments of sensors with diverse modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of system states. These sensors capture data at varying frequencies to monitor both rapid and slowly varying system dynamics, as well as local and global state evolutions of the systems. This leads to heterogeneous temporal dynamics, which, particularly under varying operational end environmental conditions, pose a significant challenge for accurate virtual sensing. To address this, we propose a Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network (HTGNN) framework. HTGNN explicitly models signals from diverse sensors and integrates operating conditions into the model architecture. We evaluate HTGNN using two newly released datasets: a bearing dataset with diverse load conditions for bearing load prediction and a year-long simulated dataset for predicting bridge live loads. Our results demonstrate that HTGNN significantly outperforms established baseline methods in both tasks, particularly under highly varying operating conditions. These results highlight HTGNN's potential as a robust and accurate virtual sensing approach for complex systems, paving the way for improved monitoring, predictive maintenance, and enhanced system performance.

| **[KAGNNs: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks meet Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18380v4)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto tool for learning node and graph representations. Most GNNs typically consist of a sequence of neighborhood aggregation (a.k.a., message-passing) layers, within which the representation of each node is updated based on those of its neighbors. The most expressive message-passing GNNs can be obtained through the use of the sum aggregator and of MLPs for feature transformation, thanks to their universal approximation capabilities. However, the limitations of MLPs recently motivated the introduction of another family of universal approximators, called Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) which rely on a different representation theorem. In this work, we compare the performance of KANs against that of MLPs on graph learning tasks. We implement three new KAN-based GNN layers, inspired respectively by the GCN, GAT and GIN layers. We evaluate two different implementations of KANs using two distinct base families of functions, namely B-splines and radial basis functions. We perform extensive experiments on node classification, link prediction, graph classification and graph regression datasets. Our results indicate that KANs are on-par with or better than MLPs on all tasks studied in this paper. We also show that the size and training speed of RBF-based KANs is only marginally higher than for MLPs, making them viable alternatives.

| **[Graph Neural Networks for Edge Signals: Orientation Equivariance and Invariance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16935v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications in traffic, civil engineering, or electrical engineering revolve around edge-level signals. Such signals can be categorized as inherently directed, for example, the water flow in a pipe network, and undirected, like the diameter of a pipe. Topological methods model edge signals with inherent direction by representing them relative to a so-called orientation assigned to each edge. These approaches can neither model undirected edge signals nor distinguish if an edge itself is directed or undirected. We address these shortcomings by (i) revising the notion of orientation equivariance to enable edge direction-aware topological models, (ii) proposing orientation invariance as an additional requirement to describe signals without inherent direction, and (iii) developing EIGN, an architecture composed of novel direction-aware edge-level graph shift operators, that provably fulfills the aforementioned desiderata. It is the first general-purpose topological GNN for edge-level signals that can model directed and undirected signals while distinguishing between directed and undirected edges. A comprehensive evaluation shows that EIGN outperforms prior work in edge-level tasks, for example, improving in RMSE on flow simulation tasks by up to 23.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixed Graph Contrastive Network for Semi-Supervised Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02796v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved promising performance in semi-supervised node classification in recent years. However, the problem of insufficient supervision, together with representation collapse, largely limits the performance of the GNNs in this field. To alleviate the collapse of node representations in semi-supervised scenario, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning method, termed Mixed Graph Contrastive Network (MGCN). In our method, we improve the discriminative capability of the latent embeddings by an interpolation-based augmentation strategy and a correlation reduction mechanism. Specifically, we first conduct the interpolation-based augmentation in the latent space and then force the prediction model to change linearly between samples. Second, we enable the learned network to tell apart samples across two interpolation-perturbed views through forcing the correlation matrix across views to approximate an identity matrix. By combining the two settings, we extract rich supervision information from both the abundant unlabeled nodes and the rare yet valuable labeled nodes for discriminative representation learning. Extensive experimental results on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the generality of MGCN compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. The code of MGCN is available at https://github.com/xihongyang1999/MGCN on Github.</p></details> |  |

Guiding LLMs to construct thought chains can enhance their deliberate reasoning abilities, but also faces challenges such as hallucination. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can provide explicit structured knowledge for LLMs to alleviate these issues. However, existing KG-enhanced methods often overlook explicit graph learning, making it challenging to efficiently provide precise reasoning chains for LLMs. Following dual-process theory, we propose Dual-Reasoning (DualR), a novel framework that integrates an external system based on Graph Neural Network (GNN) for explicit reasoning on KGs, complementing the implicit reasoning of LLMs through externalized reasoning chains. DualR designs an LLM-empowered GNN module for explicit learning on KGs, efficiently extracting high-quality reasoning chains. These reasoning chains are then refined to a knowledge-enhanced multiple-choice prompt, guiding a frozen LLM to reason thoughtfully for final answer determination. Extensive experiments on three benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that DualR achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches introduce weight sharing across tailored architectures, generating unique GNN architectures for each graph end-to-end. However, existing GraphNAS methods do not account for distribution patterns across different graphs and heavily rely on extensive training data. With sparse or single training graphs, these methods struggle to discover optimal mappings between graphs and architectures, failing to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose node-specific graph neural architecture search(NodeNAS), which aims to tailor distinct aggregation methods for different nodes through disentangling node topology and graph distribution with limited datasets. We further propose adaptive aggregation attention based Multi-dim NodeNAS method(MNNAS), which learns an node-specific architecture customizer with good generalizability. Specifically, we extend the vertical depth of the search space, supporting simultaneous node-specific architecture customization across multiple dimensions. Moreover, we model the power-law distribution of node degrees under varying assortativity, encoding structure invariant information to guide architecture customization across each dimension. Extensive experiments across supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that MNNAS surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms and achieves excellent OOD generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by DASFAA2025</p></details> |

They exhibit high data efficiency during training and significantly reduced inference time for interatomic potential calculations compared to classical approaches. Key to these models is the Clebsch-Gordon (CG) tensor product, a kernel that contracts two dense feature vectors with a highly structured sparse tensor to produce a dense output vector. The operation, which may be repeated millions of times for typical equivariant models, is a costly and inefficient bottleneck. We introduce a GPU sparse kernel generator for the CG tensor product that provides significant speedup over the best existing open and closed-source implementations. Our implementation achieves high performance by carefully managing GPU shared memory through static analysis at model compile-time, minimizing reads and writes to global memory. We break the tensor product into a series of kernels with operands that fit entirely into registers, enabling us to emit long arithmetic instruction streams that maximize instruction-level parallelism. By fusing the CG tensor product with a subsequent graph convolution, we reduce both intermediate storage and global memory traffic over naive approaches that duplicate input data. We also provide optimized kernels for the gradient of the CG tensor product and a novel identity for the higher partial derivatives required to predict interatomic forces. Our fused kernels offer up to 4.5x speedup for the forward pass and 3x for the backward pass over NVIDIA cuEquivariance, as well as >10x speedup over the widely-used e3nn package. We offer up to 5.3x inference-time speedup for the MACE chemistry foundation model over the original unoptimized version.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

The problem is framed as a constrained statistical learning task, where each network node operates using only local information. Opportunistic routing exploits the broadcast nature of wireless communication to dynamically select optimal forwarding nodes, enabling the information to reach the destination through multiple relay nodes simultaneously. To solve this, we propose a State-Augmentation (SA) based distributed optimization approach aimed at maximizing the total information handled by the source nodes in the network. The problem formulation leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which perform graph convolutions based on the topological connections between network nodes. Using an unsupervised learning paradigm, we extract routing policies from the GNN architecture, enabling optimal decisions for source nodes across various flows. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance when training a GNN-parameterized model, particularly when compared to baseline algorithms. Additionally, applying the method to real-world network topologies and wireless ad-hoc network test beds validates its effectiveness, highlighting the robustness and transferability of GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Current methods using dense point clouds for accurate place recognition do not scale well due to computationally expensive scan-to-scan comparisons. Alternative object-centric approaches are more efficient but often struggle with sensitivity to viewpoint variation. In this work, we introduce REGRACE, a novel approach that addresses these challenges of scalability and perspective difference in re-localization by using LiDAR-based submaps. We introduce rotation-invariant features for each labeled object and enhance them with neighborhood context through a graph neural network. To identify potential revisits, we employ a scalable bag-of-words approach, pooling one learned global feature per submap. Additionally, we define a revisit with geometrical consistency cues rather than embedding distance, allowing us to recognize far-away loop closures. Our evaluations demonstrate that REGRACE achieves similar results compared to state-of-the-art place recognition and registration baselines while being twice as fast.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS2025</p></details> |

In most cases, Backscattered Electron (BSE) images obtained using SEM do not contain sufficient information for mineral segmentation. Therefore, imaging is often complemented with point-wise Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) spectral measurements that provide highly accurate information about the chemical composition but that are time-consuming to acquire. This motivates the use of sparse spectral data in conjunction with BSE images for mineral segmentation. The unstructured nature of the spectral data makes most traditional image fusion techniques unsuitable for BSE-EDS fusion. We propose using graph neural networks to fuse the two modalities and segment the mineral phases simultaneously. Our results demonstrate that providing EDS data for as few as 1% of BSE pixels produces accurate segmentation, enabling rapid analysis of mineral samples. The proposed data fusion pipeline is versatile and can be adapted to other domains that involve image data and point-wise measurements.</p></details> |  |

Building on the inherent connection between attention and graph theory, we reformulate the Transformer's attention mechanism as a graph operation and propose Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention. This method leverages advanced graph modeling strategies, including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA), to enrich the representation of relational structures. Our approach captures complex dependencies and generalizes across tasks, as evidenced by a reduced generalization gap and improved learning performance. Additionally, we expand the concept of graph-aware attention to introduce Sparse GIN-Attention, a fine-tuning approach that employs sparse GINs. By interpreting attention matrices as sparse adjacency graphs, this technique enhances the adaptability of pre-trained foundational models with minimal computational overhead, endowing them with graph-aware capabilities. Sparse GIN-Attention fine-tuning achieves improved training dynamics and better generalization compared to alternative methods like low-rank adaption (LoRA). We discuss latent graph-like structures within traditional attention mechanisms, offering a new lens through which Transformers can be understood. By evolving Transformers as hierarchical GIN models for relational reasoning. This perspective suggests profound implications for foundational model development, enabling the design of architectures that dynamically adapt to both local and global dependencies. Applications in bioinformatics, materials science, language modeling, and beyond could benefit from this synthesis of relational and sequential data modeling, setting the stage for interpretable and generalizable modeling strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Channel-Attentive Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00578v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) set the state-of-the-art in representation learning for graph-structured data. They are used in many domains, from online social networks to complex molecules. Most GNNs leverage the message-passing paradigm and achieve strong performances on various tasks. However, the message-passing mechanism used in most models suffers from over-smoothing as a GNN's depth increases. The over-smoothing degrades GNN's performance due to the increased similarity between the representations of unrelated nodes. This study proposes an adaptive channel-wise message-passing approach to alleviate the over-smoothing. The proposed model, Channel-Attentive GNN, learns how to attend to neighboring nodes and their feature channels. Thus, much diverse information can be transferred between nodes during message-passing. Experiments with widely used benchmark datasets show that the proposed model is more resistant to over-smoothing than baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performances for various graphs with strong heterophily.

| **[GNNMerge: Merging of GNN Models Without Accessing Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03384v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging has gained prominence in machine learning as a method to integrate multiple trained models into a single model without accessing the original training data. While existing approaches have demonstrated success in domains such as computer vision and NLP, their application to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) remains unexplored. These methods often rely on the assumption of shared initialization, which is seldom applicable to GNNs. In this work, we undertake the first benchmarking study of model merging algorithms for GNNs, revealing their limited effectiveness in this context. To address these challenges, we propose GNNMerge, which utilizes a task-agnostic node embedding alignment strategy to merge GNNs. Furthermore, we establish that under a mild relaxation, the proposed optimization objective admits direct analytical solutions for widely used GNN architectures, significantly enhancing its computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations across diverse datasets, tasks, and architectures establish GNNMerge to be up to 24% more accurate than existing methods while delivering over 2 orders of magnitude speed-up compared to training from scratch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leap: Inductive Link Prediction via Learnable TopologyAugmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03331v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction is a crucial task in many downstream applications of graph machine learning. To this end, Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a widely used technique for link prediction, mainly in transductive settings, where the goal is to predict missing links between existing nodes. However, many real-life applications require an inductive setting that accommodates for new nodes, coming into an existing graph. Thus, recently inductive link prediction has attracted considerable attention, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is the popular choice of most studies to learn node representations. However, these approaches have limited expressivity and do not fully capture the graph's structural signal. Therefore, in this work we propose LEAP, an inductive link prediction method based on LEArnable toPology augmentation. Unlike previous methods, LEAP models the inductive bias from both the structure and node features, and hence is more expressive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to provide structural contexts for new nodes via learnable augmentation in inductive settings. Extensive experiments on seven real-world homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs demonstrates that LEAP significantly surpasses SOTA methods. The improvements are up to 22\% and 17\% in terms of AUC and average precision, respectively. The code and datasets are available on GitHub (https://github.com/AhmedESamy/LEAP/)</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in Machine Learning, Optimization, and Data Science, Springer Nature Switzerland</p></details> |

They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models as Predictors in Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03258v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there has been growing interest in Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for graph-based tasks. By leveraging LLMs as predictors, GFMs have demonstrated impressive generalizability across various tasks and datasets. However, existing research on LLMs as predictors has predominantly focused on static graphs, leaving their potential in dynamic graph prediction unexplored. In this work, we pioneer using LLMs for predictive tasks on dynamic graphs. We identify two key challenges: the constraints imposed by context length when processing large-scale historical data and the significant variability in domain characteristics, both of which complicate the development of a unified predictor. To address these challenges, we propose the GraphAgent-Dynamic (GAD) Framework, a multi-agent system that leverages collaborative LLMs. In contrast to using a single LLM as the predictor, GAD incorporates global and local summary agents to generate domain-specific knowledge, enhancing its transferability across domains. Additionally, knowledge reflection agents enable adaptive updates to GAD's knowledge, maintaining a unified and self-consistent architecture. In experiments, GAD demonstrates performance comparable to or even exceeds that of full-supervised graph neural networks without dataset-specific training. Finally, to enhance the task-specific performance of LLM-based predictors, we discuss potential improvements, such as dataset-specific fine-tuning to LLMs. By developing tailored strategies for different tasks, we provide new insights for the future design of LLM-based predictors.</p></details> |  |
| **[NodeReg: Mitigating the Imbalance and Distribution Shift Effects in Semi-Supervised Node Classification via Norm Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03211v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aggregating information from neighboring nodes benefits graph neural networks (GNNs) in semi-supervised node classification tasks. Nevertheless, this mechanism also renders nodes susceptible to the influence of their neighbors. For instance, this will occur when the neighboring nodes are imbalanced or the neighboring nodes contain noise, which can even affect the GNN's ability to generalize out of distribution. We find that ensuring the consistency of the norm for node representations can significantly reduce the impact of these two issues on GNNs. To this end, we propose a regularized optimization method called NodeReg that enforces the consistency of node representation norms. This method is simple but effective and satisfies Lipschitz continuity, thus facilitating stable optimization and significantly improving semi-supervised node classification performance under the above two scenarios. To illustrate, in the imbalance scenario, when training a GCN with an imbalance ratio of 0.1, NodeReg outperforms the most competitive baselines by 1.4%-25.9% in F1 score across five public datasets. Similarly, in the distribution shift scenario, NodeReg outperforms the most competitive baseline by 1.4%-3.1% in accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directly Follows Graphs Go Predictive Process Monitoring With Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03197v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past years, predictive process monitoring (PPM) techniques based on artificial neural networks have evolved as a method to monitor the future behavior of business processes. Existing approaches mostly focus on interpreting the processes as sequences, so-called traces, and feeding them to neural architectures designed to operate on sequential data such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers. In this study, we investigate an alternative way to perform PPM: by transforming each process in its directly-follows-graph (DFG) representation we are able to apply graph neural networks (GNNs) for the prediction tasks. By this, we aim to develop models that are more suitable for complex processes that are long and contain an abundance of loops. In particular, we present different ways to create DFG representations depending on the particular GNN we use. The tested GNNs range from classical node-based to novel edge-based architectures. Further, we investigate the possibility of using multi-graphs. By these steps, we aim to design graph representations that minimize the information loss when transforming traces into graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, many real-world graphs exhibit heterophily, where linked nodes belong to different categories or possess diverse attributes. Additionally, nodes in many domains are associated with textual descriptions, forming heterophilic text-attributed graphs (TAGs). Despite their significance, the study of heterophilic TAGs remains underexplored due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce the Heterophilic Text-attributed Graph Benchmark (HeTGB), a novel benchmark comprising five real-world heterophilic graph datasets from diverse domains, with nodes enriched by extensive textual descriptions. HeTGB enables systematic evaluation of GNNs, pre-trained language models (PLMs) and co-training methods on the node classification task. Through extensive benchmarking experiments, we showcase the utility of text attributes in heterophilic graphs, analyze the challenges posed by heterophilic TAGs and the limitations of existing models, and provide insights into the interplay between graph structures and textual attributes. We have publicly released HeTGB with baseline implementations to facilitate further research in this field.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Generalization on Graphs via Progressive Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02988v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development and evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) generally follow the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption. Yet this assumption is often untenable in practice due to the uncontrollable data generation mechanism. In particular, when the data distribution shows a significant shift, most GNNs would fail to produce reliable predictions and may even make decisions randomly. One of the most promising solutions to improve the model generalization is to pick out causal invariant parts in the input graph. Nonetheless, we observe a significant distribution gap between the causal parts learned by existing methods and the ground truth, leading to undesirable performance. In response to the above issues, this paper presents GPro, a model that learns graph causal invariance with progressive inference. Specifically, the complicated graph causal invariant learning is decomposed into multiple intermediate inference steps from easy to hard, and the perception of GPro is continuously strengthened through a progressive inference process to extract causal features that are stable to distribution shifts. We also enlarge the training distribution by creating counterfactual samples to enhance the capability of the GPro in capturing the causal invariant parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed GPro outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 4.91% on average. For datasets with more severe distribution shifts, the performance improvement can be up to 6.86%.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

Dance artists who work in partnered settings might have a strong embodied understanding in the moment of how their movements relate to their partner's, but typical documentation of dance fails to capture these varied and subtle relationships. Working closely with dance artists interested in deepening their understanding of partnering, we leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to highlight and interpret the intricate connections shared by two dancers. Using a video-to-3D-pose extraction pipeline, we extract 3D movements from curated videos of contemporary dance duets, apply a dedicated pre-processing to improve the reconstruction, and train a GNN to predict weighted connections between the dancers. By visualizing and interpreting the predicted relationships between the two movers, we demonstrate the potential for graph-based methods to construct alternate models of the collaborative dynamics of duets. Finally, we offer some example strategies for how to use these insights to inform a generative and co-creative studio practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ICCC'25</p></details> |
| **[Deal: Distributed End-to-End GNN Inference for All Nodes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02960v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a new research frontier with various applications and successes. The end-to-end inference for all nodes, is common for GNN embedding models, which are widely adopted in applications like recommendation and advertising. While sharing opportunities arise in GNN tasks (i.e., inference for a few nodes and training), the potential for sharing in full graph end-to-end inference is largely underutilized because traditional efforts fail to fully extract sharing benefits due to overwhelming overheads or excessive memory usage. This paper introduces Deal, a distributed GNN inference system that is dedicated to end-to-end inference for all nodes for graphs with multi-billion edges. First, we unveil and exploit an untapped sharing opportunity during sampling, and maximize the benefits from sharing during subsequent GNN computation. Second, we introduce memory-saving and communication-efficient distributed primitives for lightweight 1-D graph and feature tensor collaborative partitioning-based distributed inference. Third, we introduce partitioned, pipelined communication and fusing feature preparation with the first GNN primitive for end-to-end inference. With Deal, the end-to-end inference time on real-world benchmark datasets is reduced up to 7.70 x and the graph construction time is reduced up to 21.05 x, compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Node-level Contrastive Unlearning on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02959v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph unlearning aims to remove a subset of graph entities (i.e. nodes and edges) from a graph neural network (GNN) trained on the graph. Unlike machine unlearning for models trained on Euclidean-structured data, effectively unlearning a model trained on non-Euclidean-structured data, such as graphs, is challenging because graph entities exhibit mutual dependencies. Existing works utilize graph partitioning, influence function, or additional layers to achieve graph unlearning. However, none of them can achieve high scalability and effectiveness without additional constraints. In this paper, we achieve more effective graph unlearning by utilizing the embedding space. The primary training objective of a GNN is to generate proper embeddings for each node that encapsulates both structural information and node feature representations. Thus, directly optimizing the embedding space can effectively remove the target nodes' information from the model. Based on this intuition, we propose node-level contrastive unlearning (Node-CUL). It removes the influence of the target nodes (unlearning nodes) by contrasting the embeddings of remaining nodes and neighbors of unlearning nodes. Through iterative updates, the embeddings of unlearning nodes gradually become similar to those of unseen nodes, effectively removing the learned information without directly incorporating unseen data. In addition, we introduce a neighborhood reconstruction method that optimizes the embeddings of the neighbors in order to remove influence of unlearning nodes to maintain the utility of the GNN model. Experiments on various graph data and models show that our Node-CUL achieves the best unlearn efficacy and enhanced model utility with requiring comparable computing resources with existing frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable and Efficient Multi-Agent Coordination via Graph Neural Network Variational Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02954v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent coordination is crucial for reliable multi-robot navigation in shared spaces such as automated warehouses. In regions of dense robot traffic, local coordination methods may fail to find a deadlock-free solution. In these scenarios, it is appropriate to let a central unit generate a global schedule that decides the passing order of robots. However, the runtime of such centralized coordination methods increases significantly with the problem scale. In this paper, we propose to leverage Graph Neural Network Variational Autoencoders (GNN-VAE) to solve the multi-agent coordination problem at scale faster than through centralized optimization. We formulate the coordination problem as a graph problem and collect ground truth data using a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) solver. During training, our learning framework encodes good quality solutions of the graph problem into a latent space. At inference time, solution samples are decoded from the sampled latent variables, and the lowest-cost sample is selected for coordination. Finally, the feasible proposal with the highest performance index is selected for the deployment. By construction, our GNN-VAE framework returns solutions that always respect the constraints of the considered coordination problem. Numerical results show that our approach trained on small-scale problems can achieve high-quality solutions even for large-scale problems with 250 robots, being much faster than other baselines.

We address safety of networked autonomous systems where the information exchanged between robots incurs communication delays. We formalize a notion of distributed control barrier function for multi-robot systems, a safety certificate amenable to a distributed implementation, which provides formal ground to using graph neural networks to learn safe distributed controllers. Further, we observe that learning a distributed controller ignoring delays can severely degrade safety. We finally propose a predictor-based framework to train a safe distributed controller under communication delays, where the current state of nearby robots is predicted from received data and age-of-information. Numerical experiments on multi-robot collision avoidance show that our predictor-based approach can significantly improve the safety of a learned distributed controller under communication delays.

| **[Graph Neural Networks for Fast Contingency Analysis of Power Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04213v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The successful integration of machine learning models into decision support tools for grid operation hinges on effectively capturing the topological changes in daily operations. Frequent grid reconfigurations and N-k security analyses have to be conducted to ensure a reliable and secure power grid, leading to a vast combinatorial space of possible topologies and operating states. This combinatorial complexity, which increases with grid size, poses a significant computational challenge for traditional solvers. In this paper, we combine Physics-Informed Neural Networks with graph-aware neural network architectures, i.e., a Guided-Dropout (GD) and an Edge-Varying Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture to learn the set points for a grid that considers all probable single-line reconfigurations (all critical N-1 scenarios) and subsequently apply the trained models to N-k scenarios. We demonstrate how incorporating the underlying physical equations for the network equations within the training procedure of the GD and the GNN architectures performs with N-1, N-2, and N-3 case studies. Using the AC Power Flow as a guiding application, we test our methods on the 6-bus, 24-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus systems. We find that GNN not only achieves the task of contingency screening with satisfactory accuracy but does this up to 400 times faster than the Newton-Raphson power flow solver. Moreover, our results provide a comparison of the GD and GNN models in terms of accuracy and computational speed and provide recommendations on their adoption for contingency analysis of power systems.</p></details> |  |

Mesh data can provide an intuitive and practical expression of rich 3D information. However, its disordered, irregular data structure and complex surface information make it challenging to apply with deep learning models directly. Traditional mesh data processing methods often rely on mesh models with many limitations, such as manifold, which restrict their application scopes in reality and do not fully utilize the advantages of mesh models. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end framework for addressing the challenges associated with deep learning in mesh models centered around graph neural networks (GNN) and is titled InfoGNN. InfoGNN treats the mesh model as a graph, which enables it to handle irregular mesh data efficiently. Moreover, we propose InfoConv and InfoMP modules, which utilize the position information of the points and fully use the static information such as face normals, dihedral angles, and dynamic global feature information to fully use all kinds of data. In addition, InfoGNN is an end-to-end framework, and we simplify the network design to make it more efficient, paving the way for efficient deep learning of complex 3D models. We conducted experiments on several publicly available datasets, and the results show that InfoGNN achieves excellent performance in mesh classification and segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper fills the gap and presents the Binary Classification Social Network Dataset (\textit{BiSND}), designed for graph machine learning applications to predict binary classes. We present the BiSND in \textit{tabular and graph} formats to verify its robustness across classical and advanced machine learning. We employ a diverse set of classifiers, including four traditional machine learning algorithms (Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, XGBoost), one Deep Neural Network (multi-layer perceptrons), one Graph Neural Network (Graph Convolutional Network), and three state-of-the-art Graph Contrastive Learning methods (BGRL, GRACE, DAENS).

| **[Incorporating graph neural network into route choice model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02315v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Route choice models are one of the most important foundations for transportation research. Traditionally, theory-based models have been utilized for their great interpretability, such as logit models and Recursive logit models. More recently, machine learning approaches have gained attentions for their better prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose novel hybrid models that integrate the Recursive logit model with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance both predictive performance and model interpretability. To the authors' knowldedge, GNNs have not been utilized for route choice modeling, despite their proven effectiveness in capturing road network features and their widespread use in other transportation research areas. We mathematically show that our use of GNN is not only beneficial for enhancing the prediction performance, but also relaxing the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives property without relying on strong assumptions. This is due to the fact that a specific type of GNN can efficiently capture multiple cross-effect patterns on networks from data. By applying the proposed models to one-day travel trajectory data in Tokyo, we confirmed their higher prediction accuracy compared to the existing models.</p></details> |  |

A straightforward approach is to model with orientation-standardized structures through structure-aligned coordinate systems, or"frames." However, unlike molecules, determining frames for crystal structures is challenging due to their infinite and highly symmetric nature. In particular, existing methods rely on a statically fixed frame for each structure, determined solely by its structural information, regardless of the task under consideration. Here, we rethink the role of frames, questioning whether such simplistic alignment with the structure is sufficient, and propose the concept of dynamic frames. While accommodating the infinite and symmetric nature of crystals, these frames provide each atom with a dynamic view of its local environment, focusing on actively interacting atoms. We demonstrate this concept by utilizing the attention mechanism in a recent transformer-based crystal encoder, resulting in a new architecture called CrystalFramer. Extensive experiments show that CrystalFramer outperforms conventional frames and existing crystal encoders in various crystal property prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 ma...</summary><p>12 main pages, 3 main figures, and 4 main tables.

Learning the dynamics of such systems is essential for predicting the temporal evolution of populations across novel samples and unseen environments. Flow-based models allow for learning these dynamics at the population level - they model the evolution of the entire distribution of samples. However, current flow-based models are limited to a single initial population and a set of predefined conditions which describe different dynamics. We argue that multiple processes in natural sciences have to be represented as vector fields on the Wasserstein manifold of probability densities. That is, the change of the population at any moment in time depends on the population itself due to the interactions between samples. In particular, this is crucial for personalized medicine where the development of diseases and their respective treatment response depend on the microenvironment of cells specific to each patient. We propose Meta Flow Matching (MFM), a practical approach to integrate along these vector fields on the Wasserstein manifold by amortizing the flow model over the initial populations. Namely, we embed the population of samples using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and use these embeddings to train a Flow Matching model. This gives MFM the ability to generalize over the initial distributions, unlike previously proposed methods. We demonstrate the ability of MFM to improve the prediction of individual treatment responses on a large-scale multi-patient single-cell drug screen dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Central to the success of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which scores the similarity between query and key matrices to modulate a value matrix. This operation bears striking similarities to digraph convolution, prompting an investigation into whether digraph convolution could serve as an alternative to self-attention. In this study, we formalize this concept by introducing a synthetic unitary digraph convolution based on the digraph Fourier transform. The resulting model, which we term Converter, effectively converts a Transformer into a Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) form. We have tested Converter on Long-Range Arena benchmark, long document classification, and DNA sequence-based taxonomy classification. Our experimental results demonstrate that Converter achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency and architectural simplicity, which establishes it as a lightweight yet powerful Transformer variant.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, and 8 tables; pseudocode improved</p></details> |

| **[Coordinated Multi-Robot Navigation with Formation Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01618v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-robot navigation is an essential ability for a team of robots operating in diverse environments. Robot teams often need to maintain specific formations, such as wedge formations, to enhance visibility, positioning, and efficiency during fast movement. However, complex environments such as narrow corridors challenge rigid team formations, which makes effective formation control difficult in real-world environments. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Adaptive Formation with Oscillation Reduction (AFOR) approach to improve coordinated multi-robot navigation. We develop AFOR under the theoretical framework of hierarchical learning and integrate a spring-damper model with hierarchical learning to enable both team coordination and individual robot control. At the upper level, a graph neural network facilitates formation adaptation and information sharing among the robots. At the lower level, reinforcement learning enables each robot to navigate and avoid obstacles while maintaining the formations. We conducted extensive experiments using Gazebo in the Robot Operating System (ROS), a high-fidelity Unity3D simulator with ROS, and real robot teams. Results demonstrate that AFOR enables smooth navigation with formation adaptation in complex scenarios and outperforms previous methods.

| **[Quantifying Point Contributions: A Lightweight Framework for Efficient and Effective Query-Driven Trajectory Simplification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02047v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large volumes of trajectory data accumulate, simplifying trajectories to reduce storage and querying costs is increasingly studied. Existing proposals face three main problems. First, they require numerous iterations to decide which GPS points to delete. Second, they focus only on the relationships between neighboring points (local information) while neglecting the overall structure (global information), reducing the global similarity between the simplified and original trajectories and making it difficult to maintain consistency in query results, especially for similarity-based queries. Finally, they fail to differentiate the importance of points with similar features, leading to suboptimal selection of points to retain the original trajectory information. We propose MLSimp, a novel Mutual Learning query-driven trajectory simplification framework that integrates two distinct models: GNN-TS, based on graph neural networks, and Diff-TS, based on diffusion models. GNN-TS evaluates the importance of a point according to its globality, capturing its correlation with the entire trajectory, and its uniqueness, capturing its differences from neighboring points. It also incorporates attention mechanisms in the GNN layers, enabling simultaneous data integration from all points within the same trajectory and refining representations, thus avoiding iterative processes. Diff-TS generates amplified signals to enable the retention of the most important points at low compression rates. Experiments involving eight baselines on three databases show that MLSimp reduces the simplification time by 42%--70% and improves query accuracy over simplified trajectories by up to 34.6%.</p></details> | Accepted by VLDB2025 |
| **[Learning Exposure Mapping Functions for Inferring Heterogeneous Peer Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01722v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In causal inference, interference refers to the phenomenon in which the actions of peers in a network can influence an individual's outcome. Peer effect refers to the difference in counterfactual outcomes of an individual for different levels of peer exposure, the extent to which an individual is exposed to the treatments, actions, or behaviors of peers. Estimating peer effects requires deciding how to represent peer exposure. Typically, researchers define an exposure mapping function that aggregates peer treatments and outputs peer exposure. Most existing approaches for defining exposure mapping functions assume peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers. Recent studies have investigated more complex functions of peer exposure which capture that different peers can exert different degrees of influence. However, none of these works have explicitly considered the problem of automatically learning the exposure mapping function. In this work, we focus on learning this function for the purpose of estimating heterogeneous peer effects, where heterogeneity refers to the variation in counterfactual outcomes for the same peer exposure but different individual's contexts. We develop EgoNetGNN, a graph neural network (GNN)-based method, to automatically learn the appropriate exposure mapping function allowing for complex peer influence mechanisms that, in addition to peer treatments, can involve the local neighborhood structure and edge attributes. We show that GNN models that use peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers or learn peer exposure naively face difficulty accounting for such influence mechanisms. Our comprehensive evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network data shows that our method is more robust to different unknown underlying influence mechanisms when estimating heterogeneous peer effects when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Ails Generative Structure-based Drug Design: Expressivity is Too Little or Too Much?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06050v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several generative models with elaborate training and sampling procedures have been proposed to accelerate structure-based drug design (SBDD); however, their empirical performance turns out to be suboptimal. We seek to better understand this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Since most of these models apply graph neural networks (GNNs), one may suspect that they inherit the representational limitations of GNNs. We analyze this aspect, establishing the first such results for protein-ligand complexes. A plausible counterview may attribute the underperformance of these models to their excessive parameterizations, inducing expressivity at the expense of generalization. We investigate this possibility with a simple metric-aware approach that learns an economical surrogate for affinity to infer an unlabelled molecular graph and optimizes for labels conditioned on this graph and molecular properties. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art results using 100x fewer trainable parameters and affords up to 1000x speedup. Collectively, our findings underscore the need to reassess and redirect the existing paradigm and efforts for SBDD.

| **[GRNFormer: A Biologically-Guided Framework for Integrating Gene Regulatory Networks into RNA Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01682v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have shown promising capabilities in capturing gene expression patterns. However, current approaches face critical limitations: they ignore biological prior knowledge encoded in gene regulatory relationships and fail to leverage multi-omics signals that could provide complementary regulatory insights. In this paper, we propose GRNFormer, a new framework that systematically integrates multi-scale Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) inferred from multi-omics data into RNA foundation model training. Our framework introduces two key innovations. First, we introduce a pipeline for constructing hierarchical GRNs that capture regulatory relationships at both cell-type-specific and cell-specific resolutions. Second, we design a structure-aware integration framework that addresses the information asymmetry in GRNs through two technical advances: (1) A graph topological adapter using multi-head cross-attention to weight regulatory relationships dynamically, and (2) a novel edge perturbation strategy that perturb GRNs with biologically-informed co-expression links to augment graph neural network training. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on three representative downstream tasks across multiple model architectures to demonstrate the effectiveness of GRNFormer. It achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines: $3.6\%$ increase in drug response prediction correlation, $9.6\%$ improvement in single-cell drug classification AUC, and $1.1\%$ average gain in gene perturbation prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

| **[TopoDiffusionNet: A Topology-aware Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16646v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating visually impressive images but often struggle to generate images with a specified topology. The Betti number, which represents the number of structures in an image, is a fundamental measure in topology. Yet, diffusion models fail to satisfy even this basic constraint. This limitation restricts their utility in applications requiring exact control, like robotics and environmental modeling. To address this, we propose TopoDiffusionNet (TDN), a novel approach that enforces diffusion models to maintain the desired topology. We leverage tools from topological data analysis, particularly persistent homology, to extract the topological structures within an image. We then design a topology-based objective function to guide the denoising process, preserving intended structures while suppressing noisy ones. Our experiments across four datasets demonstrate significant improvements in topological accuracy. TDN is the first to integrate topology with diffusion models, opening new avenues of research in this area.

Previous diffusion-based methods primarily rely on separate spatial and temporal attention mechanisms within 3D U-Net. In contrast, state-of-the-art video Diffusion Transformers (DiT) models use 3D full attention, which does not explicitly separate temporal and spatial information. Thus, the interaction between spatial and temporal dimensions makes decoupling motion and appearance more challenging for DiT models. In this paper, we propose DeT, a method that adapts DiT models to improve motion transfer ability. Our approach introduces a simple yet effective temporal kernel to smooth DiT features along the temporal dimension, facilitating the decoupling of foreground motion from background appearance. Meanwhile, the temporal kernel effectively captures temporal variations in DiT features, which are closely related to motion. Moreover, we introduce explicit supervision along dense trajectories in the latent feature space to further enhance motion consistency. Additionally, we present MTBench, a general and challenging benchmark for motion transfer. We also introduce a hybrid motion fidelity metric that considers both the global and local motion similarity. Therefore, our work provides a more comprehensive evaluation than previous works. Extensive experiments on MTBench demonstrate that DeT achieves the best trade-off between motion fidelity and edit fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dereflection Any Image with Diffusion Priors and Diversified Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17347v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reflection removal of a single image remains a highly challenging task due to the complex entanglement between target scenes and unwanted reflections. Despite significant progress, existing methods are hindered by the scarcity of high-quality, diverse data and insufficient restoration priors, resulting in limited generalization across various real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dereflection Any Image, a comprehensive solution with an efficient data preparation pipeline and a generalizable model for robust reflection removal. First, we introduce a dataset named Diverse Reflection Removal (DRR) created by randomly rotating reflective mediums in target scenes, enabling variation of reflection angles and intensities, and setting a new benchmark in scale, quality, and diversity. Second, we propose a diffusion-based framework with one-step diffusion for deterministic outputs and fast inference. To ensure stable learning, we design a three-stage progressive training strategy, including reflection-invariant finetuning to encourage consistent outputs across varying reflection patterns that characterize our dataset. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves SOTA performance on both common benchmarks and challenging in-the-wild images, showing superior generalization across diverse real-world scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[MANTA: Diffusion Mamba for Efficient and Effective Stochastic Long-Term Dense Anticipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08837v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term dense action anticipation is very challenging since it requires predicting actions and their durations several minutes into the future based on provided video observations. To model the uncertainty of future outcomes, stochastic models predict several potential future action sequences for the same observation. Recent work has further proposed to incorporate uncertainty modelling for observed frames by simultaneously predicting per-frame past and future actions in a unified manner. While such joint modelling of actions is beneficial, it requires long-range temporal capabilities to connect events across distant past and future time points. However, the previous work struggles to achieve such a long-range understanding due to its limited and/or sparse receptive field. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel MANTA (MAmba for ANTicipation) network. Our model enables effective long-term temporal modelling even for very long sequences while maintaining linear complexity in sequence length. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on three datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and Assembly101 - while also significantly improving computational and memory efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/olga-zats/DIFF_MANTA .</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |
| **[Preference-Guided Diffusion for Multi-Objective Offline Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17299v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline multi-objective optimization aims to identify Pareto-optimal solutions given a dataset of designs and their objective values. In this work, we propose a preference-guided diffusion model that generates Pareto-optimal designs by leveraging a classifier-based guidance mechanism. Our guidance classifier is a preference model trained to predict the probability that one design dominates another, directing the diffusion model toward optimal regions of the design space. Crucially, this preference model generalizes beyond the training distribution, enabling the discovery of Pareto-optimal solutions outside the observed dataset. We introduce a novel diversity-aware preference guidance, augmenting Pareto dominance preference with diversity criteria. This ensures that generated solutions are optimal and well-distributed across the objective space, a capability absent in prior generative methods for offline multi-objective optimization. We evaluate our approach on various continuous offline multi-objective optimization tasks and find that it consistently outperforms other inverse/generative approaches while remaining competitive with forward/surrogate-based optimization methods. Our results highlight the effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion models in generating diverse and high-quality solutions that approximate the Pareto front well.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Policy: Learning Disentangled Action Space for Multi-Task Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18707v4)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning visuomotor policy for multi-task robotic manipulation has been a long-standing challenge for the robotics community. The difficulty lies in the diversity of action space: typically, a goal can be accomplished in multiple ways, resulting in a multimodal action distribution for a single task. The complexity of action distribution escalates as the number of tasks increases. In this work, we propose \textbf{Discrete Policy}, a robot learning method for training universal agents capable of multi-task manipulation skills. Discrete Policy employs vector quantization to map action sequences into a discrete latent space, facilitating the learning of task-specific codes. These codes are then reconstructed into the action space conditioned on observations and language instruction. We evaluate our method on both simulation and multiple real-world embodiments, including both single-arm and bimanual robot settings. We demonstrate that our proposed Discrete Policy outperforms a well-established Diffusion Policy baseline and many state-of-the-art approaches, including ACT, Octo, and OpenVLA. For example, in a real-world multi-task training setting with five tasks, Discrete Policy achieves an average success rate that is 26\% higher than Diffusion Policy and 15\% higher than OpenVLA. As the number of tasks increases to 12, the performance gap between Discrete Policy and Diffusion Policy widens to 32.5\%, further showcasing the advantages of our approach. Our work empirically demonstrates that learning multi-task policies within the latent space is a vital step toward achieving general-purpose agents.</p></details> | Accept to ICRA 2025 |
| **[SuperPC: A Single Diffusion Model for Point Cloud Completion, Upsampling, Denoising, and Colorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14558v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud (PC) processing tasks-such as completion, upsampling, denoising, and colorization-are crucial in applications like autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. Despite substantial advancements, prior approaches often address each of these tasks independently, with separate models focused on individual issues. However, this isolated approach fails to account for the fact that defects like incompleteness, low resolution, noise, and lack of color frequently coexist, with each defect influencing and correlating with the others. Simply applying these models sequentially can lead to error accumulation from each model, along with increased computational costs. To address these challenges, we introduce SuperPC, the first unified diffusion model capable of concurrently handling all four tasks. Our approach employs a three-level-conditioned diffusion framework, enhanced by a novel spatial-mix-fusion strategy, to leverage the correlations among these four defects for simultaneous, efficient processing. We show that SuperPC outperforms the state-of-the-art specialized models as well as their combination on all four individual tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LazyDiT: Lazy Learning for the Acceleration of Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12444v3)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the preeminent models for a wide array of generative tasks, demonstrating superior performance and efficacy across various applications. The promising results come at the cost of slow inference, as each denoising step requires running the whole transformer model with a large amount of parameters. In this paper, we show that performing the full computation of the model at each diffusion step is unnecessary, as some computations can be skipped by lazily reusing the results of previous steps. Furthermore, we show that the lower bound of similarity between outputs at consecutive steps is notably high, and this similarity can be linearly approximated using the inputs. To verify our demonstrations, we propose the \textbf{LazyDiT}, a lazy learning framework that efficiently leverages cached results from earlier steps to skip redundant computations. Specifically, we incorporate lazy learning layers into the model, effectively trained to maximize laziness, enabling dynamic skipping of redundant computations. Experimental results show that LazyDiT outperforms the DDIM sampler across multiple diffusion transformer models at various resolutions. Furthermore, we implement our method on mobile devices, achieving better performance than DDIM with similar latency.

By contrast, it is challenging for diffusion models to be trained in an E2E fashion. This paper introduces a Deep End-to-End Posterior ENergy (DEEPEN) framework, which enables MAP estimation as well as sampling. We learn the parameters of the posterior, which is the sum of the data consistency error and the negative log-prior distribution, using maximum likelihood optimization in an E2E fashion. The proposed approach does not require algorithm unrolling, and hence has a smaller computational and memory footprint than current E2E methods, while it does not require contraction constraints typically needed by current PnP methods. Our results demonstrate that DEEPEN offers improved performance than current E2E and PnP models in the MAP setting, while it also offers faster sampling compared to diffusion models. In addition, the learned energy-based model is observed to be more robust to changes in image acquisition settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Text-to-Image Generation for Handling Spurious Correlation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17226v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks trained with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) perform well when both training and test data come from the same domain, but they often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution samples. In image classification, these models may rely on spurious correlations that often exist between labels and irrelevant features of images, making predictions unreliable when those features do not exist. We propose a technique to generate training samples with text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models for addressing the spurious correlation problem. First, we compute the best describing token for the visual features pertaining to the causal components of samples by a textual inversion mechanism. Then, leveraging a language segmentation method and a diffusion model, we generate new samples by combining the causal component with the elements from other classes. We also meticulously prune the generated samples based on the prediction probabilities and attribution scores of the ERM model to ensure their correct composition for our objective. Finally, we retrain the ERM model on our augmented dataset. This process reduces the model's reliance on spurious correlations by learning from carefully crafted samples for in which this correlation does not exist. Our experiments show that across different benchmarks, our technique achieves better worst-group accuracy than the existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing methods that rely on bidirectional interaction between the diffusion model and control adapter, UniCon implements a unidirectional flow from the diffusion network to the adapter, allowing the adapter alone to generate the final output. UniCon reduces computational demands by eliminating the need for the diffusion model to compute and store gradients during adapter training. Our results indicate that UniCon reduces GPU memory usage by one-third and increases training speed by 2.3 times, while maintaining the same adapter parameter size. Additionally, without requiring extra computational resources, UniCon enables the training of adapters with double the parameter volume of existing ControlNets. In a series of image conditional generation tasks, UniCon has demonstrated precise responsiveness to control inputs and exceptional generation capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing methods address only a single type of degradation (e.g., blur, noise, or haze) at a time, limiting their real-world applicability where multiple degradations often occur simultaneously. In this paper, we propose UniCoRN, a unified image restoration approach capable of handling multiple degradation types simultaneously using a multi-head diffusion model. Specifically, we uncover the potential of low-level visual cues extracted from images in guiding a controllable diffusion model for real-world image restoration and we design a multi-head control network adaptable via a mixture-of-experts strategy. We train our model without any prior assumption of specific degradations, through a smartly designed curriculum learning recipe. Additionally, we also introduce MetaRestore, a metalens imaging benchmark containing images with multiple degradations and artifacts. Extensive evaluations on several challenging datasets, including our benchmark, demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance gains and can robustly restore images with severe degradations.

Matrix3D utilizes a multi-modal diffusion transformer (DiT) to integrate transformations across several modalities, such as images, camera parameters, and depth maps. The key to Matrix3D's large-scale multi-modal training lies in the incorporation of a mask learning strategy. This enables full-modality model training even with partially complete data, such as bi-modality data of image-pose and image-depth pairs, thus significantly increases the pool of available training data.

To meet modeling requirements, autoregressive models possessing the characteristics of scalability and flexibility embrace a discrete-valued tokenizer, but face the challenge of poor image generation quality. In contrast, diffusion models take advantage of the continuous-valued tokenizer to achieve better generation quality but are subject to low efficiency and complexity. The existing hybrid models are mainly to compensate for information loss and simplify the diffusion learning process. The potential of merging discrete-valued and continuous-valued tokens in the field of image generation has not yet been explored. In this paper, we propose D2C, a novel two-stage method to enhance model generation capacity. In the first stage, the discrete-valued tokens representing coarse-grained image features are sampled by employing a small discrete-valued generator. Then in the second stage, the continuous-valued tokens representing fine-grained image features are learned conditioned on the discrete token sequence. In addition, we design two kinds of fusion modules for seamless interaction. On the ImageNet-256 benchmark, extensive experiment results validate that our model achieves superior performance compared with several continuous-valued and discrete-valued generative models on the class-conditional image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion-based purification methods like DiffPure offer promising defense mechanisms, their computational overhead presents a significant practical limitation. In this paper, we introduce One Step Control Purification (OSCP), a novel defense framework that achieves robust adversarial purification in a single Neural Function Evaluation (NFE) within diffusion models. We propose Gaussian Adversarial Noise Distillation (GAND) as the distillation objective and Controlled Adversarial Purification (CAP) as the inference pipeline, which makes OSCP demonstrate remarkable efficiency while maintaining defense efficacy. Our proposed GAND addresses a fundamental tension between consistency distillation and adversarial perturbation, bridging the gap between natural and adversarial manifolds in the latent space, while remaining computationally efficient through Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA, eliminating the high computational budget request from full parameter fine-tuning. The CAP guides the purification process through the unlearnable edge detection operator calculated by the input image as an extra prompt, effectively preventing the purified images from deviating from their original appearance when large purification steps are used. Our experimental results on ImageNet showcase OSCP's superior performance, achieving a 74.19% defense success rate with merely 0.1s per purification -- a 100-fold speedup compared to conventional approaches.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[A consistent diffuse-interface finite element approach to rapid melt--vapor dynamics with application to metal additive manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18781v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal additive manufacturing via laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) faces performance-critical challenges due to complex melt pool and vapor dynamics, often oversimplified by computational models that neglect crucial aspects, such as vapor jet formation. To address this limitation, we propose a consistent computational multi-physics mesoscale model to study melt pool dynamics, laser-induced evaporation, and vapor flow. In addition to the evaporation-induced pressure jump, we also resolve the evaporation-induced volume expansion and the resulting velocity jump at the liquid--vapor interface. We use an anisothermal incompressible Navier--Stokes solver extended by a conservative diffuse level-set framework and integrate it into a matrix-free adaptive finite element framework. To ensure accurate physical solutions despite extreme density, pressure and velocity gradients across the diffuse liquid--vapor interface, we employ consistent interface source term formulations developed in our previous work. These formulations consider projection operations to extend solution variables from the sharp liquid--vapor interface into the computational domain. Benchmark examples, including film boiling, confirm the accuracy and versatility of the model. As a key result, we demonstrate the model's ability to capture the strong coupling between melt and vapor flow dynamics in PBF-LB/M based on simulations of stationary laser illumination on a metal plate. Additionally, we show the derivation of the well-known Anisimov model and extend it to a new hybrid model. This hybrid model, together with consistent interface source term formulations, especially for the level-set transport velocity, enables PBF-LB/M simulations that combine accurate physical results with the robustness of an incompressible, diffuse-interface computational modeling framework.</p></details> | 44 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Uni-3DAR: Unified 3D Generation and Understanding via Autoregression on Compressed Spatial Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16278v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models and their multi-modal extensions have demonstrated the effectiveness of unifying generation and understanding through autoregressive next-token prediction. However, despite the critical role of 3D structural generation and understanding (3D GU) in AI for science, these tasks have largely evolved independently, with autoregressive methods remaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-3DAR, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates 3D GU tasks via autoregressive prediction. At its core, Uni-3DAR employs a novel hierarchical tokenization that compresses 3D space using an octree, leveraging the inherent sparsity of 3D structures. It then applies an additional tokenization for fine-grained structural details, capturing key attributes such as atom types and precise spatial coordinates in microscopic 3D structures. We further propose two optimizations to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The first is a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. The second is a masked next-token prediction mechanism tailored for dynamically varying token positions, significantly boosting model performance. By combining these strategies, Uni-3DAR successfully unifies diverse 3D GU tasks within a single autoregressive framework. Extensive experiments across multiple microscopic 3D GU tasks, including molecules, proteins, polymers, and crystals, validate its effectiveness and versatility.

| **[Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation Based on Hierarchical Feature-Guided Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09782v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has received widespread attention because of its capability to train without ground truth. In real-world scenarios, the images may be blurry or noisy due to the influence of weather conditions and inherent limitations of the camera. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop a robust depth estimation model. Benefiting from the training strategies of generative networks, generative-based methods often exhibit enhanced robustness. In light of this, we employ the generative-based diffusion model with a unique denoising training process for self-supervised monocular depth estimation. Additionally, to further enhance the robustness of the diffusion model, we probe into the influence of perturbations on image features and propose a hierarchical feature-guided denoising module. Furthermore, we explore the implicit depth within reprojection and design an implicit depth consistency loss. This loss function is not interfered by the other subnetwork, which can be targeted to constrain the depth estimation network and ensure the scale consistency of depth within a video sequence. We conduct experiments on the KITTI and Make3D datasets. The results indicate that our approach stands out among generative-based models, while also showcasing remarkable robustness.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically rely on vision-language models like CLIP, but often exhibit limited sensitivity to text prompts. We present T2ICount, a diffusion-based framework that leverages rich prior knowledge and fine-grained visual understanding from pretrained diffusion models. While one-step denoising ensures efficiency, it leads to weakened text sensitivity. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic Correction Module that progressively refines text-image feature alignment, and a Representational Regional Coherence Loss that provides reliable supervision signals by leveraging the cross-attention maps extracted from the denosing U-Net. Furthermore, we observe that current benchmarks mainly focus on majority objects in images, potentially masking models' text sensitivity. To address this, we contribute a challenging re-annotated subset of FSC147 for better evaluation of text-guided counting ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across different benchmarks.

Instead of utilizing range images or bird's eye view (BEV) images, we represent both LiDAR and 4D radar point clouds using voxel features, which more effectively capture 3D shape information. Subsequently, we propose the Latent Voxel Diffusion Model (LVDM), which performs the diffusion process in the latent space. Additionally, a novel Latent Point Cloud Reconstruction (LPCR) module is utilized to reconstruct point clouds from high-dimensional latent voxel features. As a result, R2LDM effectively generates LiDAR-like point clouds from paired raw radar data. We evaluate our approach on two different datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves 6- to 10-fold densification of radar point clouds, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in 4D radar point cloud super-resolution. Furthermore, the enhanced radar point clouds generated by our method significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving up to 31.7% improvement in point cloud registration recall rate and 24.9% improvement in object detection accuracy.</p></details> |  |

We propose the integrated q-function in decoupled form (decoupled Iq-function) from the representative agent's perspective and establish its martingale characterization, which provides a unified policy evaluation rule for both mean-field game (MFG) and mean-field control (MFC) problems. Moreover, we consider the learning procedure where the representative agent updates the population distribution based on his own state values. Depending on the task to solve the MFG or MFC problem, we can employ the decoupled Iq-function differently to characterize the mean-field equilibrium policy or the mean-field optimal policy respectively. Based on these theoretical findings, we devise a unified q-learning algorithm for both MFG and MFC problems by utilizing test policies and the averaged martingale orthogonality condition. For several financial applications in the jump-diffusion setting, we obtain the exact parameterization of the decoupled Iq-functions and the value functions, and illustrate our q-learning algorithm with satisfactory performance.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, these strategies fail to generalize to novel styles and have technical constraints, particularly in terms of maximum output length and training efficiency. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose a novel framework for text image generation, dubbed Emuru. Our approach leverages a powerful text image representation model (a variational autoencoder) combined with an autoregressive Transformer. Our approach enables the generation of styled text images conditioned on textual content and style examples, such as specific fonts or handwriting styles. We train our model solely on a diverse, synthetic dataset of English text rendered in over 100,000 typewritten and calligraphy fonts, which gives it the capability to reproduce unseen styles (both fonts and users' handwriting) in zero-shot. To the best of our knowledge, Emuru is the first autoregressive model for HTG, and the first designed specifically for generalization to novel styles. Moreover, our model generates images without background artifacts, which are easier to use for downstream applications. Extensive evaluation on both typewritten and handwritten, any-length text image generation scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | Accepted at CVPR2025 |

However, the computationally intensive sampling steps associated with diffusion models hinder their practicality in real-world applications. Hence, we present DIDiffGes, for a Decoupled Semi-Implicit Diffusion model-based framework, that can synthesize high-quality, expressive gestures from speech using only a few sampling steps. Our approach leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enable large-step sampling for diffusion model. We decouple gesture data into body and hands distributions and further decompose them into marginal and conditional distributions. GANs model the marginal distribution implicitly, while L2 reconstruction loss learns the conditional distributions exciplictly. This strategy enhances GAN training stability and ensures expressiveness of generated full-body gestures. Our framework also learns to denoise root noise conditioned on local body representation, guaranteeing stability and realism. DIDiffGes can generate gestures from speech with just 10 sampling steps, without compromising quality and expressiveness, reducing the number of sampling steps by a factor of 100 compared to existing methods. Our user study reveals that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in human likeness, appropriateness, and style correctness.

However, these models sometimes fail to accurately capture all the details specified in the input prompts, particularly concerning entities, attributes, and spatial relationships. This issue becomes more pronounced when the prompt contains novel or complex compositions, leading to what are known as compositional generation failure modes. Recently, a new open-source diffusion-based T2I model, FLUX, has been introduced, demonstrating strong performance in high-quality image generation. Additionally, autoregressive T2I models like LlamaGen have claimed competitive visual quality performance compared to diffusion-based models. In this study, we evaluate the compositional generation capabilities of these newly introduced models against established models using the T2I-CompBench benchmark. Our findings reveal that LlamaGen, as a vanilla autoregressive model, is not yet on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models for compositional generation tasks under the same criteria, such as model size and inference time. On the other hand, the open-source diffusion-based model FLUX exhibits compositional generation capabilities comparable to the state-of-the-art closed-source model DALL-E3.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Compositional Learning: Perspectives, Methods, and Paths Forward</p></details> |

Utilizing synthetically generated images could offer a valuable alternative. In this work, we explore adapting text-to-image generative models for the surgical domain using the CholecT50 dataset, which provides surgical images annotated with action triplets (instrument, verb, target). We investigate several language models and find T5 to offer more distinct features for differentiating surgical actions on triplet-based textual inputs, and showcasing stronger alignment between long and triplet-based captions. To address challenges in training text-to-image models solely on triplet-based captions without additional inputs and supervisory signals, we discover that triplet text embeddings are instrument-centric in the latent space. Leveraging this insight, we design an instrument-based class balancing technique to counteract data imbalance and skewness, improving training convergence. Extending Imagen, a diffusion-based generative model, we develop Surgical Imagen to generate photorealistic and activity-aligned surgical images from triplet-based textual prompts. We assess the model on quality, alignment, reasoning, and knowledge, achieving FID and CLIP scores of 3.7 and 26.8% respectively. Human expert survey shows that participants were highly challenged by the realistic characteristics of the generated samples, demonstrating Surgical Imagen's effectiveness as a practical alternative to real data collection.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables, published in Pattern Recognition Letters 2025, project page at https://camma-public.github.io/endogen/</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we introduce VCtrl (also termed PP-VCtrl), a novel framework designed to enable fine-grained control over pre-trained video diffusion models in a unified manner. VCtrl integrates diverse user-specified control signals-such as Canny edges, segmentation masks, and human keypoints-into pretrained video diffusion models via a generalizable conditional module capable of uniformly encoding multiple types of auxiliary signals without modifying the underlying generator. Additionally, we design a unified control signal encoding pipeline and a sparse residual connection mechanism to efficiently incorporate control representations. Comprehensive experiments and human evaluations demonstrate that VCtrl effectively enhances controllability and generation quality.

While consistency models offer a promising approach for one-step generation, they often suffer from training instability and performance degradation when applied to policy learning. In this paper, we present CPQE (Consistency Policy with Q-Ensembles), which combines consistency models with Q-ensembles to address these challenges.CPQE leverages uncertainty estimation through Q-ensembles to provide more reliable value function approximations, resulting in better training stability and improved performance compared to classic double Q-network methods. Our extensive experiments across multiple game scenarios demonstrate that CPQE achieves inference speeds of up to 60 Hz -- a significant improvement over state-of-the-art diffusion policies that operate at only 20 Hz -- while maintaining comparable performance to multi-step diffusion approaches. CPQE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art consistency model approaches, showing both higher rewards and enhanced training stability throughout the learning process. These results indicate that CPQE offers a practical solution for deploying diffusion-based policies in games and other real-time applications where both multi-modal behavior modeling and rapid inference are critical requirements.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion-based models have demonstrated promising performance, they exhibit two key limitations for interaction synthesis: reliance on complex noise-to-reaction generators with intricate conditional mechanisms, and frequent physical violations in generated motions. To address these issues, we propose Action-Reaction Flow Matching (ARFlow), a novel framework that establishes direct action-to-reaction mappings, eliminating the need for complex conditional mechanisms. Our approach introduces two key innovations: an x1-prediction method that directly outputs human motions instead of velocity fields, enabling explicit constraint enforcement; and a training-free, gradient-based physical guidance mechanism that effectively prevents body penetration artifacts during sampling. Extensive experiments on NTU120 and Chi3D datasets demonstrate that ARFlow not only outperforms existing methods in terms of Fr\'echet Inception Distance and motion diversity but also significantly reduces body collisions, as measured by our new Intersection Volume and Intersection Frequency metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compu...</summary><p>Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)</p></details> |

However, their performance is upper-bounded by constrained 3D priors due to the lack of scalable learning paradigms. In this work, we present See3D, a visual-conditional multi-view diffusion model trained on large-scale Internet videos for open-world 3D creation. The model aims to Get 3D knowledge by solely Seeing the visual contents from the vast and rapidly growing video data -- You See it, You Got it. To achieve this, we first scale up the training data using a proposed data curation pipeline that automatically filters out multi-view inconsistencies and insufficient observations from source videos. This results in a high-quality, richly diverse, large-scale dataset of multi-view images, termed WebVi3D, containing 320M frames from 16M video clips. Nevertheless, learning generic 3D priors from videos without explicit 3D geometry or camera pose annotations is nontrivial, and annotating poses for web-scale videos is prohibitively expensive. To eliminate the need for pose conditions, we introduce an innovative visual-condition - a purely 2D-inductive visual signal generated by adding time-dependent noise to the masked video data. Finally, we introduce a novel visual-conditional 3D generation framework by integrating See3D into a warping-based pipeline for high-fidelity 3D generation. Our numerical and visual comparisons on single and sparse reconstruction benchmarks show that See3D, trained on cost-effective and scalable video data, achieves notable zero-shot and open-world generation capabilities, markedly outperforming models trained on costly and constrained 3D datasets.

The production of multi-instance 2D line art colorization adheres to an industry-standard workflow, which consists of three crucial stages: the design of line art characters, the coloring of individual objects, and the refinement process. The artists are required to repeat the process of coloring each instance one by one, which is inaccurate and inefficient. Meanwhile, current generative methods fail to solve this task due to the challenge of multi-instance pair data collection. To tackle these challenges, we incorporate three technical designs to ensure precise character detail transcription and achieve multi-instance sketch colorization in a single forward. Specifically, we first propose the self-play training strategy to solve the lack of training data. Then we introduce an instance guider to feed the color of the instance. To achieve accurate color matching, we present fine-grained color matching with edge loss to enhance visual quality. Equipped with the proposed modules, MagicColor enables automatically transforming sketches into vividly-colored images with accurate consistency and multi-instance control. Experiments on our collected datasets show that our model outperforms existing methods regarding chromatic precision. Specifically, our model critically automates the colorization process with zero manual adjustments, so novice users can produce stylistically consistent artwork by providing reference instances and the original line art.

However, current diffusion-based methods struggle with fine-grained style customization due to challenges in controlling multiple style attributes, such as color and texture. This paper introduces the first tuning-free approach to achieve free-lunch color-texture disentanglement in stylized T2I generation, addressing the need for independently controlled style elements for the Disentangled Stylized Image Generation (DisIG) problem. Our approach leverages the Image-Prompt Additivity property in the CLIP image embedding space to develop techniques for separating and extracting Color-Texture Embeddings (CTE) from individual color and texture reference images. To ensure that the color palette of the generated image aligns closely with the color reference, we apply a whitening and coloring transformation to enhance color consistency. Additionally, to prevent texture loss due to the signal-leak bias inherent in diffusion training, we introduce a noise term that preserves textural fidelity during the Regularized Whitening and Coloring Transformation (RegWCT). Through these methods, our Style Attributes Disentanglement approach (SADis) delivers a more precise and customizable solution for stylized image generation. Experiments on images from the WikiArt and StyleDrop datasets demonstrate that, both qualitatively and quantitatively, SADis surpasses state-of-the-art stylization methods in the DisIG task.Code will be released at https://deepffff.github.io/sadis.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be available at https://deepffff.github.io/sadis.github.io/</p></details> |

Despite human hand synthesis already being an intricate problem, generating objects in contact with hands and their interactions presents an even more challenging task, especially when the objects exhibit obvious variations in size and shape. To cope with these issues, we present a novel video Reenactment framework focusing on Human-Object Interaction (HOI) via an adaptive Layout-instructed Diffusion model (Re-HOLD). Our key insight is to employ specialized layout representation for hands and objects, respectively. Such representations enable effective disentanglement of hand modeling and object adaptation to diverse motion sequences. To further improve the generation quality of HOI, we have designed an interactive textural enhancement module for both hands and objects by introducing two independent memory banks. We also propose a layout-adjusting strategy for the cross-object reenactment scenario to adaptively adjust unreasonable layouts caused by diverse object sizes during inference. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods.

This paper explores the critical role of preference data in the training process of diffusion models, particularly in the context of Diffusion-DPO and its subsequent adaptations. We investigate the complexities surrounding universal human preferences in image generation, highlighting the subjective nature of these preferences and the challenges posed by minority samples in preference datasets. Through pilot experiments, we demonstrate the existence of minority samples and their detrimental effects on model performance. We propose Adaptive-DPO -- a novel approach that incorporates a minority-instance-aware metric into the DPO objective. This metric, which includes intra-annotator confidence and inter-annotator stability, distinguishes between majority and minority samples. We introduce an Adaptive-DPO loss function which improves the DPO loss in two ways: enhancing the model's learning of majority labels while mitigating the negative impact of minority samples. Our experiments demonstrate that this method effectively handles both synthetic minority data and real-world preference data, paving the way for more effective training methodologies in image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Text to Image in Diffusion Models is Easier Than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08250v3)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly improved text-image alignment, some residual misalignment between text and image representations still remains. Although many approaches have attempted to address this issue by fine-tuning models using various reward models, etc., we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages both positive and negative pairs. To achieve this efficiently even with pretrained models, we introduce a lightweight contrastive fine tuning strategy called SoftREPA that uses soft text tokens. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.</p></details> |  |

Our approach integrates classical integration-by-parts techniques with modern tools, such as Bismut's formula and Malliavin calculus, to address linear and nonlinear SDEs. In doing so, we establish a rigorous connection between the Malliavin derivative, its adjoint (the Malliavin divergence or the Skorokhod integral), Bismut's formula, and diffusion generative models, thus providing a systematic method for computing $\nabla \log p_t(x)$. For the linear case, we present a detailed study proving that our formula is equivalent to the actual score function derived from the solution of the Fokker--Planck equation for linear SDEs. Additionally, we derive a closed-form expression for $\nabla \log p_t(x)$ for nonlinear SDEs with state-independent diffusion coefficients. These advancements provide fresh theoretical insights into the smoothness and structure of probability densities and practical implications for score-based generative modelling, including the design and analysis of new diffusion models. Moreover, our findings promote the adoption of the robust Malliavin calculus framework in machine learning research. These results directly apply to various pure and applied mathematics fields, such as generative modelling, the study of SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion, and the Fokker--Planck equations associated with nonlinear SDEs.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality and generalizability of 3D content generation remain limited. State-of-the-art methods often require large-scale 3D assets for training, which are challenging to collect.

The normal maps are then used to reconstruct a 3D mesh, and the multi-view images provide texture mapping, resulting in a complete 3D model. This simple method effectively transforms the 3D generation problem into a 2D image generation task, maximizing the utilization of knowledge in pretrained diffusion models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our Kiss3DGen model is compatible with various diffusion model techniques, enabling advanced features such as 3D editing, mesh and texture enhancement, etc. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its ability to produce high-quality 3D models efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

| **[Diffusion Attribution Score: Evaluating Training Data Influence in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18639v4)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As diffusion models become increasingly popular, the misuse of copyrighted and private images has emerged as a major concern. One promising solution to mitigate this issue is identifying the contribution of specific training samples in generative models, a process known as data attribution. Existing data attribution methods for diffusion models typically quantify the contribution of a training sample by evaluating the change in diffusion loss when the sample is included or excluded from the training process. However, we argue that the direct usage of diffusion loss cannot represent such a contribution accurately due to the calculation of diffusion loss. Specifically, these approaches measure the divergence between predicted and ground truth distributions, which leads to an indirect comparison between the predicted distributions and cannot represent the variances between model behaviors. To address these issues, we aim to measure the direct comparison between predicted distributions with an attribution score to analyse the training sample importance, which is achieved by Diffusion Attribution Score (\textit{DAS}). Underpinned by rigorous theoretical analysis, we elucidate the effectiveness of DAS. Additionally, we explore strategies to accelerate DAS calculations, facilitating its application to large-scale diffusion models. Our extensive experiments across various datasets and diffusion models demonstrate that DAS significantly surpasses previous benchmarks in terms of the linear data-modelling score, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

We also propose a multi-modal finetuning method of a pretrained motion diffusion model called PersonaBooth. PersonaBooth addresses two main challenges: i) A significant distribution gap between the persona-focused PerMo dataset and the pretraining datasets, which lack persona-specific data, and ii) the difficulty of capturing a consistent persona from the motions vary in content (action type). To tackle the dataset distribution gap, we introduce a persona token to accept new persona features and perform multi-modal adaptation for both text and visuals during finetuning. To capture a consistent persona, we incorporate a contrastive learning technique to enhance intra-cohesion among samples with the same persona. Furthermore, we introduce a context-aware fusion mechanism to maximize the integration of persona cues from multiple input motions. PersonaBooth outperforms state-of-the-art motion style transfer methods, establishing a new benchmark for motion personalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe and Reliable Diffusion Models via Subspace Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16835v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have revolutionized image generation, enabling the synthesis of highly detailed visuals from textual descriptions. However, these models may inadvertently generate inappropriate content, such as copyrighted works or offensive images. While existing methods attempt to eliminate specific unwanted concepts, they often fail to ensure complete removal, allowing the concept to reappear in subtle forms. For instance, a model may successfully avoid generating images in Van Gogh's style when explicitly prompted with 'Van Gogh', yet still reproduce his signature artwork when given the prompt 'Starry Night'. In this paper, we propose SAFER, a novel and efficient approach for thoroughly removing target concepts from diffusion models. At a high level, SAFER is inspired by the observed low-dimensional structure of the text embedding space. The method first identifies a concept-specific subspace $S_c$ associated with the target concept c. It then projects the prompt embeddings onto the complementary subspace of $S_c$, effectively erasing the concept from the generated images. Since concepts can be abstract and difficult to fully capture using natural language alone, we employ textual inversion to learn an optimized embedding of the target concept from a reference image. This enables more precise subspace estimation and enhances removal performance. Furthermore, we introduce a subspace expansion strategy to ensure comprehensive and robust concept erasure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAFER consistently and effectively erases unwanted concepts from diffusion models while preserving generation quality.</p></details> |  |

Compared to its predecessor SV4D, SV4D 2.0 is more robust to occlusions and large motion, generalizes better to real-world videos, and produces higher-quality outputs in terms of detail sharpness and spatio-temporal consistency. We achieve this by introducing key improvements in multiple aspects: 1) network architecture: eliminating the dependency of reference multi-views and designing blending mechanism for 3D and frame attention, 2) data: enhancing quality and quantity of training data, 3) training strategy: adopting progressive 3D-4D training for better generalization, and 4) 4D optimization: handling 3D inconsistency and large motion via 2-stage refinement and progressive frame sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gain by SV4D 2.0 both visually and quantitatively, achieving better detail (-14\% LPIPS) and 4D consistency (-44\% FV4D) in novel-view video synthesis and 4D optimization (-12\% LPIPS and -24\% FV4D) compared to SV4D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sv4d20.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Auto-Regressive Diffusion for Generating 3D Human-Object Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16801v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven Human-Object Interaction (Text-to-HOI) generation is an emerging field with applications in animation, video games, virtual reality, and robotics. A key challenge in HOI generation is maintaining interaction consistency in long sequences. Existing Text-to-Motion-based approaches, such as discrete motion tokenization, cannot be directly applied to HOI generation due to limited data in this domain and the complexity of the modality. To address the problem of interaction consistency in long sequences, we propose an autoregressive diffusion model (ARDHOI) that predicts the next continuous token. Specifically, we introduce a Contrastive Variational Autoencoder (cVAE) to learn a physically plausible space of continuous HOI tokens, thereby ensuring that generated human-object motions are realistic and natural. For generating sequences autoregressively, we develop a Mamba-based context encoder to capture and maintain consistent sequential actions. Additionally, we implement an MLP-based denoiser to generate the subsequent token conditioned on the encoded context. Our model has been evaluated on the OMOMO and BEHAVE datasets, where it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both performance and inference speed. This makes ARDHOI a robust and efficient solution for text-driven HOI tasks</p></details> |  |

Then we propose a Dual-Level Control mechanism for incorporating regional cues at both feature and latent levels, offering fine-grained control for more precise edits. To fully compare our methods with other DiT-based approaches, we construct the RW-800 benchmark, featuring high resolution images, long descriptive texts, real-world images, and a new text editing task. Experimental results on the popular PIE-Bench and RW-800 benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in preserving background and providing accurate edits.</p></details> |  |

Recently, various fundamental deep learning architectures such as MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and GNNs have been developed and applied to solve time series forecasting problems. However, the structural limitations caused by the inductive biases of each deep learning architecture constrained their performance. Transformer models, which excel at handling long-term dependencies, have become significant architectural components for time series forecasting. However, recent research has shown that alternatives such as simple linear layers can outperform Transformers. These findings have opened up new possibilities for using diverse architectures.

| **[UVGS: Reimagining Unstructured 3D Gaussian Splatting using UV Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01846v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated superior quality in modeling 3D objects and scenes. However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://aashishrai3799.github.io/uvgs</p></details> |

However, the quadratic scaling properties of the attention in DiTs hinder image generation with higher resolution or on devices with limited resources. This work introduces an efficient diffusion transformer (EDiT) to alleviate these efficiency bottlenecks in conventional DiTs and Multimodal DiTs (MM-DiTs). First, we present a novel linear compressed attention method that uses a multi-layer convolutional network to modulate queries with local information while keys and values are spatially aggregated. Second, we formulate a hybrid attention scheme for multi-modal inputs that combines linear attention for image-to-image interactions and standard scaled dot-product attention for interactions involving prompts. Merging these two approaches leads to an expressive, linear-time Multimodal Efficient Diffusion Transformer (MM-EDiT). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the EDiT and MM-EDiT architectures by integrating them into PixArt-Sigma(conventional DiT) and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Medium (MM-DiT), achieving up to 2.2x speedup with comparable image quality after distillation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAD-AD: Masked Diffusion for Unsupervised Brain Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16943v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection in brain images is crucial for identifying injuries and pathologies without access to labels. However, the accurate localization of anomalies in medical images remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and variability of brain structures and the scarcity of annotated abnormal data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that incorporates masking within diffusion models, leveraging their generative capabilities to learn robust representations of normal brain anatomy. During training, our model processes only normal brain MRI scans and performs a forward diffusion process in the latent space that adds noise to the features of randomly-selected patches. Following a dual objective, the model learns to identify which patches are noisy and recover their original features. This strategy ensures that the model captures intricate patterns of normal brain structures while isolating potential anomalies as noise in the latent space. At inference, the model identifies noisy patches corresponding to anomalies and generates a normal counterpart for these patches by applying a reverse diffusion process. Our method surpasses existing unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, demonstrating superior performance in generating accurate normal counterparts and localizing anomalies.

In this paper, we propose Cross-modal and Uncertainty-aware Agglomeration for Open-vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding dubbed CUA-O3D, the first model to integrate multiple foundation models-such as CLIP, DINOv2, and Stable Diffusion-into 3D scene understanding. We further introduce a deterministic uncertainty estimation to adaptively distill and harmonize the heterogeneous 2D feature embeddings from these models. Our method addresses two key challenges: (1) incorporating semantic priors from VLMs alongside the geometric knowledge of spatially-aware vision foundation models, and (2) using a novel deterministic uncertainty estimation to capture model-specific uncertainties across diverse semantic and geometric sensitivities, helping to reconcile heterogeneous representations during training. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and Matterport3D demonstrate that our method not only advances open-vocabulary segmentation but also achieves robust cross-domain alignment and competitive spatial perception capabilities.

However, directly applying flow matching to neural vocoders can result in subpar audio quality. In this work, we present WaveFM, a reparameterized flow matching model for mel-spectrogram conditioned speech synthesis, designed to enhance both sample quality and generation speed for diffusion vocoders. Since mel-spectrograms represent the energy distribution of waveforms, WaveFM adopts a mel-conditioned prior distribution instead of a standard Gaussian prior to minimize unnecessary transportation costs during synthesis. Moreover, while most diffusion vocoders rely on a single loss function, we argue that incorporating auxiliary losses, including a refined multi-resolution STFT loss, can further improve audio quality. To speed up inference without degrading sample quality significantly, we introduce a tailored consistency distillation method for WaveFM. Experiment results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance in both quality and efficiency compared to previous diffusion vocoders, while enabling waveform generation in a single inference step.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of NAACL 2025.

As physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have successfully applied to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by incorporating physical constraints into neural architectures, this work investigates whether quantum-classical physics-informed neural networks (QCPINNs) can efficiently solve PDEs with reduced parameter counts compared to classical approaches. We evaluate two quantum circuit paradigms: continuous-variable (CV) and qubit-based discrete-variable (DV) across multiple circuit ansatze (Alternate, Cascade, Cross mesh, and Layered). Benchmarking across five challenging PDEs (Helmholtz, Cavity, Wave, Klein-Gordon, and Convection-Diffusion equations) demonstrates that our hybrid approaches achieve comparable accuracy to classical PINNs while requiring up to 89% fewer trainable parameters. DV-based implementations, particularly those with angle encoding and cascade circuit configurations, exhibit better stability and convergence properties across all problem types. For the Convection-Diffusion equation, our angle-cascade QCPINN achieves parameter efficiency and a 37% reduction in relative L2 error compared to classical counterparts. Our findings highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced architectures for physics-informed learning, establishing parameter efficiency as a quantifiable quantum advantage while providing a foundation for future quantum-classical hybrid systems solving complex physical models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fed-NDIF: A Noise-Embedded Federated Diffusion Model For Low-Count Whole-Body PET Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16635v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-count positron emission tomography (LCPET) imaging can reduce patients' exposure to radiation but often suffers from increased image noise and reduced lesion detectability, necessitating effective denoising techniques. Diffusion models have shown promise in LCPET denoising for recovering degraded image quality. However, training such models requires large and diverse datasets, which are challenging to obtain in the medical domain. To address data scarcity and privacy concerns, we combine diffusion models with federated learning -- a decentralized training approach where models are trained individually at different sites, and their parameters are aggregated on a central server over multiple iterations. The variation in scanner types and image noise levels within and across institutions poses additional challenges for federated learning in LCPET denoising. In this study, we propose a novel noise-embedded federated learning diffusion model (Fed-NDIF) to address these challenges, leveraging a multicenter dataset and varying count levels. Our approach incorporates liver normalized standard deviation (NSTD) noise embedding into a 2.5D diffusion model and utilizes the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm to aggregate locally trained models into a global model, which is subsequently fine-tuned on local datasets to optimize performance and obtain personalized models. Extensive validation on datasets from the University of Bern, Ruijin Hospital in Shanghai, and Yale-New Haven Hospital demonstrates the superior performance of our method in enhancing image quality and improving lesion quantification. The Fed-NDIF model shows significant improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE of the entire 3D volume, as well as enhanced lesion detectability and quantification, compared to local diffusion models and federated UNet-based models.</p></details> |  |

Using an efficient triplane-based architecture, our method enables semantic-aware texture transfer to a novel target mesh. Despite training on just one example, it generalizes effectively to diverse shapes within the same category. Extensive evaluation on our newly created benchmark dataset shows that \ourmethod{} achieves superior texture transfer quality and fast inference times compared to existing methods.

This approach requires minimal training and uses existing generative models. Our process involves two steps: generating coherent panoramas using a pre-trained diffusion model and lifting these into 3D with a metric depth estimator. We then fill unobserved regions by conditioning the inpainting model on rendered point clouds, requiring minimal fine-tuning. Tested on both synthetic and real images, our method produces high-quality 3D environments suitable for VR display. By explicitly modeling the 3D structure of the generated environment from the start, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art, video synthesis-based methods along multiple quantitative image quality metrics.

However, existing methods often focus on limited domains, require time-consuming optimization per subject, or support only a single subject. We present Video Alchemist $-$ a video model with built-in multi-subject, open-set personalization capabilities for both foreground objects and background, eliminating the need for time-consuming test-time optimization. Our model is built on a new Diffusion Transformer module that fuses each conditional reference image and its corresponding subject-level text prompt with cross-attention layers. Developing such a large model presents two main challenges: dataset and evaluation. First, as paired datasets of reference images and videos are extremely hard to collect, we sample selected video frames as reference images and synthesize a clip of the target video. However, while models can easily denoise training videos given reference frames, they fail to generalize to new contexts. To mitigate this issue, we design a new automatic data construction pipeline with extensive image augmentations. Second, evaluating open-set video personalization is a challenge in itself. To address this, we introduce a personalization benchmark that focuses on accurate subject fidelity and supports diverse personalization scenarios. Finally, our extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing personalization methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Unlike conventional methods that serialize images into fixed-position latent codes with a uniform compression ratio, we introduce an unordered token set representation to dynamically allocate coding capacity based on regional semantic complexity. This TokenSet enhances global context aggregation and improves robustness against local perturbations. To address the critical challenge of modeling discrete sets, we devise a dual transformation mechanism that bijectively converts sets into fixed-length integer sequences with summation constraints. Further, we propose Fixed-Sum Discrete Diffusion--the first framework to simultaneously handle discrete values, fixed sequence length, and summation invariance--enabling effective set distribution modeling. Experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in semantic-aware representation and generation quality. Our innovations, spanning novel representation and modeling strategies, advance visual generation beyond traditional sequential token paradigms.

We introduce InfiniteYou (InfU), one of the earliest robust frameworks leveraging DiTs for this task. InfU addresses significant issues of existing methods, such as insufficient identity similarity, poor text-image alignment, and low generation quality and aesthetics. Central to InfU is InfuseNet, a component that injects identity features into the DiT base model via residual connections, enhancing identity similarity while maintaining generation capabilities. A multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic single-person-multiple-sample (SPMS) data, further improves text-image alignment, ameliorates image quality, and alleviates face copy-pasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfU achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines.

| **[ScalingNoise: Scaling Inference-Time Search for Generating Infinite Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16400v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models (VDMs) facilitate the generation of high-quality videos, with current research predominantly concentrated on scaling efforts during training through improvements in data quality, computational resources, and model complexity. However, inference-time scaling has received less attention, with most approaches restricting models to a single generation attempt. Recent studies have uncovered the existence of "golden noises" that can enhance video quality during generation. Building on this, we find that guiding the scaling inference-time search of VDMs to identify better noise candidates not only evaluates the quality of the frames generated in the current step but also preserves the high-level object features by referencing the anchor frame from previous multi-chunks, thereby delivering long-term value. Our analysis reveals that diffusion models inherently possess flexible adjustments of computation by varying denoising steps, and even a one-step denoising approach, when guided by a reward signal, yields significant long-term benefits. Based on the observation, we proposeScalingNoise, a plug-and-play inference-time search strategy that identifies golden initial noises for the diffusion sampling process to improve global content consistency and visual diversity. Specifically, we perform one-step denoising to convert initial noises into a clip and subsequently evaluate its long-term value, leveraging a reward model anchored by previously generated content. Moreover, to preserve diversity, we sample candidates from a tilted noise distribution that up-weights promising noises. In this way, ScalingNoise significantly reduces noise-induced errors, ensuring more coherent and spatiotemporally consistent video generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed ScalingNoise effectively improves long video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scale-wise Distillation of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16397v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SwD, a scale-wise distillation framework for diffusion models (DMs), which effectively employs next-scale prediction ideas for diffusion-based few-step generators. In more detail, SwD is inspired by the recent insights relating diffusion processes to the implicit spectral autoregression. We suppose that DMs can initiate generation at lower data resolutions and gradually upscale the samples at each denoising step without loss in performance while significantly reducing computational costs. SwD naturally integrates this idea into existing diffusion distillation methods based on distribution matching. Also, we enrich the family of distribution matching approaches by introducing a novel patch loss enforcing finer-grained similarity to the target distribution. When applied to state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models, SwD approaches the inference times of two full resolution steps and significantly outperforms the counterparts under the same computation budget, as evidenced by automated metrics and human preference studies.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we study if visual representations of sub-goals implied by the instructions can serve as navigational cues and lead to increased navigation performance. To synthesize these visual representations or imaginations, we leverage a text-to-image diffusion model on landmark references contained in segmented instructions. These imaginations are provided to VLN agents as an added modality to act as landmark cues and an auxiliary loss is added to explicitly encourage relating these with their corresponding referring expressions. Our findings reveal an increase in success rate (SR) of around 1 point and up to 0.5 points in success scaled by inverse path length (SPL) across agents. These results suggest that the proposed approach reinforces visual understanding compared to relying on language instructions alone.

This framework enables the construction of comprehensive, high-quality paired visible and thermal images using captions generated by LLMs. Our method encompasses three parts: visible image synthesis with ArcFace embedding, thermal image translation using Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), and caption generation with LLMs. Our approach not only generates multi-view paired visible and thermal images to increase data diversity but also produces high-quality paired data while maintaining their identity information. We evaluate our method on public datasets by comparing it with existing methods, demonstrating the superiority of LaPIG.</p></details> |  |

Unlike indoor scene generation, which has been a primary focus of prior work, outdoor scene generation presents unique challenges, including wide variations in scene heights and the need for a method capable of rapidly producing large landscapes. To address this, we propose an efficient approach that encodes scene chunks as uniform vector sets, offering better compression and performance than the spatially structured latents used in prior methods. Furthermore, we train an explicit outpainting model for unbounded generation, which improves coherence compared to prior resampling-based inpainting schemes while also speeding up generation by eliminating extra diffusion steps. To facilitate this task, we curate NuiScene43, a small but high-quality set of scenes, preprocessed for joint training. Notably, when trained on scenes of varying styles, our model can blend different environments, such as rural houses and city skyscrapers, within the same scene, highlighting the potential of our curation process to leverage heterogeneous scenes for joint training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultra-Resolution Adaptation with Ease](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16322v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, training models for high-resolution image generation remains challenging, particularly when training data and computational resources are limited. In this paper, we explore this practical problem from two key perspectives: data and parameter efficiency, and propose a set of key guidelines for ultra-resolution adaptation termed \emph{URAE}. For data efficiency, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that synthetic data generated by some teacher models can significantly promote training convergence. For parameter efficiency, we find that tuning minor components of the weight matrices outperforms widely-used low-rank adapters when synthetic data are unavailable, offering substantial performance gains while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, for models leveraging guidance distillation, such as FLUX, we show that disabling classifier-free guidance, \textit{i.e.}, setting the guidance scale to 1 during adaptation, is crucial for satisfactory performance. Extensive experiments validate that URAE achieves comparable 2K-generation performance to state-of-the-art closed-source models like FLUX1.1 [Pro] Ultra with only 3K samples and 2K iterations, while setting new benchmarks for 4K-resolution generation.

| **[Unleashing Vecset Diffusion Model for Fast Shape Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16302v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D shape generation has greatly flourished through the development of so-called "native" 3D diffusion, particularly through the Vecset Diffusion Model (VDM). While recent advancements have shown promising results in generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed generation. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a lightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of the vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply FlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic evaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D generation methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art while reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for generation.

| **[Diffusion-augmented Graph Contrastive Learning for Collaborative Filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16290v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based collaborative filtering has been established as a prominent approach in recommendation systems, leveraging the inherent graph topology of user-item interactions to model high-order connectivity patterns and enhance recommendation performance. Recent advances in Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) have demonstrated promising potential to alleviate data sparsity issues by improving representation learning through contrastive view generation and mutual information maximization. However, existing approaches lack effective data augmentation strategies. Structural augmentation risks distorting fundamental graph topology, while feature-level perturbation techniques predominantly employ uniform noise scales that fail to account for node-specific characteristics. To solve these challenges, we propose Diffusion-augmented Contrastive Learning (DGCL), an innovative framework that integrates diffusion models with contrastive learning for enhanced collaborative filtering. Our approach employs a diffusion process that learns node-specific Gaussian distributions of representations, thereby generating semantically consistent yet diversified contrastive views through reverse diffusion sampling. DGCL facilitates adaptive data augmentation based on reconstructed representations, considering both semantic coherence and node-specific features. In addition, it explores unrepresented regions of the latent sparse feature space, thereby enriching the diversity of contrastive views. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DGCL on three public datasets.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches utilizing generative modeling have made progress in this domain; however, they are limited in controllability and flexibility for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose reformulating the HSI modeling problem as Scene-aware Motion In-betweening -- a more tractable and practical task. We introduce SceneMI, a framework that supports several practical applications, including keyframe-guided character animation in 3D scenes and enhancing the motion quality of imperfect HSI data. SceneMI employs dual scene descriptors to comprehensively encode global and local scene context. Furthermore, our framework leverages the inherent denoising nature of diffusion models to generalize on noisy keyframes. Experimental results demonstrate SceneMI's effectiveness in scene-aware keyframe in-betweening and generalization to the real-world GIMO dataset, where motions and scenes are acquired by noisy IMU sensors and smartphones. We further showcase SceneMI's applicability in HSI reconstruction from monocular videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, Project page: http://inwoohwang.me/SceneMI</p></details> |
| **[Repurposing Stable Diffusion Attention for Training-Free Unsupervised Interactive Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10411v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in interactive point prompt based Image Segmentation allows to significantly reduce the manual effort to obtain high quality semantic labels. State-of-the-art unsupervised methods use self-supervised pre-trained models to obtain pseudo-labels which are used in training a prompt-based segmentation model. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised and training-free approach based solely on the self-attention of Stable Diffusion. We interpret the self-attention tensor as a Markov transition operator, which enables us to iteratively construct a Markov chain. Pixel-wise counting of the required number of iterations along the Markov chain to reach a relative probability threshold yields a Markov-iteration-map, which we simply call a Markov-map. Compared to the raw attention maps, we show that our proposed Markov-map has less noise, sharper semantic boundaries and more uniform values within semantically similar regions. We integrate the Markov-map in a simple yet effective truncated nearest neighbor framework to obtain interactive point prompt based segmentation. Despite being training-free, we experimentally show that our approach yields excellent results in terms of Number of Clicks (NoC), even outperforming state-of-the-art training based unsupervised methods in most of the datasets.

Following recent trends in supervised multimodal approaches, we carefully integrate depth as an additional modality to create novel depth-guided Markov-maps. Furthermore, we observe occasional segment size fluctuations in M2N2 during the interactive process, which can decrease the overall mIoU's. To mitigate this problem, we model the prompting as a sequential process and propose a novel adaptive score function which considers the previous segmentation and the current prompt point in order to prevent unreasonable segment size changes. Using Stable Diffusion 2 and Depth Anything V2 as backbones, we empirically show that our proposed M2N2V2 significantly improves the Number of Clicks (NoC) and mIoU compared to M2N2 in all datasets except those from the medical domain. Interestingly, our unsupervised approach achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods like SAM and SimpleClick in the more challenging DAVIS and HQSeg44K datasets in the NoC metric, reducing the gap between supervised and unsupervised methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Score Analysis for Understanding and Correcting Diffusion Artifacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16218v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual artifacts remain a persistent challenge in diffusion models, even with training on massive datasets. Current solutions primarily rely on supervised detectors, yet lack understanding of why these artifacts occur in the first place. In our analysis, we identify three distinct phases in the diffusion generative process: Profiling, Mutation, and Refinement. Artifacts typically emerge during the Mutation phase, where certain regions exhibit anomalous score dynamics over time, causing abrupt disruptions in the normal evolution pattern. This temporal nature explains why existing methods focusing only on spatial uncertainty of the final output fail at effective artifact localization. Based on these insights, we propose ASCED (Abnormal Score Correction for Enhancing Diffusion), that detects artifacts by monitoring abnormal score dynamics during the diffusion process, with a trajectory-aware on-the-fly mitigation strategy that appropriate generation of noise in the detected areas. Unlike most existing methods that apply post hoc corrections, \eg, by applying a noising-denoising scheme after generation, our mitigation strategy operates seamlessly within the existing diffusion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively reduces artifacts across diverse domains, matching or surpassing existing supervised methods without additional training.</p></details> |  |
| **[An interior penalty DG method with correct and minimal averages, jumps and penalties for the miscible displacement problem of nonnegative characteristic form, and SUPG-type error estimates under low regularity, dominating Darcy velocity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16196v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An interior penalty DG method is proposed for the steady-state linear partial differential equations of nonnegative characteristic form, suitable for mixed second-order elliptic-parabolic and first-order hyperbolic equations. Due to the different natures of the elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations. In the new DG method, the averages, jumps and penalties are minimal, correctly and only imposed on the diffusion-diffusion element boundaries, in addition to the well-known upwind jumps associating with the advection velocity. For the advection-dominated problem, the penalties can be further reduced only being imposed on the diffusion-dominated subset of the diffusion-diffusion element boundaries.This is based on the novel, crucial technique about the multiple partitions of the set of the interelement boundaries into a number of subsets with respect to the diffusion and to the advection and on the consistency result we have proven. The new DG method is the first DG method and the first time that the continuity and discontinuity of the solution are correctly identified and justified of the general steady-state linear partial differential equations of nonnegative characteristic form. The new DG method and its analysis are applied to the miscible displacement problem of vanishing diffusion coefficient and of low regularity, dominating Darcy flow velocity which lives in $H(\operatorname{div};\Omega)\cap \prod_{j=1}^J (H^r(D_j))^d$ for $r<1$ other than the usual assumption $(W^{1,\infty}(\Omega))^d$. We prove the SUPG-type error estimates $\mathcal{O}(h^{\ell+\frac{1}{2}})$ for any element polynomial of degree $\ell\ge 1$ on generally shaped and nonconforming meshes, where the convergence order is independent of the regularity of the advection velocity. The SUPG-type error estimates obtained are new and the first time known under the low regularity of the advection velocity.</p></details> |  |

However, the fundamental reliance of self-attention layers on positional embedding versus query-key similarity during generation remains an intriguing question. We present the first mechanistic analysis of RoPE-based MMDiT models (e.g., FLUX), introducing an automated probing strategy that disentangles positional information versus content dependencies by strategically manipulating RoPE during generation. Our analysis reveals distinct dependency patterns that do not straightforwardly correlate with depth, offering new insights into the layer-specific roles in RoPE-based MMDiT. Based on these findings, we propose a training-free, task-specific image editing framework that categorizes editing tasks into three types: position-dependent editing (e.g., object addition), content similarity-dependent editing (e.g., non-rigid editing), and region-preserved editing (e.g., background replacement). For each type, we design tailored key-value injection strategies based on the characteristics of the editing task. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in preserving original semantic content and achieving seamless modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wtybest.github.io/projects/FreeFlux/</p></details> |

Traditional approaches often rely on centralized orchestration to partition tasks among nodes. However, these methods struggle with communication bottlenecks, latency, and reliability when the swarm grows or the topology shifts rapidly. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fully distributed, diffusive metric-based approach for split computing in UAV swarms. Our solution introduces a new iterative measure, termed the aggregated gigaflops, capturing each node's own computing capacity along with that of its neighbors without requiring global network knowledge. By forwarding partial inferences intelligently to underutilized nodes, we achieve improved task throughput, lower latency, and enhanced energy efficiency. Further, to handle sudden workload surges and rapidly changing node conditions, we incorporate an early-exit mechanism that can adapt the inference pathway on-the-fly. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline strategies across multiple performance indices, including latency, fairness, and energy consumption. These results highlight the feasibility of large-scale distributed intelligence in UAV swarms and provide a blueprint for deploying robust, scalable ML services in diverse aerial networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to a IEEE journal for possible publication</p></details> |

The inherent privacy and commercial sensitivity of such data has encouraged a shift towards decentralised data-driven methods, such as Federated Learning (FL). Under a traditional Machine Learning paradigm, traffic flow prediction models can capture spatial and temporal relationships within centralised data. In reality, traffic data is likely distributed across separate data silos owned by multiple stakeholders. In this work, a cross-silo FL setting is motivated to facilitate stakeholder collaboration for optimal traffic flow prediction applications. This work introduces an FL framework, referred to as FedTPS, to generate synthetic data to augment each client's local dataset by training a diffusion-based trajectory generation model through FL. The proposed framework is evaluated on a large-scale real world ride-sharing dataset using various FL methods and Traffic Flow Prediction models, including a novel prediction model we introduce, which leverages Temporal and Graph Attention mechanisms to learn the Spatio-Temporal dependencies embedded within regional traffic flow data. Experimental results show that FedTPS outperforms multiple other FL baselines with respect to global model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables, ACM format</p></details> |

However, in this paper, we demonstrate that the standard implementation of this technique does not necessarily lead to a distribution closer to the real data distribution. Specifically, we show that training the discriminator using Cross-Entropy loss, as commonly done, can in fact increase the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and target distributions, particularly when the discriminator overfits. To address this, we propose a theoretically sound training objective for discriminator guidance that properly minimizes the KL divergence. We analyze its properties and demonstrate empirically across multiple datasets that our proposed method consistently improves over the conventional method by producing samples of higher quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text2Earth: Unlocking Text-driven Remote Sensing Image Generation with a Global-Scale Dataset and a Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00895v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative foundation models have advanced large-scale text-driven natural image generation, becoming a prominent research trend across various vertical domains. However, in the remote sensing field, there is still a lack of research on large-scale text-to-image (text2image) generation technology. Existing remote sensing image-text datasets are small in scale and confined to specific geographic areas and scene types. Besides, existing text2image methods have struggled to achieve global-scale, multi-resolution controllable, and unbounded image generation. To address these challenges, this paper presents two key contributions: the Git-10M dataset and the Text2Earth foundation model. Git-10M is a global-scale image-text dataset comprising 10.5 million image-text pairs, 5 times larger than the previous largest one. The dataset covers a wide range of geographic scenes and contains resolution information, significantly surpassing existing datasets in both size and diversity. Building on Git-10M, we propose Text2Earth, a 1.3 billion parameter generative foundation model based on the diffusion framework to model global-scale remote sensing scenes. Text2Earth integrates a resolution guidance mechanism, enabling users to specify image resolutions. A dynamic condition adaptation strategy is proposed for training and inference to improve image quality. Text2Earth excels in zero-shot text2image generation and demonstrates robust generalization and flexibility across multiple tasks, including unbounded scene construction, image editing, and cross-modal image generation. This robust capability surpasses previous models restricted to the basic fixed size and limited scene types. On the previous benchmark dataset, Text2Earth outperforms previous models with an improvement of +26.23 FID and +20.95% Zero-shot Cls-OA metric.Our project page is https://chen-yang-liu.github.io/Text2Earth</p></details> |  |

We start by adapting an existing next-scale prediction autoregressive (AR) architecture to T2I generation, investigating and mitigating training stability issues in the process. Next, we argue that scale-wise transformers do not require causality and propose a non-causal counterpart facilitating ~21% faster sampling and lower memory usage while also achieving slightly better generation quality. Furthermore, we reveal that classifier-free guidance at high-resolution scales is often unnecessary and can even degrade performance. By disabling guidance at these scales, we achieve an additional sampling acceleration of ~32% and improve the generation of fine-grained details. Extensive human preference studies and automated evaluations show that Switti outperforms existing T2I AR models and competes with state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models while being up to 7x faster.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Recent vision foundation models show excellent few-shot transfer abilities, but are large and slow at inference. Using knowledge distillation, the capabilities of high-performing but slow models can be transferred to tiny, efficient models. However, common distillation methods require a large set of unlabeled data, which is not available in the few-shot setting. To overcome this lack of data, there has been a recent interest in using synthetic data. We expand on this line of research by presenting a novel diffusion model inversion technique (TINT) combining the diversity of textual inversion with the specificity of null-text inversion. Using this method in a few-shot distillation pipeline leads to state-of-the-art accuracy among small student models on popular benchmarks, while being significantly faster than prior work. Popular few-shot benchmarks involve evaluation over a large number of episodes, which is computationally cumbersome for methods involving synthetic data generation. We also present a theoretical analysis on how the accuracy estimator variance depends on the number of episodes and query examples, and use these results to lower the computational effort required for method evaluation. Finally, to further motivate the use of generative models in few-shot distillation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms training on real data mined from the dataset used in the original diffusion model training.

Specifically, we propose a large-scale synthetic dataset PoseTraj-10K, containing 10k videos of objects following rotational trajectories, and enhance the model perception of object pose changes by incorporating 3D bounding boxes as intermediate supervision signals. Following this, we fine-tune the trajectory-controlling module on real-world videos, applying an additional camera-disentanglement module to further refine motion accuracy.

Due to the intricate tiny patterns and repeated geometric sub-structures in most ornaments, it is much more difficult to guarantee identity and appearance consistency under large pose and scale variances between ornaments and models. This paper proposes the task of virtual try-on for ornaments and presents a method to improve the geometric and appearance preservation of ornament virtual try-ons. Specifically, we estimate an accurate wearing mask to improve the alignments between ornaments and models in an iterative scheme alongside the denoising process. To preserve structure details, we further regularize attention layers to map the reference ornament mask to the wearing mask in an implicit way. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully wears ornaments from reference images onto target models, handling substantial differences in scale and pose while preserving identity and achieving realistic visual effects.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Race-DiT, a novel MoE model for diffusion transformers with a flexible routing strategy, Expert Race. By allowing tokens and experts to compete together and select the top candidates, the model learns to dynamically assign experts to critical tokens.

Recent efforts attempted to enhance generalization by improving the visual feature encoding for diffusion policy. However, their generalization is typically limited to the same category with similar appearances. Our key insight is that leveraging affordances--manipulation priors that define "where" and "how" an agent interacts with an object--can substantially enhance generalization to entirely unseen object instances and categories. We introduce the Diffusion Policy with transferable Affordance (AffordDP), designed for generalizable manipulation across novel categories. AffordDP models affordances through 3D contact points and post-contact trajectories, capturing the essential static and dynamic information for complex tasks. The transferable affordance from in-domain data to unseen objects is achieved by estimating a 6D transformation matrix using foundational vision models and point cloud registration techniques. More importantly, we incorporate affordance guidance during diffusion sampling that can refine action sequence generation. This guidance directs the generated action to gradually move towards the desired manipulation for unseen objects while keeping the generated action within the manifold of action space. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that AffordDP consistently outperforms previous diffusion-based methods, successfully generalizing to unseen instances and categories where others fail.</p></details> |  |

However, astrophotography presents unique challenges for deep learning due to limited training data. This work explores hybrid strategies, such as the Deep Image Prior (DIP) model, which facilitates blind training but is susceptible to overfitting, artifact generation, and instability when handling noisy images. We propose enhancements to the DIP model's baseline performance through several advanced techniques. First, we refine the model to process multiple frames concurrently, employing the Back Projection method and the TVNet model. Next, we adopt a Markov approach incorporating Monte Carlo estimation, Langevin dynamics, and a variational input technique to achieve unbiased estimates with minimal variance and counteract overfitting effectively. Collectively, these modifications reduce the likelihood of noise learning and mitigate loss function fluctuations during training, enhancing result stability. We validated our algorithm across multiple image sets of astronomical and celestial objects, achieving performance that not only mitigates limitations of Lucky Imaging, a classical computer vision technique that remains a standard in astronomical image reconstruction but surpasses the original DIP model, state of the art transformer- and diffusion-based models, underscoring the significance of our improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

To derive high-quality reconstructions through few-step inferences, we emphasize the critical issue of regularizing the learning of score function in states of random noise. To this end, we propose edge consistency, i.e., consistent predictions across the high signal-to-noise ratio region, to enhance a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling a distillation-based refinement of the endpoint score function. Building on those distilled diffusion models, we propose an adversarial augmentation strategy to further enrich the generation detail and boost overall generation quality. The two modules complement each other, mutually reinforcing to elevate generative performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Acc3D not only achieves over a $20\times$ increase in computational efficiency but also yields notable quality improvements, compared to the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAN-enhanced Simulation-driven DNN Testing in Absence of Ground Truth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15953v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of synthetic inputs via simulators driven by search algorithms is essential for cost-effective testing of Deep Neural Network (DNN) components for safety-critical systems. However, in many applications, simulators are unable to produce the ground-truth data needed for automated test oracles and to guide the search process. To tackle this issue, we propose an approach for the generation of inputs for computer vision DNNs that integrates a generative network to ensure simulator fidelity and employs heuristic-based search fitnesses that leverage transformation consistency, noise resistance, surprise adequacy, and uncertainty estimation. We compare the performance of our fitnesses with that of a traditional fitness function leveraging ground truth; further, we assess how the integration of a GAN not leveraging the ground truth impacts on test and retraining effectiveness. Our results suggest that leveraging transformation consistency is the best option to generate inputs for both DNN testing and retraining; it maximizes input diversity, spots the inputs leading to worse DNN performance, and leads to best DNN performance after retraining. Besides enabling simulator-based testing in the absence of ground truth, our findings pave the way for testing solutions that replace costly simulators with diffusion and large language models, which might be more affordable than simulators, but cannot generate ground-truth data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

While cross-attention has been well-studied in text-to-image tasks, their interpretability in image-to-image (I2I) diffusion models remains underexplored. This paper introduces Image-to-Image Attribution Maps (I2AM), a method that enhances the interpretability of I2I models by visualizing bidirectional attribution maps, from the reference image to the generated image and vice versa. I2AM aggregates cross-attention scores across time steps, attention heads, and layers, offering insights into how critical features are transferred between images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of I2AM across object detection, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks. Our results demonstrate that I2AM successfully identifies key regions responsible for generating the output, even in complex scenes. Additionally, we introduce the Inpainting Mask Attention Consistency Score (IMACS) as a novel evaluation metric to assess the alignment between attribution maps and inpainting masks, which correlates strongly with existing performance metrics. Through extensive experiments, we show that I2AM enables model debugging and refinement, providing practical tools for improving I2I model's performance and interpretability.</p></details> | 23 pages |

However, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed, primarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we propose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities at adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse methods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales, BlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar features, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features. These features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the transformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses these highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby accelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of the original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content and the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce BlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for instance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources and provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have proven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving accelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

The challenge aims to generate semantically aligned sign language pose sequences from text inputs. To this end, we propose a Text-driven Diffusion Model (TDM) framework. During the training phase, TDM utilizes an encoder to encode text sequences and incorporates them into the diffusion model as conditional input to generate sign pose sequences. To guarantee the high quality and accuracy of the generated pose sequences, we utilize two key loss functions. The joint loss function L_{joint} is used to precisely measure and minimize the differences between the joint positions of the generated pose sequences and those of the ground truth. Similarly, the bone orientation loss function L_{bone} is instrumental in ensuring that the orientation of the bones in the generated poses aligns with the actual, correct orientations. In the inference stage, the TDM framework takes on a different yet equally important task. It starts with noisy sequences and, under the strict constraints of the text conditions, gradually refines and generates semantically consistent sign language pose sequences. Our carefully designed framework performs well on the sign language production task, and our solution achieves a BLEU-1 score of 20.17, placing second in the challenge.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Previous SD-based methods are all supervised since adapting diffusion models for dense prediction requires high-precision supervision. In contrast, self-supervised reprojection suffers from inherent challenges (e.g., occlusions, texture-less regions, illumination variance), and the predictions exhibit blurs and artifacts that severely compromise SD's latent priors. To resolve this, we construct a novel surrogate task of hybrid image reconstruction. Without any additional supervision, it preserves the detail priors of SD models by reconstructing the images themselves while preventing depth estimation from degradation. Furthermore, to address the inherent misalignment between SD's scale and shift invariant estimation and self-supervised scale-invariant depth estimation, we build the Scale-Shift GRU. It not only bridges this distribution gap but also isolates the fine-grained texture of SD output against the interference of reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Jasmine achieves SoTA performance on the KITTI benchmark and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, significant challenges remain, as these models often struggle to follow complex edit instructions accurately and frequently compromise fidelity by altering key elements of the original image. Simultaneously, video generation has made remarkable strides, with models that effectively function as consistent and continuous world simulators. In this paper, we propose merging these two fields by utilizing image-to-video models for image editing. We reformulate image editing as a temporal process, using pretrained video models to create smooth transitions from the original image to the desired edit. This approach traverses the image manifold continuously, ensuring consistent edits while preserving the original image's key aspects. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on text-based image editing, demonstrating significant improvements in both edit accuracy and image preservation.

Despite this progress, seamlessly adding objects to images based on textual instructions without requiring user-provided input masks remains a challenge. We address this by leveraging the insight that removing objects (Inpaint) is significantly simpler than its inverse process of adding them (Paint), attributed to inpainting models that benefit from segmentation mask guidance. Capitalizing on this realization, by implementing an automated and extensive pipeline, we curate a filtered large-scale image dataset containing pairs of images and their corresponding object-removed versions. Using these pairs, we train a diffusion model to inverse the inpainting process, effectively adding objects into images. Unlike other editing datasets, ours features natural target images instead of synthetic ones while ensuring source-target consistency by construction. Additionally, we utilize a large Vision-Language Model to provide detailed descriptions of the removed objects and a Large Language Model to convert these descriptions into diverse, natural-language instructions. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that the trained model surpasses existing models in both object addition and general editing tasks.

In the field of flow models, knowledge distillation of multi - teacher diffusion models is also a problem worthy of discussion in accelerating sampling.

The level of perturbation is determined automatically through analysis of the local loss landscape. Then, we revise the edited NeRF via generative trajectories. Combined with the generative process, we impose identity-preserving gradients to refine the edited NeRF.

However, the development of 3D diffusion models has been hindered by the scarcity of high-quality 3D data, resulting in less competitive performance compared to their 2D counterparts. To address this challenge, we propose repurposing pre-trained 2D diffusion models for 3D object generation. We introduce Gaussian Atlas, a novel representation that utilizes dense 2D grids, enabling the fine-tuning of 2D diffusion models to generate 3D Gaussians. Our approach demonstrates successful transfer learning from a pre-trained 2D diffusion model to a 2D manifold flattened from 3D structures. To support model training, we compile GaussianVerse, a large-scale dataset comprising 205K high-quality 3D Gaussian fittings of various 3D objects. Our experimental results show that text-to-image diffusion models can be effectively adapted for 3D content generation, bridging the gap between 2D and 3D modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Model as a Noise-Aware Latent Reward Model for Step-Level Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01051v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference optimization for diffusion models aims to align them with human preferences for images. Previous methods typically leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as pixel-level reward models to approximate human preferences. However, when used for step-level preference optimization, these models face challenges in handling noisy images of different timesteps and require complex transformations into pixel space. In this work, we demonstrate that diffusion models are inherently well-suited for step-level reward modeling in the latent space, as they can naturally extract features from noisy latent images. Accordingly, we propose the Latent Reward Model (LRM), which repurposes components of diffusion models to predict preferences of latent images at various timesteps. Building on LRM, we introduce Latent Preference Optimization (LPO), a method designed for step-level preference optimization directly in the latent space. Experimental results indicate that LPO not only significantly enhances performance in aligning diffusion models with general, aesthetic, and text-image alignment preferences, but also achieves 2.5-28$\times$ training speedup compared to existing preference optimization methods.

In style-driven generation, users typically supply reference images exemplifying the desired style, together with text prompts that specify desired stylistic attributes. Previous approaches popularly rely on fine-tuning, yet it often blindly utilizes objectives and noise level distributions from pre-training without adaptation. We discover that stylistic features predominantly emerge at higher noise levels, leading current fine-tuning methods to exhibit suboptimal style alignment. We propose the Style-friendly SNR sampler, which aggressively shifts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distribution toward higher noise levels during fine-tuning to focus on noise levels where stylistic features emerge. This enhances models' ability to capture novel styles indicated by reference images and text prompts. We demonstrate improved generation of novel styles that cannot be adequately described solely with a text prompt, enabling the creation of new style templates for personalized content creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://stylefriendly.github.io/</p></details> |

To reduce the data requirements, a natural solution is to leverage existing data-free static avatar generation methods, such as pre-trained diffusion models with score distillation sampling (SDS), which align avatars with pseudo ground-truth outputs from the diffusion model. However, directly distilling 4D avatars from video diffusion often leads to over-smooth results due to spatial and temporal inconsistencies in the generated video. To address this issue, we propose Zero-1-to-A, a robust method that synthesizes a spatial and temporal consistency dataset for 4D avatar reconstruction using the video diffusion model. Specifically, Zero-1-to-A iteratively constructs video datasets and optimizes animatable avatars in a progressive manner, ensuring that avatar quality increases smoothly and consistently throughout the learning process. This progressive learning involves two stages: (1) Spatial Consistency Learning fixes expressions and learns from front-to-side views, and (2) Temporal Consistency Learning fixes views and learns from relaxed to exaggerated expressions, generating 4D avatars in a simple-to-complex manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Zero-1-to-A improves fidelity, animation quality, and rendering speed compared to existing diffusion-based methods, providing a solution for lifelike avatar creation.

However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

Combining with semantic communications, diffusion models are used for tasks such as denoising, data reconstruction, and content generation. However, existing diffusion-based generative models do not consider the stringent bandwidth limitation, which limits its application in wireless communication. This paper introduces a diffusion-driven semantic communication framework with advanced VAE-based compression for bandwidth-constrained generative model. Our designed architecture utilizes the diffusion model, where the signal transmission process through the wireless channel acts as the forward process in diffusion. To reduce bandwidth requirements, we incorporate a downsampling module and a paired upsampling module based on a variational auto-encoder with reparameterization at the receiver to ensure that the recovered features conform to the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we derive the loss function for our proposed system and evaluate its performance through comprehensive experiments. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in pixel-level metrics such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and semantic metrics like learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). These enhancements are more profound regarding the compression rates and SNR compared to deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC).</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Early research typically required training specialized generators for each unique task and domain, often relying on fully-labeled data. Motivated by the powerful generative capabilities and broad applications of diffusion models, we are driven to explore leveraging label-free data to empower these models for in-domain generation. Fine-tuning a pre-trained generative model on domain data is an intuitive but challenging way and often requires complex manual hyper-parameter adjustments since the limited diversity of the training data can easily disrupt the model's original generative capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose a guidance-decoupled prior preservation mechanism to achieve high generative quality and controllability by image-only data, inspired by preserving the pre-trained model from a denoising guidance perspective. We decouple domain-related guidance from the conditional guidance used in classifier-free guidance mechanisms to preserve open-world control guidance and unconditional guidance from the pre-trained model. We further propose an efficient domain knowledge learning technique to train an additional text-free UNet copy to predict domain guidance. Besides, we theoretically illustrate a multi-guidance in-domain generation pipeline for a variety of generative tasks, leveraging multiple guidances from distinct diffusion models and conditions.

However, these methods suffer from performance degradation in adverse weather conditions. The weather-robust 4D radar provides Doppler and additional geometric information, raising the possibility of addressing this challenge. To this end, we present V2X-R, the first simulated V2X dataset incorporating LiDAR, camera, and 4D radar. V2X-R contains 12,079 scenarios with 37,727 frames of LiDAR and 4D radar point clouds, 150,908 images, and 170,859 annotated 3D vehicle bounding boxes. Subsequently, we propose a novel cooperative LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline for 3D object detection and implement it with various fusion strategies. To achieve weather-robust detection, we additionally propose a Multi-modal Denoising Diffusion (MDD) module in our fusion pipeline. MDD utilizes weather-robust 4D radar feature as a condition to prompt the diffusion model to denoise noisy LiDAR features. Experiments show that our LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline demonstrates superior performance in the V2X-R dataset. Over and above this, our MDD module further improved the performance of basic fusion model by up to 5.73%/6.70% in foggy/snowy conditions with barely disrupting normal performance.

However, most existing models still struggle to maintain 3D consistency, temporal coherence, and motion accuracy. A key reason for these shortcomings is the limited representation ability of commonly used control signals(e.g., landmarks, depth maps, etc.). In addition, the lack of diversity in identity and pose variations in public datasets further hinders progress in this area. In this paper, we analyze the shortcomings of current control signals and introduce a novel control signal representation that is optimizable, dense, expressive, and 3D consistent. Our method embeds a learnable neural Gaussian onto a parametric head surface, which greatly enhances the consistency and expressiveness of diffusion-based head models.

While various supervised learning approaches have been proposed recently, these methods heavily depend on a large amount of high-quality labeled data, which are expensive to obtain in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a label-efficient framework using knowledge transfer from a pre-trained diffusion model for CT multi-organ segmentation. Specifically, we first pre-train a denoising diffusion model on 207,029 unlabeled 2D CT slices to capture anatomical patterns. Then, the model backbone is transferred to the downstream multi-organ segmentation task, followed by fine-tuning with few labeled data. In fine-tuning, two fine-tuning strategies, linear classification and fine-tuning decoder, are employed to enhance segmentation performance while preserving learned representations. Quantitative results show that the pre-trained diffusion model is capable of generating diverse and realistic 256x256 CT images (Fr\'echet inception distance (FID): 11.32, spatial Fr\'echet inception distance (sFID): 46.93, F1-score: 73.1%). Compared to state-of-the-art methods for multi-organ segmentation, our method achieves competitive performance on the FLARE 2022 dataset, particularly in limited labeled data scenarios. After fine-tuning with 1% and 10% labeled data, our method achieves dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 71.56% and 78.51%, respectively. Remarkably, the method achieves a DSC score of 51.81% using only four labeled CT slices. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in overcoming the limitations of supervised learning approaches that is highly dependent on large-scale labeled data.</p></details> |  |

While VLFMs show a rich understanding of semantic content across modalities, they often struggle with fine-grained alignment tasks that require precise correspondence between image regions and textual descriptions a limitation in medical imaging, where accurate localization and detection of clinical features are essential for diagnosis and analysis. To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage architecture where a pre-trained VLFM provides a cursory semantic understanding, while a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm refines the alignment through an iterative process that optimizes for understanding semantic context. The reward signal is designed to align the semantic information of the text with synthesized images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a medical imaging skin dataset where the generated images exhibit improved generation quality and alignment with prompt over the fine-tuned Stable Diffusion.

Predominant training datasets (e.g., InsPix2Pix) are created using text-to-image generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E) which are not trained for image editing. Accordingly, these datasets suffer from inaccurate instruction following, poor detail preserving, and generation artifacts. In this paper, we propose to address the training data quality issue with multi-perspective reward data instead of refining the ground-truth image quality. 1) we first design a quantitative metric system based on best-in-class LVLM (Large Vision Language Model), i.e., GPT-4o in our case, to evaluate the generation quality from 3 perspectives, namely, instruction following, detail preserving, and generation quality. For each perspective, we collected quantitative score in $0\sim 5$ and text descriptive feedback on the specific failure points in ground-truth edited images, resulting in a high-quality editing reward dataset, i.e., RewardEdit20K. 2) We further proposed a novel training framework to seamlessly integrate the metric output, regarded as multi-reward, into editing models to learn from the imperfect training triplets. During training, the reward scores and text descriptions are encoded as embeddings and fed into both the latent space and the U-Net of the editing models as auxiliary conditions. 3) We also build a challenging evaluation benchmark with real-world images/photos and diverse editing instructions, named Real-Edit. Experiments indicate that our multi-reward conditioned model outperforms its no-reward counterpart on two popular editing pipelines, i.e., InsPix2Pix and SmartEdit.

These limitations hinder the scalability and practicality for articulated object modeling. In this work, we propose a method to generate articulated objects from a single image. Observing the object in resting state from an arbitrary view, our method generates an articulated object that is visually consistent with the input image. To capture the ambiguity in part shape and motion posed by a single view of the object, we design a diffusion model that learns the plausible variations of objects in terms of geometry and kinematics. To tackle the complexity of generating structured data with attributes in multiple domains, we design a pipeline that produces articulated objects from high-level structure to geometric details in a coarse-to-fine manner, where we use a part connectivity graph and part abstraction as proxies. Our experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in articulated object creation by a large margin in terms of the generated object realism, resemblance to the input image, and reconstruction quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/singapo</p></details> |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Guided Refinement of 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15742v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing 3D scenes from a single image is a fundamentally ill-posed task due to the severely under-constrained nature of the problem. Consequently, when the scene is rendered from novel camera views, existing single image to 3D reconstruction methods render incoherent and blurry views. This problem is exacerbated when the unseen regions are far away from the input camera. In this work, we address these inherent limitations in existing single image-to-3D scene feedforward networks. To alleviate the poor performance due to insufficient information beyond the input image's view, we leverage a strong generative prior in the form of a pre-trained latent video diffusion model, for iterative refinement of a coarse scene represented by optimizable Gaussian parameters. To ensure that the style and texture of the generated images align with that of the input image, we incorporate on-the-fly Fourier-style transfer between the generated images and the input image. Additionally, we design a semantic uncertainty quantification module that calculates the per-pixel entropy and yields uncertainty maps used to guide the refinement process from the most confident pixels while discarding the remaining highly uncertain ones. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world scene datasets, including in-domain RealEstate-10K and out-of-domain KITTI-v2, showing that our approach can provide more realistic and high-fidelity novel view synthesis results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[All Seeds Are Not Equal: Enhancing Compositional Text-to-Image Generation with Reliable Random Seeds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18810v5)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capability in generating realistic images from arbitrary text prompts. However, they often produce inconsistent results for compositional prompts such as "two dogs" or "a penguin on the right of a bowl". Understanding these inconsistencies is crucial for reliable image generation. In this paper, we highlight the significant role of initial noise in these inconsistencies, where certain noise patterns are more reliable for compositional prompts than others. Our analyses reveal that different initial random seeds tend to guide the model to place objects in distinct image areas, potentially adhering to specific patterns of camera angles and image composition associated with the seed. To improve the model's compositional ability, we propose a method for mining these reliable cases, resulting in a curated training set of generated images without requiring any manual annotation. By fine-tuning text-to-image models on these generated images, we significantly enhance their compositional capabilities. For numerical composition, we observe relative increases of 29.3% and 19.5% for Stable Diffusion and PixArt-{\alpha}, respectively. Spatial composition sees even larger gains, with 60.7% for Stable Diffusion and 21.1% for PixArt-{\alpha}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior and Information Spreading on Twitter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15720v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the effects of coordinated users (i.e., users characterized by an unexpected, suspicious, or exceptional similarity) in information spreading on Twitter by quantifying the efficacy of their tactics in deceiving feed algorithms to maximize information outreach. In particular, we investigate the behavior of coordinated accounts within a large set of retweet-based information cascades identifying key differences between coordinated and non-coordinated accounts in terms of position within the cascade, action delay and outreach. On average, coordinated accounts occupy higher positions of the information cascade (i.e., closer to the root), spread messages faster and involve a slightly higher number of users. When considering cascade metrics such as size, number of edges and height, we observe clear differences among information cascades that are associated to a systematically larger proportion of coordinated accounts, as confirmed by comparisons with statistical null models. To further characterize the activity of coordinated accounts we introduce two new measures capturing their infectivity within the information cascade (i.e., their ability to involve other users) and their interaction with non-coordinated accounts. Finally, we find that the interaction pattern between the two classes of users follows a saturation-like process. A larger-scale targeting of non-coordinated users does not require a larger amount of coordinated accounts after a threshold value approximately 50%, after which involving more coordinated accounts within a cascade yields a null marginal effect. Our results contribute to shed light on the role of coordinated accounts and their effect on information diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Tuning Image-Conditional Diffusion Models is Easier than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11355v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work showed that large diffusion models can be reused as highly precise monocular depth estimators by casting depth estimation as an image-conditional image generation task. While the proposed model achieved state-of-the-art results, high computational demands due to multi-step inference limited its use in many scenarios. In this paper, we show that the perceived inefficiency was caused by a flaw in the inference pipeline that has so far gone unnoticed. The fixed model performs comparably to the best previously reported configuration while being more than 200$\times$ faster. To optimize for downstream task performance, we perform end-to-end fine-tuning on top of the single-step model with task-specific losses and get a deterministic model that outperforms all other diffusion-based depth and normal estimation models on common zero-shot benchmarks. We surprisingly find that this fine-tuning protocol also works directly on Stable Diffusion and achieves comparable performance to current state-of-the-art diffusion-based depth and normal estimation models, calling into question some of the conclusions drawn from prior works.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2025 Oral.

However, these models often generate videos that have misalignments with text prompts, especially when the prompts describe complex scenes with multiple objects and attributes. To address this, we introduce VideoRepair, a novel model-agnostic, training-free video refinement framework that automatically identifies fine-grained text-video misalignments and generates explicit spatial and textual feedback, enabling a T2V diffusion model to perform targeted, localized refinements. VideoRepair consists of two stages: In (1) video refinement planning, we first detect misalignments by generating fine-grained evaluation questions and answering them using an MLLM. Based on video evaluation outputs, we identify accurately generated objects and construct localized prompts to precisely refine misaligned regions. In (2) localized refinement, we enhance video alignment by 'repairing' the misaligned regions from the original video while preserving the correctly generated areas. This is achieved by frame-wise region decomposition using our Region-Preserving Segmentation (RPS) module. On two popular video generation benchmarks (EvalCrafter and T2V-CompBench), VideoRepair substantially outperforms recent baselines across various text-video alignment metrics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of VideoRepair components and qualitative examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://video-repair.github.io</p></details> |

This success has sparked interest in leveraging their representations for visual understanding tasks. While recent works have explored this potential for image generation, the visual understanding capabilities of video diffusion models remain largely uncharted. To address this gap, we systematically compare the same model architecture trained for video versus image generation, analyzing the performance of their latent representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, action recognition, depth estimation, and tracking. Results show that video diffusion models consistently outperform their image counterparts, though we find a striking range in the extent of this superiority. We further analyze features extracted from different layers and with varying noise levels, as well as the effect of model size and training budget on representation and generation quality. This work marks the first direct comparison of video and image diffusion objectives for visual understanding, offering insights into the role of temporal information in representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-focal Conditioned Latent Diffusion for Person Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15686v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) has demonstrated strong capabilities in high-resolution image generation and has been widely employed for Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS), yielding promising results. However, the compression process of LDM often results in the deterioration of details, particularly in sensitive areas such as facial features and clothing textures. In this paper, we propose a Multi-focal Conditioned Latent Diffusion (MCLD) method to address these limitations by conditioning the model on disentangled, pose-invariant features from these sensitive regions. Our approach utilizes a multi-focal condition aggregation module, which effectively integrates facial identity and texture-specific information, enhancing the model's ability to produce appearance realistic and identity-consistent images. Our method demonstrates consistent identity and appearance generation on the DeepFashion dataset and enables flexible person image editing due to its generation consistency.

In this paper, we introduce VEGGIE, a Video Editor with Grounded Generation from Instructions, a simple end-to-end framework that unifies video concept editing, grounding, and reasoning based on diverse user instructions. Specifically, given a video and text query, VEGGIE first utilizes an MLLM to interpret user intentions in instructions and ground them to the video contexts, generating frame-specific grounded task queries for pixel-space responses. A diffusion model then renders these plans and generates edited videos that align with user intent. To support diverse tasks and complex instructions, we employ a curriculum learning strategy: first aligning the MLLM and video diffusion model with large-scale instructional image editing data, followed by end-to-end fine-tuning on high-quality multitask video data. Additionally, we introduce a novel data synthesis pipeline to generate paired instructional video editing data for model training. It transforms static image data into diverse, high-quality video editing samples by leveraging Image-to-Video models to inject dynamics. VEGGIE shows strong performance in instructional video editing with different editing skills, outperforming the best instructional baseline as a versatile model, while other models struggle with multi-tasking. VEGGIE also excels in video object grounding and reasoning segmentation, where other baselines fail. We further reveal how the multiple tasks help each other and highlight promising applications like zero-shot multimodal instructional and in-context video editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First three authors contributed equally.

| **[CHROME: Clothed Human Reconstruction with Occlusion-Resilience and Multiview-Consistency from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15671v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing clothed humans from a single image is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications. Although existing monocular clothed human reconstruction solutions have shown promising results, they often rely on the assumption that the human subject is in an occlusion-free environment. Thus, when encountering in-the-wild occluded images, these algorithms produce multiview inconsistent and fragmented reconstructions. Additionally, most algorithms for monocular 3D human reconstruction leverage geometric priors such as SMPL annotations for training and inference, which are extremely challenging to acquire in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose CHROME: Clothed Human Reconstruction with Occlusion-Resilience and Multiview-ConsistEncy from a Single Image, a novel pipeline designed to reconstruct occlusion-resilient 3D humans with multiview consistency from a single occluded image, without requiring either ground-truth geometric prior annotations or 3D supervision. Specifically, CHROME leverages a multiview diffusion model to first synthesize occlusion-free human images from the occluded input, compatible with off-the-shelf pose control to explicitly enforce cross-view consistency during synthesis. A 3D reconstruction model is then trained to predict a set of 3D Gaussians conditioned on both the occluded input and synthesized views, aligning cross-view details to produce a cohesive and accurate 3D representation. CHROME achieves significant improvements in terms of both novel view synthesis (upto 3 db PSNR) and geometric reconstruction under challenging conditions.</p></details> |  |

While cutting-edge methods for full head generation are limited to modeling realistic human heads, the latest diffusion-based approaches for style-omniscient head synthesis can produce only frontal views and struggle with view consistency, preventing their conversion into true 3D models for rendering from arbitrary angles. We introduce a novel approach that generates fully consistent 360-degree head views, accommodating human, stylized, and anthropomorphic forms, including accessories like glasses and hats. Our method builds on the DiffPortrait3D framework, incorporating a custom ControlNet for back-of-head detail generation and a dual appearance module to ensure global front-back consistency. By training on continuous view sequences and integrating a back reference image, our approach achieves robust, locally continuous view synthesis. Our model can be used to produce high-quality neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for real-time, free-viewpoint rendering, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in object synthesis and 360-degree head generation for very challenging input portraits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Page:...</summary><p>Page:https://freedomgu.github.io/DiffPortrait360 Code:https://github.com/FreedomGu/DiffPortrait360/</p></details> |

Among these, privacy and security vulnerabilities are particularly concerning, posing significant ethical and legal challenges. At the heart of these vulnerabilities stands memorization, which refers to a model's tendency to store and reproduce phrases from its training data. This phenomenon has been shown to be a fundamental source to various privacy and security attacks against LLMs. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of the literature on LLM memorization, exploring it across three dimensions: granularity, retrievability, and desirability. Next, we discuss the metrics and methods used to quantify memorization, followed by an analysis of the causes and factors that contribute to memorization phenomenon. We then explore strategies that are used so far to mitigate the undesirable aspects of this phenomenon. We conclude our survey by identifying potential research topics for the near future, including methods to balance privacy and performance, and the analysis of memorization in specific LLM contexts such as conversational agents, retrieval-augmented generation, and diffusion language models. Given the rapid research pace in this field, we also maintain a dedicated repository of the references discussed in this survey which will be regularly updated to reflect the latest developments.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAM-Seg: A Continuous-valued Embedding Approach for Semantic Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15617v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional transformer-based semantic segmentation relies on quantized embeddings. However, our analysis reveals that autoencoder accuracy on segmentation mask using quantized embeddings (e.g. VQ-VAE) is 8% lower than continuous-valued embeddings (e.g. KL-VAE). Motivated by this, we propose a continuous-valued embedding framework for semantic segmentation. By reformulating semantic mask generation as a continuous image-to-embedding diffusion process, our approach eliminates the need for discrete latent representations while preserving fine-grained spatial and semantic details. Our key contribution includes a diffusion-guided autoregressive transformer that learns a continuous semantic embedding space by modeling long-range dependencies in image features. Our framework contains a unified architecture combining a VAE encoder for continuous feature extraction, a diffusion-guided transformer for conditioned embedding generation, and a VAE decoder for semantic mask reconstruction. Our setting facilitates zero-shot domain adaptation capabilities enabled by the continuity of the embedding space. Experiments across diverse datasets (e.g., Cityscapes and domain-shifted variants) demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness to distribution shifts, including adverse weather (e.g., fog, snow) and viewpoint variations. Our model also exhibits strong noise resilience, achieving robust performance ($\approx$ 95% AP compared to baseline) under gaussian noise, moderate motion blur, and moderate brightness/contrast variations, while experiencing only a moderate impact ($\approx$ 90% AP compared to baseline) from 50% salt and pepper noise, saturation and hue shifts.

However, most of that success has built on human-specific body pose representations and extensive training with labeled real videos. In this work, we extend the ability of such models to animate images of characters with more diverse skeletal topologies. Given a small number (3-5) of example frames showing the character in different poses with corresponding skeletal information, our model quickly infers a rig for that character that can generate images corresponding to new skeleton poses. We propose a procedural data generation pipeline that efficiently samples training data with diverse topologies on the fly. We use it, along with a novel skeleton representation, to train our model on articulated shapes spanning a large space of textures and topologies. Then during fine-tuning, our model rapidly adapts to unseen target characters and generalizes well to rendering new poses, both for realistic and more stylized cartoon appearances. To better evaluate performance on this novel and challenging task, we create the first 2D video dataset that contains both humanoid and non-humanoid subjects with per-frame keypoint annotations. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior quality of our results.

However, the large computational cost and model footprint of DMs hinders practical deployment, especially on edge devices. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a lightweight method to alleviate these burdens without the need for training or fine-tuning. While recent DM PTQ methods achieve W4A8 on integer-based PTQ, two key limitations remain: First, while most existing DM PTQ methods evaluate on classical DMs like Stable Diffusion XL, 1.5 or earlier, which use convolutional U-Nets, newer Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models like the PixArt series, Hunyuan and others adopt fundamentally different transformer backbones to achieve superior image synthesis. Second, integer (INT) quantization is prevailing in DM PTQ but doesn't align well with the network weight and activation distribution, while Floating-Point Quantization (FPQ) is still under-investigated, yet it holds the potential to better align the weight and activation distributions in low-bit settings for DiT. In response, we introduce FP4DiT, a PTQ method that leverages FPQ to achieve W4A6 quantization. Specifically, we extend and generalize the Adaptive Rounding PTQ technique to adequately calibrate weight quantization for FPQ and demonstrate that DiT activations depend on input patch data, necessitating robust online activation quantization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that FP4DiT outperforms integer-based PTQ at W4A6 and W4A8 precision and generates convincing visual content on PixArt-$\alpha$, PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Hunyuan in terms of several T2I metrics such as HPSv2 and CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/cccrrrccc/FP4DiT</p></details> |

Despite their remarkable results, they typically suffer from slow inference with several steps. In this paper, we propose Di$\mathtt{[M]}$O, a novel approach that distills masked diffusion models into a one-step generator. Di$\mathtt{[M]}$O addresses two key challenges: (1) the intractability of using intermediate-step information for one-step generation, which we solve through token-level distribution matching that optimizes model output logits by an 'on-policy framework' with the help of an auxiliary model; and (2) the lack of entropy in the initial distribution, which we address through a token initialization strategy that injects randomness while maintaining similarity to teacher training distribution. We show Di$\mathtt{[M]}$O's effectiveness on both class-conditional and text-conditional image generation, impressively achieving performance competitive to multi-step teacher outputs while drastically reducing inference time. To our knowledge, we are the first to successfully achieve one-step distillation of masked diffusion models and the first to apply discrete distillation to text-to-image generation, opening new paths for efficient generative modeling.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods struggle to achieve streaming motion generation, e.g., diffusion models are constrained by pre-defined motion lengths, while GPT-based methods suffer from delayed response and error accumulation problem due to discretized non-causal tokenization. To solve these problems, we propose MotionStreamer, a novel framework that incorporates a continuous causal latent space into a probabilistic autoregressive model. The continuous latents mitigate information loss caused by discretization and effectively reduce error accumulation during long-term autoregressive generation. In addition, by establishing temporal causal dependencies between current and historical motion latents, our model fully utilizes the available information to achieve accurate online motion decoding. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches while offering more applications, including multi-round generation, long-term generation, and dynamic motion composition.

ECG sensing is non-invasive and relatively easy to acquire, and yet it is still cumbersome for holter monitoring tests that may span over hours and even days. A possible alternative in this context is Photoplethysmography (PPG): An optically-based signal that measures blood volume fluctuations, as typically sensed by conventional ``wearable devices''. While PPG presents clear advantages in acquisition, convenience, and cost-effectiveness, ECG provides more comprehensive information, allowing for a more precise detection of heart conditions. This implies that a conversion from PPG to ECG, as recently discussed in the literature, inherently involves an unavoidable level of uncertainty. In this paper we introduce a novel methodology for addressing the PPG-2-ECG conversion, and offer an enhanced classification of cardiovascular conditions using the given PPG, all while taking into account the uncertainties arising from the conversion process. We provide a mathematical justification for our proposed computational approach, and present empirical studies demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Radio map reconstruction is essential for enabling advanced applications, yet challenges such as complex signal propagation and sparse data hinder accurate reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose the **Radio Map Diffusion Model (RMDM)**, a physics-informed framework that integrates **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to incorporate constraints like the **Helmholtz equation**. RMDM employs a dual U-Net architecture: the first ensures physical consistency by minimizing PDE residuals, boundary conditions, and source constraints, while the second refines predictions via diffusion-based denoising. By leveraging physical laws, RMDM significantly enhances accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that RMDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving **NMSE of 0.0031** and **RMSE of 0.0125** under the Static RM (SRM) setting, and **NMSE of 0.0047** and **RMSE of 0.0146** under the Dynamic RM (DRM) setting.

Unlike prior methods that focus solely on preserving facial identity, our approach captures detailed full-body appearance, aligning with text descriptions for body structure and scene variations. Training this model requires large-scale paired human data, consisting of multiple images per individual with consistent full-body identities, which is notoriously difficult to obtain. To address this, we propose a data curation pipeline leveraging vision-language models to evaluate full-body appearance consistency, resulting in Visual Persona-500K, a dataset of 580k paired human images across 100k unique identities. For precise appearance transfer, we introduce a transformer encoder-decoder architecture adapted to a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, which augments the input image into distinct body regions, encodes these regions as local appearance features, and projects them into dense identity embeddings independently to condition the diffusion model for synthesizing customized images. Visual Persona consistently surpasses existing approaches, generating high-quality, customized images from in-the-wild inputs. Extensive ablation studies validate design choices, and we demonstrate the versatility of Visual Persona across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project page is available at https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/Visual-Persona</p></details> |
| **[CCDP: Composition of Conditional Diffusion Policies with Guided Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15386v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation Learning offers a promising approach to learn directly from data without requiring explicit models, simulations, or detailed task definitions. During inference, actions are sampled from the learned distribution and executed on the robot. However, sampled actions may fail for various reasons, and simply repeating the sampling step until a successful action is obtained can be inefficient. In this work, we propose an enhanced sampling strategy that refines the sampling distribution to avoid previously unsuccessful actions. We demonstrate that by solely utilizing data from successful demonstrations, our method can infer recovery actions without the need for additional exploratory behavior or a high-level controller. Furthermore, we leverage the concept of diffusion model decomposition to break down the primary problem (which may require long-horizon history to manage failures) into multiple smaller, more manageable sub-problems in learning, data collection, and inference, thereby enabling the system to adapt to variable failure counts. Our approach yields a low-level controller that dynamically adjusts its sampling space to improve efficiency when prior samples fall short. We validate our method across several tasks, including door opening with unknown directions, object manipulation, and button-searching scenarios, demonstrating that our approach outperforms traditional baselines.</p></details> |  |

| **[Diff-DAgger: Uncertainty Estimation with Diffusion Policy for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14868v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion policy has shown impressive results in handling multi-modal tasks in robotic manipulation. However, it has fundamental limitations in out-of-distribution failures that persist due to compounding errors and its limited capability to extrapolate. One way to address these limitations is robot-gated DAgger, an interactive imitation learning with a robot query system to actively seek expert help during policy rollout. While robot-gated DAgger has high potential for learning at scale, existing methods like Ensemble-DAgger struggle with highly expressive policies: They often misinterpret policy disagreements as uncertainty at multi-modal decision points. To address this problem, we introduce Diff-DAgger, an efficient robot-gated DAgger algorithm that leverages the training objective of diffusion policy. We evaluate Diff-DAgger across different robot tasks including stacking, pushing, and plugging, and show that Diff-DAgger improves the task failure prediction by 39.0%, the task completion rate by 20.6%, and reduces the wall-clock time by a factor of 7.8. We hope that this work opens up a path for efficiently incorporating expressive yet data-hungry policies into interactive robot learning settings.

| **[Guardians of Generation: Dynamic Inference-Time Copyright Shielding with Adaptive Guidance for AI Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16171v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern text-to-image generative models can inadvertently reproduce copyrighted content memorized in their training data, raising serious concerns about potential copyright infringement. We introduce Guardians of Generation, a model agnostic inference time framework for dynamic copyright shielding in AI image generation. Our approach requires no retraining or modification of the generative model weights, instead integrating seamlessly with existing diffusion pipelines. It augments the generation process with an adaptive guidance mechanism comprising three components: a detection module, a prompt rewriting module, and a guidance adjustment module. The detection module monitors user prompts and intermediate generation steps to identify features indicative of copyrighted content before they manifest in the final output. If such content is detected, the prompt rewriting mechanism dynamically transforms the user's prompt by sanitizing or replacing references that could trigger copyrighted material while preserving the prompt's intended semantics. The adaptive guidance module adaptively steers the diffusion process away from flagged content by modulating the model's sampling trajectory. Together, these components form a robust shield that enables a tunable balance between preserving creative fidelity and ensuring copyright compliance. We validate our method on a variety of generative models such as Stable Diffusion, SDXL, and Flux, demonstrating substantial reductions in copyrighted content generation with negligible impact on output fidelity or alignment with user intent. This work provides a practical, plug-and-play safeguard for generative image models, enabling more responsible deployment under real-world copyright constraints.

Active galactic nuclei identification using diffusion-based inpainting of Euclid VIS images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15321v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Light emission from galaxies exhibit diverse brightness profiles, influenced by factors such as galaxy type, structural features and interactions with other galaxies. Elliptical galaxies feature more uniform light distributions, while spiral and irregular galaxies have complex, varied light profiles due to their structural heterogeneity and star-forming activity. In addition, galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) feature intense, concentrated emission from gas accretion around supermassive black holes, superimposed on regular galactic light, while quasi-stellar objects (QSO) are the extreme case of the AGN emission dominating the galaxy. The challenge of identifying AGN and QSO has been discussed many times in the literature, often requiring multi-wavelength observations. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify AGN and QSO from a single image. Diffusion models have been recently developed in the machine-learning literature to generate realistic-looking images of everyday objects. Utilising the spatial resolving power of the Euclid VIS images, we created a diffusion model trained on one million sources, without using any source pre-selection or labels. The model learns to reconstruct light distributions of normal galaxies, since the population is dominated by them. We condition the prediction of the central light distribution by masking the central few pixels of each source and reconstruct the light according to the diffusion model. We further use this prediction to identify sources that deviate from this profile by examining the reconstruction error of the few central pixels regenerated in each source's core. Our approach, solely using VIS imaging, features high completeness compared to traditional methods of AGN and QSO selection, including optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and X-rays.

Under mild assumptions, we obtain a uniform-in-time $O(\eta^2)$ bound for the KL-divergence between the SGLD iteration and the Langevin diffusion, where $\eta$ is the step size (or learning rate). Our analysis is also valid for varying step sizes. Consequently, we are able to derive an $O(\eta)$ bound for the distance between the invariant measures of the SGLD iteration and the Langevin diffusion, in terms of Wasserstein or total variation distances. Our result can be viewed as a significant improvement compared with existing analysis for SGLD in related literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[IDArb: Intrinsic Decomposition for Arbitrary Number of Input Views and Illuminations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12083v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing geometric and material information from images remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Traditional optimization-based methods often require hours of computational time to reconstruct geometry, material properties, and environmental lighting from dense multi-view inputs, while still struggling with inherent ambiguities between lighting and material. On the other hand, learning-based approaches leverage rich material priors from existing 3D object datasets but face challenges with maintaining multi-view consistency. In this paper, we introduce IDArb, a diffusion-based model designed to perform intrinsic decomposition on an arbitrary number of images under varying illuminations. Our method achieves accurate and multi-view consistent estimation on surface normals and material properties. This is made possible through a novel cross-view, cross-domain attention module and an illumination-augmented, view-adaptive training strategy. Additionally, we introduce ARB-Objaverse, a new dataset that provides large-scale multi-view intrinsic data and renderings under diverse lighting conditions, supporting robust training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IDArb outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, our approach facilitates a range of downstream tasks, including single-image relighting, photometric stereo, and 3D reconstruction, highlighting its broad applications in realistic 3D content creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

| **[The Pitfalls of Imitation Learning when Actions are Continuous](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09722v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a discrete-time, continuous state-and-action control system. We show that, even if the dynamics are stable (i.e. contracting exponentially quickly), and the expert is smooth and deterministic, any smooth, deterministic imitator policy necessarily suffers error on execution that is exponentially larger, as a function of problem horizon, than the error under the distribution of expert training data. Our negative result applies to both behavior cloning and offline-RL algorithms, unless they produce highly "improper" imitator policies--those which are non-smooth, non-Markovian, or which exhibit highly state-dependent stochasticity--or unless the expert trajectory distribution is sufficiently "spread." We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of these more complex policy parameterizations, explicating the benefits of today's popular policy parameterizations in robot learning (e.g. action-chunking and Diffusion Policies). We also establish a host of complementary negative and positive results for imitation in control systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>98 pa...</summary><p>98 pages, 2 figures, updated introduction</p></details> |
| **[DiST-4D: Disentangled Spatiotemporal Diffusion with Metric Depth for 4D Driving Scene Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15208v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. A key challenge lies in finding an efficient and generalizable geometric representation that seamlessly connects temporal and spatial synthesis. To address this, we propose DiST-4D, the first disentangled spatiotemporal diffusion framework for 4D driving scene generation, which leverages metric depth as the core geometric representation. DiST-4D decomposes the problem into two diffusion processes: DiST-T, which predicts future metric depth and multi-view RGB sequences directly from past observations, and DiST-S, which enables spatial NVS by training only on existing viewpoints while enforcing cycle consistency. This cycle consistency mechanism introduces a forward-backward rendering constraint, reducing the generalization gap between observed and unseen viewpoints. Metric depth is essential for both accurate reliable forecasting and accurate spatial NVS, as it provides a view-consistent geometric representation that generalizes well to unseen perspectives. Experiments demonstrate that DiST-4D achieves state-of-the-art performance in both temporal prediction and NVS tasks, while also delivering competitive performance in planning-related evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detect-and-Guide: Self-regulation of Diffusion Models for Safe Text-to-Image Generation via Guideline Token Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15197v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in synthesis tasks; however, there is a growing concern about their potential misuse in creating harmful content. To mitigate these risks, post-hoc model intervention techniques, such as concept unlearning and safety guidance, have been developed. However, fine-tuning model weights or adapting the hidden states of the diffusion model operates in an uninterpretable way, making it unclear which part of the intermediate variables is responsible for unsafe generation. These interventions severely affect the sampling trajectory when erasing harmful concepts from complex, multi-concept prompts, thus hindering their practical use in real-world settings. In this work, we propose the safe generation framework Detect-and-Guide (DAG), leveraging the internal knowledge of diffusion models to perform self-diagnosis and fine-grained self-regulation during the sampling process. DAG first detects harmful concepts from noisy latents using refined cross-attention maps of optimized tokens, then applies safety guidance with adaptive strength and editing regions to negate unsafe generation. The optimization only requires a small annotated dataset and can provide precise detection maps with generalizability and concept specificity. Moreover, DAG does not require fine-tuning of diffusion models, and therefore introduces no loss to their generation diversity. Experiments on erasing sexual content show that DAG achieves state-of-the-art safe generation performance, balancing harmfulness mitigation and text-following performance on multi-concept real-world prompts.</p></details> | CVPR25 |
| **[MMO-IG: Multi-Class and Multi-Scale Object Image Generation for Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13684v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of deep generative models (DGMs) has significantly advanced research in computer vision, providing a cost-effective alternative to acquiring vast quantities of expensive imagery. However, existing methods predominantly focus on synthesizing remote sensing (RS) images aligned with real images in a global layout view, which limits their applicability in RS image object detection (RSIOD) research. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-class and multi-scale object image generator based on DGMs, termed MMO-IG, designed to generate RS images with supervised object labels from global and local aspects simultaneously. Specifically, from the local view, MMO-IG encodes various RS instances using an iso-spacing instance map (ISIM). During the generation process, it decodes each instance region with iso-spacing value in ISIM-corresponding to both background and foreground instances-to produce RS images through the denoising process of diffusion models. Considering the complex interdependencies among MMOs, we construct a spatial-cross dependency knowledge graph (SCDKG). This ensures a realistic and reliable multidirectional distribution among MMOs for region embedding, thereby reducing the discrepancy between source and target domains. Besides, we propose a structured object distribution instruction (SODI) to guide the generation of synthesized RS image content from a global aspect with SCDKG-based ISIM together. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our MMO-IG exhibits superior generation capabilities for RS images with dense MMO-supervised labels, and RS detectors pre-trained with MMO-IG show excellent performance on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-Biased General Annotated Dataset Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10831v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-training backbone networks on a general annotated dataset (e.g., ImageNet) that comprises numerous manually collected images with category annotations has proven to be indispensable for enhancing the generalization capacity of downstream visual tasks. However, those manually collected images often exhibit bias, which is non-transferable across either categories or domains, thus causing the model's generalization capacity degeneration. To mitigate this problem, we present a low-biased general annotated dataset generation framework (lbGen). Instead of expensive manual collection, we aim at directly generating low-biased images with category annotations. To achieve this goal, we propose to leverage the advantage of a multimodal foundation model (e.g., CLIP), in terms of aligning images in a low-biased semantic space defined by language. Specifically, we develop a bi-level semantic alignment loss, which not only forces all generated images to be consistent with the semantic distribution of all categories belonging to the target dataset in an adversarial learning manner, but also requires each generated image to match the semantic description of its category name. In addition, we further cast an existing image quality scoring model into a quality assurance loss to preserve the quality of the generated image. By leveraging these two loss functions, we can obtain a low-biased image generation model by simply fine-tuning a pre-trained diffusion model using only all category names in the target dataset as input. Experimental results confirm that, compared with the manually labeled dataset or other synthetic datasets, the utilization of our generated low-biased dataset leads to stable generalization capacity enhancement of different backbone networks across various tasks, especially in tasks where the manually labeled samples are scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025 Accepted Paper</p></details> |
| **[KeyFace: Expressive Audio-Driven Facial Animation for Long Sequences via KeyFrame Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01715v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current audio-driven facial animation methods achieve impressive results for short videos but suffer from error accumulation and identity drift when extended to longer durations. Existing methods attempt to mitigate this through external spatial control, increasing long-term consistency but compromising the naturalness of motion. We propose KeyFace, a novel two-stage diffusion-based framework, to address these issues. In the first stage, keyframes are generated at a low frame rate, conditioned on audio input and an identity frame, to capture essential facial expressions and movements over extended periods of time. In the second stage, an interpolation model fills in the gaps between keyframes, ensuring smooth transitions and temporal coherence. To further enhance realism, we incorporate continuous emotion representations and handle a wide range of non-speech vocalizations (NSVs), such as laughter and sighs. We also introduce two new evaluation metrics for assessing lip synchronization and NSV generation. Experimental results show that KeyFace outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating natural, coherent facial animations over extended durations, successfully encompassing NSVs and continuous emotions.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

In our approach, a diffusion-based time series forecasting model is used to probabilistically estimate the evolution of the system's stochastic components. These forecasts are then incorporated into MPC algorithms to estimate future trajectories and optimize action selection under the uncertainty of the future. We evaluate the framework on the task of energy arbitrage, where a Battery Energy Storage System participates in the day-ahead electricity market of the New York state. Experimental results indicate that our model-based approach with a diffusion-based forecaster significantly outperforms both implementations with classical forecasting methods and model-free reinforcement learning baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.
