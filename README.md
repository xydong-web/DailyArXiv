| **[Autonomous Uncertainty Quantification for Computational Point-of-care Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21335v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational point-of-care (POC) sensors enable rapid, low-cost, and accessible diagnostics in emergency, remote and resource-limited areas that lack access to centralized medical facilities. These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients. Blinded testing using new patient samples demonstrated an increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7%, indicating the effectiveness of MCDO-based uncertainty quantification in enhancing the robustness of neural network-driven computational POC sensing systems.</p></details> | 18 Pages, 5 Figures |
| **[Transcriptome-Conditioned Personalized De Novo Drug Generation for AML Using Metaheuristic Assembly and Target-Driven Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21301v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) remains a clinical challenge due to its extreme molecular heterogeneity and high relapse rates. While precision medicine has introduced mutation-specific therapies, many patients still lack effective, personalized options. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end computational framework that bridges the gap between patient-specific transcriptomics and de novo drug discovery. By analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-LAML cohort, the study utilized Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to prioritize 20 high-value biomarkers, including metabolic transporters like HK3 and immune-modulatory receptors such as SIGLEC9. The physical structures of these targets were modeled using AlphaFold3, and druggable hotspots were quantitatively mapped via the DOGSiteScorer engine. Then developed a novel, reaction-first evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm as well as multi-objective optimization programming that assembles novel ligands from fragment libraries, guided by spatial alignment to these identified hotspots. The generative model produced structurally unique chemical entities with a strong bias toward drug-like space, as evidenced by QED scores peaking between 0.5 and 0.7. Validation through ADMET profiling and SwissDock molecular docking identified high-confidence candidates, such as Ligand L1, which achieved a binding free energy of -6.571 kcal/mol against the A08A96 biomarker. These results demonstrate that integrating systems biology with metaheuristic molecular assembly can produce pharmacologically viable, patient tailored leads, offering a scalable blueprint for precision oncology in AML and beyond</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Popularity Bias in Collaborative Filtering via Analytical Vector Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10688v5)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity bias fundamentally undermines the personalization capabilities of collaborative filtering (CF) models, causing them to disproportionately recommend popular items while neglecting users' genuine preferences for niche content. While existing approaches treat this as an external confounding factor, we reveal that popularity bias is an intrinsic geometric artifact of Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) optimization in CF models. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that BPR systematically organizes item embeddings along a dominant "popularity direction" where embedding magnitudes directly correlate with interaction frequency. This geometric distortion forces user embeddings to simultaneously handle two conflicting tasks-expressing genuine preference and calibrating against global popularity-trapping them in suboptimal configurations that favor popular items regardless of individual tastes. We propose Directional Decomposition and Correction (DDC), a universally applicable framework that surgically corrects this embedding geometry through asymmetric directional updates. DDC guides positive interactions along personalized preference directions while steering negative interactions away from the global popularity direction, disentangling preference from popularity at the geometric source. Extensive experiments across multiple BPR-based architectures demonstrate that DDC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art debiasing methods, reducing training loss to less than 5% of heavily-tuned baselines while achieving superior recommendation quality and fairness.

This model is called a mixture of finite mixtures (MFM). As a prior distribution for the weights, a (symmetric) Dirichlet distribution is widely used for conjugacy and computational simplicity, while the selection of the concentration parameter influences the estimate of the number of components. In this paper, we focus on estimating the number of components. As a robust alternative Dirichlet weights, we present a method based on a mixture of finite mixtures with normalized inverse Gaussian weights. The motivation is similar to the use of normalized inverse Gaussian processes instead of Dirichlet processes for infinite mixture modeling. Introducing latent variables, the posterior computation is carried out using block Gibbs sampling without using the reversible jump algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated through some numerical experiments and real data examples, including clustering, density estimation, and community detection.</p></details> | 42 pages, 5 figures |

To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: http://haonanqiu.com/projects/HiStream.html</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Decoding Paths in Masked Diffusion Models by Quantifying Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21336v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer flexible, non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. Our work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation, effectively turning the uncertainty in MDMs from a liability into a key advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Toward Human-Centered AI-Assisted Terminology Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18859v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid diffusion of generative artificial intelligence is transforming terminology work. While this technology promises gains in efficiency, its unstructured adoption risks weakening professional autonomy, amplifying bias, and eroding linguistic and conceptual diversity. This paper argues that a human-centered approach to artificial intelligence has become a necessity for terminology work. Building on research in artificial intelligence and translation studies, it proposes a human-centered framework that conceptualizes artificial intelligence as a means of amplifying the terminologist's capabilities, rather than replacing them. The framework is organized around three interrelated dimensions: the augmented terminologist, ethical AI, and human-centered design. Together, these dimensions emphasize the compatibility of high automation with strong human control, the central role of terminologists in bias mitigation, and the importance of designing AI tools and workflows around the needs, values, and well-being of the terminologist. The paper concludes by stressing that current choices in AI adoption will shape not only terminological practice, but also the preservation of accuracy, adequacy, and diversity in terminology and specialized knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variationally correct operator learning: Reduced basis neural operator with a posteriori error estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21319v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Minimizing PDE-residual losses is a common strategy to promote physical consistency in neural operators. However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by constructing first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives whose values are provably equivalent to the solution error in PDE-induced norms. We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization. Numerical benchmarks validate these theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard baselines, while the residual loss serves as a reliable, computable a posteriori error estimator.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a two-stage pipeline: a compact seed set of human-sung recordings is constructed by pairing fixed melodies with diverse LLM-generated lyrics, and melody-specific models are trained to synthesize over 500 hours of high-quality Chinese singing data. Building on this corpus, we propose DiTSinger, a Diffusion Transformer with RoPE and qk-norm, systematically scaled in depth, width, and resolution for enhanced fidelity. Furthermore, we design an implicit alignment mechanism that obviates phoneme-level duration labels by constraining phoneme-to-acoustic attention within character-level spans, thereby improving robustness under noisy or uncertain alignments. Extensive experiments validate that our approach enables scalable, alignment-free, and high-fidelity SVS.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP26 under review.

While existing approaches treat this as an external confounding factor, we reveal that popularity bias is an intrinsic geometric artifact of Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) optimization in CF models.

However, is this straightforward representation ideal given the current state-of-the-art (SoTA)? In this work, we address this question in the context of generative models and aim to devise a more effective way of modeling image sequence data. Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames. Yet, we learn to generate image sequences, using the strong self-attention mechanism of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to capture correlations between frames. In effect, our formulation extends a 2D image generator to operate as a low-resolution 3D image-sequence generator without introducing any architectural modifications. Subsequently, we super-resolve each frame individually to add the sequence-independent high-resolution details. This approach offers several advantages and can overcome key limitations of the SoTA in this domain. Compared to existing image sequence generation models, our method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences. It also delivers high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences and increased efficiency in inference time and training data usage. Furthermore, our straightforward formulation enables our method to generalize effectively across diverse data domains, which typically require additional priors and supervision to model in a generative context. Our method consistently outperforms SoTA in quality and inference speed (at least twice-as-fast) across datasets.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research.

| **[ACD: Direct Conditional Control for Video Diffusion Models via Attention Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21268v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllability is a fundamental requirement in video synthesis, where accurate alignment with conditioning signals is essential. Existing classifier-free guidance methods typically achieve conditioning indirectly by modeling the joint distribution of data and conditions, which often results in limited controllability over the specified conditions. Classifier-based guidance enforces conditions through an external classifier, but the model may exploit this mechanism to raise the classifier score without genuinely satisfying the intended condition, resulting in adversarial artifacts and limited effective controllability. In this paper, we propose Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD), a novel framework for direct conditional control in video diffusion models via attention supervision. By aligning the model's attention maps with external control signals, ACD achieves better controllability. To support this, we introduce a sparse 3D-aware object layout as an efficient conditioning signal, along with a dedicated Layout ControlNet and an automated annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration. Extensive experiments on benchmark video generation datasets demonstrate that ACD delivers superior alignment with conditioning inputs while preserving temporal coherence and visual fidelity, establishing an effective paradigm for conditional video synthesis.</p></details> |  |

These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients. Blinded testing using new patient samples demonstrated an increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7%, indicating the effectiveness of MCDO-based uncertainty quantification in enhancing the robustness of neural network-driven computational POC sensing systems.</p></details> | 18 Pages, 5 Figures |

While existing approaches treat this as an external confounding factor, we reveal that popularity bias is an intrinsic geometric artifact of Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) optimization in CF models. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that BPR systematically organizes item embeddings along a dominant "popularity direction" where embedding magnitudes directly correlate with interaction frequency. This geometric distortion forces user embeddings to simultaneously handle two conflicting tasks-expressing genuine preference and calibrating against global popularity-trapping them in suboptimal configurations that favor popular items regardless of individual tastes. We propose Directional Decomposition and Correction (DDC), a universally applicable framework that surgically corrects this embedding geometry through asymmetric directional updates. DDC guides positive interactions along personalized preference directions while steering negative interactions away from the global popularity direction, disentangling preference from popularity at the geometric source. Extensive experiments across multiple BPR-based architectures demonstrate that DDC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art debiasing methods, reducing training loss to less than 5% of heavily-tuned baselines while achieving superior recommendation quality and fairness.

In this paper, we introduce Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), an algorithmic framework that describes the dynamics of feature learning in two-layer networks trained from small initialization. Prior works have shown that gradient flow in this regime exhibits a staircase-like loss curve, alternating between plateaus where neurons slowly align to useful directions and sharp drops where neurons rapidly grow in norm. AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step process: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a cost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each iteration, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and a drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these drops, matching experiments across several commonly studied architectures. We show that AGF unifies and extends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks and attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular modes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we prove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization. Applying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give the first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that networks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude. Altogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning in neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 8 figures, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The basic GLM model is a logistic mixed model combined with random effects for persons and items. Additional models address error correlation in eye-tracking serial observations. In particular, three novel approaches are illustrated that address serial without the use of an observed lag-1 predictor: a first-order autoregressive model and a first-order moving average models obtained with generalized estimating equations, and a recurrent two-state survival model used with run-length encoded data. Altogether, the results of five different analyses point to unresolved issues in the analysis of eye-tracking data and new directions for analytic development. A more traditional model incorporating a lag-1 observed outcome for serial correlation is also included.</p></details> |  |
