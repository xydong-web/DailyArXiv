In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time, maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5° on the CO3Dv2 dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5° on RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry, achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of correspondence methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we present Video Mask-to-Matte Model (VideoMaMa) that converts coarse segmentation masks into pixel accurate alpha mattes, by leveraging pretrained video diffusion models. VideoMaMa demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to real-world footage, even though it is trained solely on synthetic data. Building on this capability, we develop a scalable pseudo-labeling pipeline for large-scale video matting and construct the Matting Anything in Video (MA-V) dataset, which offers high-quality matting annotations for more than 50K real-world videos spanning diverse scenes and motions. To validate the effectiveness of this dataset, we fine-tune the SAM2 model on MA-V to obtain SAM2-Matte, which outperforms the same model trained on existing matting datasets in terms of robustness on in-the-wild videos. These findings emphasize the importance of large-scale pseudo-labeled video matting and showcase how generative priors and accessible segmentation cues can drive scalable progress in video matting research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/VideoMaMa/</p></details> |

| **[Q-learning with Adjoint Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14234v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Q-learning with Adjoint Matching (QAM), a novel TD-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that tackles a long-standing challenge in continuous-action RL: efficient optimization of an expressive diffusion or flow-matching policy with respect to a parameterized Q-function. Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we propose an interpretable decision support framework. Our system integrates four core components: (1) a clustering-based stratification module that categorizes patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups upon ICU admission, using clustering with statistical validation; (2) a synthetic data augmentation pipeline leveraging variational autoencoders (VAE) and diffusion models to enrich underrepresented trajectories such as fluid or vasopressor administration; (3) an offline reinforcement learning (RL) agent trained using Advantage Weighted Regression (AWR) with a lightweight attention encoder and supported by an ensemble models for conservative, safety-aware treatment recommendations; and (4) a rationale generation module powered by a multi-modal large language model (LLM), which produces natural-language justifications grounded in clinical context and retrieved expert knowledge. Evaluated on the MIMIC-III and eICU datasets, our approach achieves high treatment accuracy while providing clinicians with interpretable and robust policy recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, Conference: IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications 2025 (ICMLA 2025): https://www.icmla-conference.org/icmla25/</p></details> |
| **[Copy-Trasform-Paste: Zero-Shot Object-Object Alignment Guided by Vision-Language and Geometric Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14207v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study zero-shot 3D alignment of two given meshes, using a text prompt describing their spatial relation -- an essential capability for content creation and scene assembly. Earlier approaches primarily rely on geometric alignment procedures, while recent work leverages pretrained 2D diffusion models to model language-conditioned object-object spatial relationships. In contrast, we directly optimize the relative pose at test time, updating translation, rotation, and isotropic scale with CLIP-driven gradients via a differentiable renderer, without training a new model. Our framework augments language supervision with geometry-aware objectives: a variant of soft-Iterative Closest Point (ICP) term to encourage surface attachment and a penetration loss to discourage interpenetration. A phased schedule strengthens contact constraints over time, and camera control concentrates the optimization on the interaction region. To enable evaluation, we curate a benchmark containing diverse categories and relations, and compare against baselines. Our method outperforms all alternatives, yielding semantically faithful and physically plausible alignments.</p></details> |  |

| **[DiffusionAgent: Navigating Expert Models for Agentic Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10061v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the accelerating era of human-instructed visual content creation, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative potential. Yet their deployment is constrained by a dual bottleneck: semantic ambiguity in diverse prompts and the narrow specialization of individual models. A single diffusion architecture struggles to maintain optimal performance across heterogeneous prompts, while conventional "parse-then-call" pipelines artificially separate semantic understanding from generative execution. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiffusionAgent, a unified, language-model-driven agent that casts the entire "prompt comprehension-expert routing-image synthesis" loop into a agentic framework. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) a tree-of-thought-powered expert navigator that performs fine-grained semantic parsing and zero-shot matching to the most suitable diffusion model via an extensible prior-knowledge tree; (2) an advantage database updated with human-in-the-loop feedback, continually aligning model-selection policy with human aesthetic and semantic preferences; and (3) a fully decoupled agent architecture that activates the optimal generative path for open-domain prompts without retraining or fine-tuning any expert. Extensive experiments show that DiffusionAgent retains high generation quality while significantly broadening prompt coverage, establishing a new performance and generality benchmark for multi-domain image synthesis. The code is available at https://github.com/DiffusionAgent/DiffusionAgent</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC.

On challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5° on the CO3Dv2 dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5° on RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500.

| **[DiffRatio: Training One-Step Diffusion Models Without Teacher Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08005v4)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based distillation methods (e.g., variational score distillation) train one-step diffusion models by first pre-training a teacher score model and then distilling it into a one-step student model. However, the gradient estimator in the distillation stage usually suffers from two sources of bias: (1) biased teacher supervision due to score estimation error incurred during pre-training, and (2) the student model's score estimation error during distillation. These biases can degrade the quality of the resulting one-step diffusion model. To address this, we propose DiffRatio, a new framework for training one-step diffusion models: instead of estimating the teacher and student scores independently and then taking their difference, we directly estimate the score difference as the gradient of a learned log density ratio between the student and data distributions across diffusion time steps. This approach greatly simplifies the training pipeline, significantly reduces gradient estimation bias, and improves one-step generation quality. Additionally, it also reduces auxiliary network size by using a lightweight density-ratio network instead of two full score networks, which improves computational and memory efficiency. DiffRatio achieves competitive one-step generation results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet (64x64 and 512x512), outperforming most teacher-supervised distillation approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, 2 algorithms</p></details> |

Earlier approaches primarily rely on geometric alignment procedures, while recent work leverages pretrained 2D diffusion models to model language-conditioned object-object spatial relationships. In contrast, we directly optimize the relative pose at test time, updating translation, rotation, and isotropic scale with CLIP-driven gradients via a differentiable renderer, without training a new model. Our framework augments language supervision with geometry-aware objectives: a variant of soft-Iterative Closest Point (ICP) term to encourage surface attachment and a penetration loss to discourage interpenetration. A phased schedule strengthens contact constraints over time, and camera control concentrates the optimization on the interaction region. To enable evaluation, we curate a benchmark containing diverse categories and relations, and compare against baselines. Our method outperforms all alternatives, yielding semantically faithful and physically plausible alignments.</p></details> |  |

We show that for any mixed state $ρ$ with finite entropy and any $E>0$ there exists a solution $H(ρ,E_0,E)$ of the above problem (unique in the non-degenerate case) which we call optimal Hamiltonian for the state $ρ$. Explicit expressions for $H(ρ,E_0,E)$, $γ_{H(ρ,E_0,E)}(E)$ and $S(γ_{H(ρ,E_0,E)}(E))$ are obtained. Analytical properties of the function $E\mapsto S(γ_{H(ρ,E_0,E)}(E))$ are explored. Several examples are considered. We also consider a modification of the above task in which arbitrary Hamiltonians (not necessarily grounded) are considered. The basic application motivated this research is described. As examples, new semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy and for the entanglement of formation are obtained and briefly discussed (with the intention to give a detailed analysis in a separate article).</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, v2 - esssentailly modified version, in v3 new optimal semicontinuity bound for the von Neumann entropy is added, any comments are still welcome</p></details> |
