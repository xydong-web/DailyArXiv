| **[Retrieval-Augmented Foundation Models for Matched Molecular Pair Transformations to Recapitulate Medicinal Chemistry Intuition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16684v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matched molecular pairs (MMPs) capture the local chemical edits that medicinal chemists routinely use to design analogs, but existing ML approaches either operate at the whole-molecule level with limited edit controllability or learn MMP-style edits from restricted settings and small models. We propose a variable-to-variable formulation of analog generation and train a foundation model on large-scale MMP transformations (MMPTs) to generate diverse variables conditioned on an input variable. To enable practical control, we develop prompting mechanisms that let the users specify preferred transformation patterns during generation. We further introduce MMPT-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that uses external reference analogs as contextual guidance to steer generation and generalize from project-specific series. Experiments on general chemical corpora and patent-specific datasets demonstrate improved diversity, novelty, and controllability, and show that our method recovers realistic analog structures in practical discovery scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The complex physics of the deformable object makes this problem of cloth manipulation nontrivial. In order to create a general manipulation strategy that addresses a variety of shapes, sizes, fold and wrinkle patterns, in addition to the usual problems of appearance variations, it becomes important to carefully consider model structure and their implications for generalisation performance. In this paper, we present an approach to in-air cloth manipulation that uses a variation of a recently proposed reinforcement learning architecture, DreamerV2. Our implementation modifies this architecture to utilise surface normals input, in addition to modiying the replay buffer and data augmentation procedures. Taken together these modifications represent an enhancement to the world model used by the robot, addressing the physical complexity of the object being manipulated by the robot. We present evaluations both in simulation and in a zero-shot deployment of the trained policies in a physical robot setup, performing in-air unfolding of a variety of different cloth types, demonstrating the generalisation benefits of our proposed architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Protocol as Poetry: A Case Study of Pak's Smart Contract-Based Protocol Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12393v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protocol art has recently proliferated through blockchain-based smart contracts, building on a century-long lineage of conceptual, participatory, interactive, systematic, algorithmic, and generative art practices. Few studies have examined the characteristics and appreciation of this emerging art form. To address this gap, this paper presents an annotated portfolio analysis of protocol artworks by Pak, a pioneering and influential pseudonymous artist who treats smart contracts as medium and collective participation through protocol as message. Tracing the evolution from early open-edition releases of The Fungible (2021) and the dynamic mechanics of Merge (2021) to the soul-bound messaging of Censored (2022) and the reflective absence of Not Found (2023), we examine how Pak choreographs distributed agency across collectors and autonomous code, demonstrating how programmable protocols become a social fabric in artistic meaning-making. Through thematic analysis of Pak's works, we identify seven core characteristics distinguishing protocol art from other art forms: (1) system-centric rather than object-centric composition, (2) autonomous governance enabling open-ended control, (3) distributed agency and communal authorship, (4) temporal dynamism and lifecycle aesthetics, (5) economy-driven engagement, (6) poetic message embedded in interaction rituals, and (7) interoperability enabling composability for emergent complexity. We then discuss how these features set protocol art apart from adjacent movements such as conceptual, generative, participatory, interactive, and performance art. By analyzing principles grounded in Pak's practice, we contribute to the emerging literature on protocol art (or "protocolism") and offer design implications for future artists exploring this evolving form.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ARTECH 2025</p></details> |
| **[Elements of Robot Morphology: Supporting Designers in Robot Form Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09203v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot morphology, the form, shape, and structure of robots, is a key design space in human-robot interaction (HRI), shaping how robots function, express themselves, and interact with people. Yet, despite its importance, little is known about how design frameworks can guide systematic form exploration. To address this gap, we introduce Elements of Robot Morphology, a framework that identifies five fundamental elements: perception, articulation, end effectors, locomotion, and structure. Derived from an analysis of existing robots, the framework supports structured exploration of diverse robot forms. To operationalize the framework, we developed Morphology Exploration Blocks (MEB), a set of tangible blocks that enable hands-on, collaborative experimentation with robot morphologies. We evaluate the framework and toolkit through a case study and design workshops, showing how they support analysis, ideation, reflection, and collaborative robot design.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, Proceedings of the 21st ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI '26)</p></details> |
| **[Quecto-V1: Empirical Analysis of 8-bit Quantized Small Language Models for On-Device Legal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16640v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but has simultaneously created a "resource divide." State-of-the-art legal intelligence systems typically rely on massive parameter counts (7B+) and cloud-based inference, rendering them inaccessible to practitioners in resource-constrained environments and posing significant data sovereignty risks. This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) engineered to democratize access to Indian legal intelligence. Built upon a custom configuration of the GPT-2 architecture (124 million parameters), Quecto-V1 was trained from scratch exclusively on a corpus of Indian statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Constitution of India. Unlike generalist models, which prioritize broad world knowledge, our approach maximizes "lexical density" within the legal domain. Furthermore, we address the deployment bottleneck by applying post-training 8-bit quantization (GGUF format), compressing the model to a memory footprint of under 150 MB. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Quecto-V1 achieves high fidelity in retrieving statutory definitions and penal provisions, outperforming general-purpose SLMs in domain-specific exact match tasks while running entirely offline on consumer-grade CPUs. We further present an ablation study showing that 8-bit quantization yields a 74% reduction in model size with less than 3.5% degradation in retrieval accuracy compared to full-precision baselines. These findings suggest that for specialized, high-stakes domains like law, domain-specific training coupled with aggressive quantization offers a viable, privacy-preserving alternative to monolithic cloud models.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 tables |

We introduce the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG), a benchmark that operationalizes persuasion and resistance as a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation over financial resources. Using a round-robin tournament across frontier models, AREG enables joint evaluation of offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities within a single interactional framework. Our analysis provides evidence that these capabilities are weakly correlated ($ρ= 0.33$) and empirically dissociated: strong persuasive performance does not reliably predict strong resistance, and vice versa. Across all evaluated models, resistance scores exceed persuasion scores, indicating a systematic defensive advantage in adversarial dialogue settings. Further linguistic analysis suggests that interaction structure plays a central role in these outcomes. Incremental commitment-seeking strategies are associated with higher extraction success, while verification-seeking responses are more prevalent in successful defenses than explicit refusal. Together, these findings indicate that social influence in LLMs is not a monolithic capability and that evaluation frameworks focusing on persuasion alone may overlook asymmetric behavioral vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 11 tables.

| **[Enhanced Diffusion Sampling: Efficient Rare Event Sampling and Free Energy Calculation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16634v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rare-event sampling problem has long been the central limiting factor in molecular dynamics (MD), especially in biomolecular simulation. Recently, diffusion models such as BioEmu have emerged as powerful equilibrium samplers that generate independent samples from complex molecular distributions, eliminating the cost of sampling rare transition events. However, a sampling problem remains when computing observables that rely on states which are rare in equilibrium, for example folding free energies. Here, we introduce enhanced diffusion sampling, enabling efficient exploration of rare-event regions while preserving unbiased thermodynamic estimators. The key idea is to perform quantitatively accurate steering protocols to generate biased ensembles and subsequently recover equilibrium statistics via exact reweighting. We instantiate our framework in three algorithms: UmbrellaDiff (umbrella sampling with diffusion models), $Δ$G-Diff (free-energy differences via tilted ensembles), and MetaDiff (a batchwise analogue for metadynamics). Across toy systems, protein folding landscapes and folding free energies, our methods achieve fast, accurate, and scalable estimation of equilibrium properties within GPU-minutes to hours per system -- closing the rare-event sampling gap that remained after the advent of diffusion-model equilibrium samplers.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study the pre-training of multi-vector models and show that large-scale multi-vector pre-training yields much stronger multi-vector models. Notably, a fully ColBERT-pre-trained model, ColBERT-Zero, trained only on public data, outperforms GTE-ModernColBERT as well as its base model, GTE-ModernBERT, which leverages closed and much stronger data, setting new state-of-the-art for model this size. We also find that, although performing only a small KD step is not enough to achieve results close to full pre-training, adding a supervised step beforehand allows to achieve much closer performance while skipping the most costly unsupervised phase. Finally, we find that aligning the fine-tuning and pre-training setups is crucial when repurposing existing models. To enable exploration of our results, we release various checkpoints as well as code used to train them.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |

This study characterized trajectories of wearable-measured physical activity during the year preceding incident MDD diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective nested case-control study using linked electronic health record and Fitbit data from the All of Us Research Program. Adults with at least 6 months of valid wearable data in the year before diagnosis were eligible. Incident MDD cases were matched to controls on age, sex, body mass index, and index time (up to four controls per case). Daily step counts and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were aggregated into monthly averages. Linear mixed-effects models compared trajectories from 12 months before diagnosis to diagnosis. Within cases, contrasts identified when activity first significantly deviated from levels 12 months prior. The cohort included 4,104 participants (829 cases and 3,275 controls; 81.7% women; median age 48.4 years). Compared with controls, cases showed consistently lower activity and significant downward trajectories in both step counts and MVPA during the year before diagnosis (P < 0.001). Significant declines appeared about 4 months before diagnosis for step counts and 5 months for MVPA. Exploratory analyses suggested subgroup differences, including steeper declines in men, greater intensity reductions at older ages, and persistently low activity among individuals with obesity. Sustained within-person declines in physical activity emerged months before incident MDD diagnosis. Longitudinal wearable monitoring may provide early signals to support risk stratification and earlier intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Whittle-Matérn Fields with Variable Smoothness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16581v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce and analyze a nonlocal generalization of Whittle--Matérn Gaussian fields in which the smoothness parameter varies in space through the fractional order, $s=s(x)\in[\underline{s}\,,\bar{s}]\subset(0,1)$. The model is defined via an integral-form operator whose kernel is constructed from the modified Bessel function of the second kind and whose local singularity is governed by the symmetric exponent $β(x,y)=(s(x)+s(y))/2$. This variable-order nonlocal formulation departs from the classical constant-order pseudodifferential setting and raises new analytic and numerical challenges. We develop a novel variational framework adapted to the kernel, prove existence and uniqueness of weak solutions on truncated bounded domains, and derive Sobolev regularity of the Gaussian (spectral) solution controlled by the minimal local order: realizations lie in $H^r(G)$ for every $r<2\underline{s}-\tfrac{d}{2}$ (here $H^r(G)$ denotes the Sobolev space on the bounded domain $G$), hence in $L_2(G)$ when $\underline s>d/4$. We also present a finite-element sampling method for the integral model, derive error estimates, and provide numerical experiments in one dimension that illustrate the impact of spatially varying smoothness on samples covariances. Computational aspects and directions for scalable implementations are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

| **[Predicting The Cop Number Using Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16600v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cops and Robbers is a pursuit evasion game played on a graph, first introduced independently by Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux} and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{NOWAKOWSKI1983235} over four decades ago. A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.</p></details> | 8 pages |

This study characterized trajectories of wearable-measured physical activity during the year preceding incident MDD diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective nested case-control study using linked electronic health record and Fitbit data from the All of Us Research Program. Adults with at least 6 months of valid wearable data in the year before diagnosis were eligible. Incident MDD cases were matched to controls on age, sex, body mass index, and index time (up to four controls per case). Daily step counts and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were aggregated into monthly averages. Linear mixed-effects models compared trajectories from 12 months before diagnosis to diagnosis. Within cases, contrasts identified when activity first significantly deviated from levels 12 months prior. The cohort included 4,104 participants (829 cases and 3,275 controls; 81.7% women; median age 48.4 years). Compared with controls, cases showed consistently lower activity and significant downward trajectories in both step counts and MVPA during the year before diagnosis (P < 0.001). Significant declines appeared about 4 months before diagnosis for step counts and 5 months for MVPA. Exploratory analyses suggested subgroup differences, including steeper declines in men, greater intensity reductions at older ages, and persistently low activity among individuals with obesity. Sustained within-person declines in physical activity emerged months before incident MDD diagnosis. Longitudinal wearable monitoring may provide early signals to support risk stratification and earlier intervention.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches predominantly treat CSI compression as a source-coding problem, thereby neglecting transmission errors. Conventional separate source and channel coding suffers from the cliff effect, leading to significant deterioration in reconstruction performance under challenging channel conditions. While existing autoencoder-based compression schemes can be readily extended to support joint source-channel coding, they struggle to capture complex channel distributions and exhibit poor scalability with increasing parameter count. To overcome these inherent limitations of autoencoder-based approaches, we propose Residual-Diffusion Joint Source-Channel Coding (RD- JSCC), a novel framework that integrates a lightweight autoencoder with a residual diffusion module to iteratively refine CSI reconstruction. Our flexible decoding strategy balances computational efficiency and performance by dynamically switching between low-complexity autoencoder decoding and sophisticated diffusion-based refinement based on channel conditions. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that RD-JSCC significantly outperforms existing autoencoder-based approaches in challenging wireless environments. Furthermore, RD-JSCC offers several practical features, including a low-latency 2-step diffusion during inference, support for multiple compression rates with a single model, robustness to fixed-bit quantization, and adaptability to imperfect channel estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures, To appear in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 2026</p></details> |

Adversarial approaches require target-domain adversarial loss during training, which can limit generalization to unseen data, while diffusion-inversion methods often produce low-fidelity translations due to imperfect inversion into noise-latent representations. In this work, we propose the Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB), a versatile framework that integrates external semantic priors into diffusion bridge models to enable spatially faithful translation without cross-domain supervision. Our key idea is to leverage self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations that are invariant to appearance changes but capture geometric structure, forming a shared latent space that conditions the diffusion bridges. Extensive experiments show that SSB outperforms strong prior methods for challenging medical image synthesis in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, and extends easily to high-quality text-guided editing.</p></details> | 36 pages |

Few studies have examined the characteristics and appreciation of this emerging art form. To address this gap, this paper presents an annotated portfolio analysis of protocol artworks by Pak, a pioneering and influential pseudonymous artist who treats smart contracts as medium and collective participation through protocol as message. Tracing the evolution from early open-edition releases of The Fungible (2021) and the dynamic mechanics of Merge (2021) to the soul-bound messaging of Censored (2022) and the reflective absence of Not Found (2023), we examine how Pak choreographs distributed agency across collectors and autonomous code, demonstrating how programmable protocols become a social fabric in artistic meaning-making.

| **[Closing the Distribution Gap in Adversarial Training for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15238v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial training for LLMs is one of the most promising methods to reliably improve robustness against adversaries. However, despite significant progress, models remain vulnerable to simple in-distribution exploits, such as rewriting prompts in the past tense or translating them into other languages. We argue that this persistent fragility stems from a fundamental limitation in current adversarial training algorithms: they minimize adversarial loss on their training set but inadequately cover the data distribution, resulting in vulnerability to seemingly simple attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose Distributional Adversarial Training, DAT. We leverage Diffusion LLMs to approximate the true joint distribution of prompts and responses, enabling generation of diverse, high-likelihood samples that address generalization failures. By combining optimization over the data distribution provided by the diffusion model with continuous adversarial training, DAT achieves substantially higher adversarial robustness than previous methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Nonlinear Quenching Effects on Polar Field Buildup in the Sun Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16656v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The solar dynamo relies on the regeneration of the poloidal magnetic field through processes strongly modulated by nonlinear feedbacks such as tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). These mechanisms play a decisive role in regulating the buildup of the Sun's polar field and, in turn, the amplitude of future solar cycles. In this work, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to solve the surface flux transport (SFT) equation, embedding physical constraints directly into the neural network framework. By systematically varying transport parameters, we isolate the relative contributions of TQ and LQ to polar dipole buildup. We use the residual dipole moment as a diagnostic for cycle-to-cycle amplification and show that TQ suppression strengthens with increasing diffusivity, while LQ dominates in advection-dominated regimes. The ratio $ΔD_{\mathrm{LQ}}/ΔD_{\mathrm{TQ}}$ exhibits a smooth inverse-square dependence on the dynamo effectivity range, refining previous empirical fits with improved accuracy and reduced scatter. The results further reveal that the need for a decay term is not essential for PINN set-up due to the training process. Compared with the traditional 1D SFT model, the PINN framework achieves significantly lower error metrics and more robust recovery of nonlinear trends. Our results suggest that the nonlinear interplay between LQ and TQ can naturally produce alternations between weak and strong cycles, providing a physical explanation for the observed even-odd cycle modulation. These findings demonstrate the potential of PINN as an accurate, efficient, and physically consistent tool for solar cycle prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal</p></details> |

State-of-the-art legal intelligence systems typically rely on massive parameter counts (7B+) and cloud-based inference, rendering them inaccessible to practitioners in resource-constrained environments and posing significant data sovereignty risks. This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) engineered to democratize access to Indian legal intelligence. Built upon a custom configuration of the GPT-2 architecture (124 million parameters), Quecto-V1 was trained from scratch exclusively on a corpus of Indian statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Constitution of India. Unlike generalist models, which prioritize broad world knowledge, our approach maximizes "lexical density" within the legal domain. Furthermore, we address the deployment bottleneck by applying post-training 8-bit quantization (GGUF format), compressing the model to a memory footprint of under 150 MB. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Quecto-V1 achieves high fidelity in retrieving statutory definitions and penal provisions, outperforming general-purpose SLMs in domain-specific exact match tasks while running entirely offline on consumer-grade CPUs. We further present an ablation study showing that 8-bit quantization yields a 74% reduction in model size with less than 3.5% degradation in retrieval accuracy compared to full-precision baselines. These findings suggest that for specialized, high-stakes domains like law, domain-specific training coupled with aggressive quantization offers a viable, privacy-preserving alternative to monolithic cloud models.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 tables |

We introduce the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG), a benchmark that operationalizes persuasion and resistance as a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation over financial resources. Using a round-robin tournament across frontier models, AREG enables joint evaluation of offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities within a single interactional framework. Our analysis provides evidence that these capabilities are weakly correlated ($ρ= 0.33$) and empirically dissociated: strong persuasive performance does not reliably predict strong resistance, and vice versa. Across all evaluated models, resistance scores exceed persuasion scores, indicating a systematic defensive advantage in adversarial dialogue settings. Further linguistic analysis suggests that interaction structure plays a central role in these outcomes. Incremental commitment-seeking strategies are associated with higher extraction success, while verification-seeking responses are more prevalent in successful defenses than explicit refusal. Together, these findings indicate that social influence in LLMs is not a monolithic capability and that evaluation frameworks focusing on persuasion alone may overlook asymmetric behavioral vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 11 tables.

In this paper, we study the pre-training of multi-vector models and show that large-scale multi-vector pre-training yields much stronger multi-vector models. Notably, a fully ColBERT-pre-trained model, ColBERT-Zero, trained only on public data, outperforms GTE-ModernColBERT as well as its base model, GTE-ModernBERT, which leverages closed and much stronger data, setting new state-of-the-art for model this size. We also find that, although performing only a small KD step is not enough to achieve results close to full pre-training, adding a supervised step beforehand allows to achieve much closer performance while skipping the most costly unsupervised phase.

The model is defined via an integral-form operator whose kernel is constructed from the modified Bessel function of the second kind and whose local singularity is governed by the symmetric exponent $β(x,y)=(s(x)+s(y))/2$. This variable-order nonlocal formulation departs from the classical constant-order pseudodifferential setting and raises new analytic and numerical challenges. We develop a novel variational framework adapted to the kernel, prove existence and uniqueness of weak solutions on truncated bounded domains, and derive Sobolev regularity of the Gaussian (spectral) solution controlled by the minimal local order: realizations lie in $H^r(G)$ for every $r<2\underline{s}-\tfrac{d}{2}$ (here $H^r(G)$ denotes the Sobolev space on the bounded domain $G$), hence in $L_2(G)$ when $\underline s>d/4$.

State-of-the-art legal intelligence systems typically rely on massive parameter counts (7B+) and cloud-based inference, rendering them inaccessible to practitioners in resource-constrained environments and posing significant data sovereignty risks. This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) engineered to democratize access to Indian legal intelligence. Built upon a custom configuration of the GPT-2 architecture (124 million parameters), Quecto-V1 was trained from scratch exclusively on a corpus of Indian statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Constitution of India. Unlike generalist models, which prioritize broad world knowledge, our approach maximizes "lexical density" within the legal domain. Furthermore, we address the deployment bottleneck by applying post-training 8-bit quantization (GGUF format), compressing the model to a memory footprint of under 150 MB. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Quecto-V1 achieves high fidelity in retrieving statutory definitions and penal provisions, outperforming general-purpose SLMs in domain-specific exact match tasks while running entirely offline on consumer-grade CPUs. We further present an ablation study showing that 8-bit quantization yields a 74% reduction in model size with less than 3.5% degradation in retrieval accuracy compared to full-precision baselines. These findings suggest that for specialized, high-stakes domains like law, domain-specific training coupled with aggressive quantization offers a viable, privacy-preserving alternative to monolithic cloud models.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 tables |

We introduce the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG), a benchmark that operationalizes persuasion and resistance as a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation over financial resources. Using a round-robin tournament across frontier models, AREG enables joint evaluation of offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities within a single interactional framework. Our analysis provides evidence that these capabilities are weakly correlated ($ρ= 0.33$) and empirically dissociated: strong persuasive performance does not reliably predict strong resistance, and vice versa. Across all evaluated models, resistance scores exceed persuasion scores, indicating a systematic defensive advantage in adversarial dialogue settings. Further linguistic analysis suggests that interaction structure plays a central role in these outcomes. Incremental commitment-seeking strategies are associated with higher extraction success, while verification-seeking responses are more prevalent in successful defenses than explicit refusal. Together, these findings indicate that social influence in LLMs is not a monolithic capability and that evaluation frameworks focusing on persuasion alone may overlook asymmetric behavioral vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 11 tables.

This study characterized trajectories of wearable-measured physical activity during the year preceding incident MDD diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective nested case-control study using linked electronic health record and Fitbit data from the All of Us Research Program. Adults with at least 6 months of valid wearable data in the year before diagnosis were eligible. Incident MDD cases were matched to controls on age, sex, body mass index, and index time (up to four controls per case). Daily step counts and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were aggregated into monthly averages. Linear mixed-effects models compared trajectories from 12 months before diagnosis to diagnosis. Within cases, contrasts identified when activity first significantly deviated from levels 12 months prior. The cohort included 4,104 participants (829 cases and 3,275 controls; 81.7% women; median age 48.4 years). Compared with controls, cases showed consistently lower activity and significant downward trajectories in both step counts and MVPA during the year before diagnosis (P < 0.001). Significant declines appeared about 4 months before diagnosis for step counts and 5 months for MVPA. Exploratory analyses suggested subgroup differences, including steeper declines in men, greater intensity reductions at older ages, and persistently low activity among individuals with obesity. Sustained within-person declines in physical activity emerged months before incident MDD diagnosis. Longitudinal wearable monitoring may provide early signals to support risk stratification and earlier intervention.</p></details> |  |

The model is defined via an integral-form operator whose kernel is constructed from the modified Bessel function of the second kind and whose local singularity is governed by the symmetric exponent $β(x,y)=(s(x)+s(y))/2$. This variable-order nonlocal formulation departs from the classical constant-order pseudodifferential setting and raises new analytic and numerical challenges. We develop a novel variational framework adapted to the kernel, prove existence and uniqueness of weak solutions on truncated bounded domains, and derive Sobolev regularity of the Gaussian (spectral) solution controlled by the minimal local order: realizations lie in $H^r(G)$ for every $r<2\underline{s}-\tfrac{d}{2}$ (here $H^r(G)$ denotes the Sobolev space on the bounded domain $G$), hence in $L_2(G)$ when $\underline s>d/4$.

This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 figures; typos fixed</p></details> |

The complex physics of the deformable object makes this problem of cloth manipulation nontrivial. In order to create a general manipulation strategy that addresses a variety of shapes, sizes, fold and wrinkle patterns, in addition to the usual problems of appearance variations, it becomes important to carefully consider model structure and their implications for generalisation performance. In this paper, we present an approach to in-air cloth manipulation that uses a variation of a recently proposed reinforcement learning architecture, DreamerV2. Our implementation modifies this architecture to utilise surface normals input, in addition to modiying the replay buffer and data augmentation procedures. Taken together these modifications represent an enhancement to the world model used by the robot, addressing the physical complexity of the object being manipulated by the robot. We present evaluations both in simulation and in a zero-shot deployment of the trained policies in a physical robot setup, performing in-air unfolding of a variety of different cloth types, demonstrating the generalisation benefits of our proposed architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Few studies have examined the characteristics and appreciation of this emerging art form. To address this gap, this paper presents an annotated portfolio analysis of protocol artworks by Pak, a pioneering and influential pseudonymous artist who treats smart contracts as medium and collective participation through protocol as message. Tracing the evolution from early open-edition releases of The Fungible (2021) and the dynamic mechanics of Merge (2021) to the soul-bound messaging of Censored (2022) and the reflective absence of Not Found (2023), we examine how Pak choreographs distributed agency across collectors and autonomous code, demonstrating how programmable protocols become a social fabric in artistic meaning-making. Through thematic analysis of Pak's works, we identify seven core characteristics distinguishing protocol art from other art forms: (1) system-centric rather than object-centric composition, (2) autonomous governance enabling open-ended control, (3) distributed agency and communal authorship, (4) temporal dynamism and lifecycle aesthetics, (5) economy-driven engagement, (6) poetic message embedded in interaction rituals, and (7) interoperability enabling composability for emergent complexity. We then discuss how these features set protocol art apart from adjacent movements such as conceptual, generative, participatory, interactive, and performance art. By analyzing principles grounded in Pak's practice, we contribute to the emerging literature on protocol art (or "protocolism") and offer design implications for future artists exploring this evolving form.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ARTECH 2025</p></details> |
| **[SoK: Data Minimization in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10836v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning (ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML). At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners, complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research communities. To address this gap, we present the first systematization of knowledge (SoK) for DMML. We introduce a general framework for DMML, encompassing a unified data pipeline, adversarial models, and points of minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review data minimization literature as well as DM-adjacent methodologies whose link to DM was often overlooked. Our structured overview is designed to help practitioners and researchers effectively adopt and apply DM principles in ML, by helping them identify relevant techniques and understand underlying assumptions and trade-offs through a DM-centric lens.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML) 2026</p></details> |

We present evaluations both in simulation and in a zero-shot deployment of the trained policies in a physical robot setup, performing in-air unfolding of a variety of different cloth types, demonstrating the generalisation benefits of our proposed architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Protocol as Poetry: A Case Study of Pak's Smart Contract-Based Protocol Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12393v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protocol art has recently proliferated through blockchain-based smart contracts, building on a century-long lineage of conceptual, participatory, interactive, systematic, algorithmic, and generative art practices. Few studies have examined the characteristics and appreciation of this emerging art form. To address this gap, this paper presents an annotated portfolio analysis of protocol artworks by Pak, a pioneering and influential pseudonymous artist who treats smart contracts as medium and collective participation through protocol as message. Tracing the evolution from early open-edition releases of The Fungible (2021) and the dynamic mechanics of Merge (2021) to the soul-bound messaging of Censored (2022) and the reflective absence of Not Found (2023), we examine how Pak choreographs distributed agency across collectors and autonomous code, demonstrating how programmable protocols become a social fabric in artistic meaning-making. Through thematic analysis of Pak's works, we identify seven core characteristics distinguishing protocol art from other art forms: (1) system-centric rather than object-centric composition, (2) autonomous governance enabling open-ended control, (3) distributed agency and communal authorship, (4) temporal dynamism and lifecycle aesthetics, (5) economy-driven engagement, (6) poetic message embedded in interaction rituals, and (7) interoperability enabling composability for emergent complexity. We then discuss how these features set protocol art apart from adjacent movements such as conceptual, generative, participatory, interactive, and performance art. By analyzing principles grounded in Pak's practice, we contribute to the emerging literature on protocol art (or "protocolism") and offer design implications for future artists exploring this evolving form.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ARTECH 2025</p></details> |
| **[Elements of Robot Morphology: Supporting Designers in Robot Form Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09203v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot morphology, the form, shape, and structure of robots, is a key design space in human-robot interaction (HRI), shaping how robots function, express themselves, and interact with people. Yet, despite its importance, little is known about how design frameworks can guide systematic form exploration. To address this gap, we introduce Elements of Robot Morphology, a framework that identifies five fundamental elements: perception, articulation, end effectors, locomotion, and structure. Derived from an analysis of existing robots, the framework supports structured exploration of diverse robot forms. To operationalize the framework, we developed Morphology Exploration Blocks (MEB), a set of tangible blocks that enable hands-on, collaborative experimentation with robot morphologies. We evaluate the framework and toolkit through a case study and design workshops, showing how they support analysis, ideation, reflection, and collaborative robot design.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, Proceedings of the 21st ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI '26)</p></details> |
| **[Quecto-V1: Empirical Analysis of 8-bit Quantized Small Language Models for On-Device Legal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16640v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but has simultaneously created a "resource divide." State-of-the-art legal intelligence systems typically rely on massive parameter counts (7B+) and cloud-based inference, rendering them inaccessible to practitioners in resource-constrained environments and posing significant data sovereignty risks. This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) engineered to democratize access to Indian legal intelligence. Built upon a custom configuration of the GPT-2 architecture (124 million parameters), Quecto-V1 was trained from scratch exclusively on a corpus of Indian statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Constitution of India. Unlike generalist models, which prioritize broad world knowledge, our approach maximizes "lexical density" within the legal domain. Furthermore, we address the deployment bottleneck by applying post-training 8-bit quantization (GGUF format), compressing the model to a memory footprint of under 150 MB. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Quecto-V1 achieves high fidelity in retrieving statutory definitions and penal provisions, outperforming general-purpose SLMs in domain-specific exact match tasks while running entirely offline on consumer-grade CPUs. We further present an ablation study showing that 8-bit quantization yields a 74% reduction in model size with less than 3.5% degradation in retrieval accuracy compared to full-precision baselines. These findings suggest that for specialized, high-stakes domains like law, domain-specific training coupled with aggressive quantization offers a viable, privacy-preserving alternative to monolithic cloud models.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 tables |
| **[AREG: Adversarial Resource Extraction Game for Evaluating Persuasion and Resistance in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16639v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the social intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly requires moving beyond static text generation toward dynamic, adversarial interaction. We introduce the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG), a benchmark that operationalizes persuasion and resistance as a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation over financial resources. Using a round-robin tournament across frontier models, AREG enables joint evaluation of offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities within a single interactional framework. Our analysis provides evidence that these capabilities are weakly correlated ($ρ= 0.33$) and empirically dissociated: strong persuasive performance does not reliably predict strong resistance, and vice versa. Across all evaluated models, resistance scores exceed persuasion scores, indicating a systematic defensive advantage in adversarial dialogue settings. Further linguistic analysis suggests that interaction structure plays a central role in these outcomes. Incremental commitment-seeking strategies are associated with higher extraction success, while verification-seeking responses are more prevalent in successful defenses than explicit refusal. Together, these findings indicate that social influence in LLMs is not a monolithic capability and that evaluation frameworks focusing on persuasion alone may overlook asymmetric behavioral vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 11 tables.

| **[Forget Forgetting: Continual Learning in a World of Abundant Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07274v5)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) has traditionally focused on minimizing exemplar memory, a constraint often misaligned with modern systems where GPU time, not storage, is the primary bottleneck. This paper challenges this paradigm by investigating a more realistic regime: one where memory is abundant enough to mitigate forgetting, but full retraining from scratch remains prohibitively expensive. In this practical "middle ground", we find that the core challenge shifts from stability to plasticity, as models become biased toward prior tasks and struggle to learn new ones. Conversely, improved stability allows simple replay baselines to outperform the state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the GPU cost. To address this newly surfaced trade-off, we propose Weight Space Consolidation, a lightweight method that combines (1) rank-based parameter resets to restore plasticity with (2) weight averaging to enhance stability. Validated on both class-incremental learning with image classifiers and continual instruction tuning with large language models, our approach outperforms strong baselines while matching the low computational cost of replay, offering a scalable alternative to expensive full-retraining. These findings challenge long-standing CL assumptions and establish a new, cost-efficient baseline for real-world CL systems where exemplar memory is no longer the limiting factor.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |
| **[ColBERT-Zero: To Pre-train Or Not To Pre-train ColBERT models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16609v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art multi-vector models are obtained through a small Knowledge Distillation (KD) training step on top of strong single-vector models, leveraging the large-scale pre-training of these models. In this paper, we study the pre-training of multi-vector models and show that large-scale multi-vector pre-training yields much stronger multi-vector models. Notably, a fully ColBERT-pre-trained model, ColBERT-Zero, trained only on public data, outperforms GTE-ModernColBERT as well as its base model, GTE-ModernBERT, which leverages closed and much stronger data, setting new state-of-the-art for model this size. We also find that, although performing only a small KD step is not enough to achieve results close to full pre-training, adding a supervised step beforehand allows to achieve much closer performance while skipping the most costly unsupervised phase. Finally, we find that aligning the fine-tuning and pre-training setups is crucial when repurposing existing models. To enable exploration of our results, we release various checkpoints as well as code used to train them.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |

This study characterized trajectories of wearable-measured physical activity during the year preceding incident MDD diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective nested case-control study using linked electronic health record and Fitbit data from the All of Us Research Program. Adults with at least 6 months of valid wearable data in the year before diagnosis were eligible. Incident MDD cases were matched to controls on age, sex, body mass index, and index time (up to four controls per case). Daily step counts and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were aggregated into monthly averages. Linear mixed-effects models compared trajectories from 12 months before diagnosis to diagnosis. Within cases, contrasts identified when activity first significantly deviated from levels 12 months prior. The cohort included 4,104 participants (829 cases and 3,275 controls; 81.7% women; median age 48.4 years). Compared with controls, cases showed consistently lower activity and significant downward trajectories in both step counts and MVPA during the year before diagnosis (P < 0.001). Significant declines appeared about 4 months before diagnosis for step counts and 5 months for MVPA. Exploratory analyses suggested subgroup differences, including steeper declines in men, greater intensity reductions at older ages, and persistently low activity among individuals with obesity. Sustained within-person declines in physical activity emerged months before incident MDD diagnosis. Longitudinal wearable monitoring may provide early signals to support risk stratification and earlier intervention.</p></details> |  |
