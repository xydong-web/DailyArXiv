| **[Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials for Long-Range Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04668v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine-learning interatomic potentials have emerged as a revolutionary class of force-field models in molecular simulations, delivering quantum-mechanical accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost and enabling the simulation of large-scale systems over extended timescales. However, they often focus on modeling local environments, neglecting crucial long-range interactions. We propose a Sum-of-Gaussians Neural Network (SOG-Net), a lightweight and versatile framework for integrating long-range interactions into machine learning force field. The SOG-Net employs a latent-variable learning network that seamlessly bridges short-range and long-range components, coupled with an efficient Fourier convolution layer that incorporates long-range effects. By learning sum-of-Gaussians multipliers across different convolution layers, the SOG-Net adaptively captures diverse long-range decay behaviors while maintaining close-to-linear computational complexity during training and simulation via non-uniform fast Fourier transforms. The method is demonstrated effective for a broad range of long-range systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients. Code and data are available at https://github.com/panliangrui/NIPS2025/.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission is being withdrawn because we identified issues in the analysis that may affect the results.

| **[Vibrational Fingerprints of Strained Polymers: A Spectroscopic Pathway to Mechanical State Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16266v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vibrational response of polymer networks under load provides a sensitive probe of molecular deformation and a route to non-destructive diagnostics. Here we show that machine-learned force fields reproduce these spectroscopic fingerprints with quantum-level fidelity in realistic epoxy thermosets. Using MACE-OFF23 molecular dynamics, we capture the experimentally observed redshifts of para-phenylene stretching modes under tensile load, in contrast to the harmonic OPLS-AA model. These shifts correlate with molecular elongation and alignment, consistent with Badger's rule, directly linking vibrational features to local stress. To capture IR intensities, we trained a symmetry-adapted dipole moment model on representative epoxy fragments, enabling validation of strain responses. Together, these approaches provide chemically accurate and computationally accessible predictions of strain-dependent vibrational spectra. Our results establish vibrational fingerprints as predictive markers of mechanical state in polymer networks, pointing to new strategies for stress mapping and structural-health diagnostics in advanced materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Multilevel Energy-Based Fragmentation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12467v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy-based fragmentation methods approximate the potential energy of a molecular system as a sum of contribution terms built from the energies of particular subsystems. Some such methods reduce to truncations of the many-body expansion (MBE); others combine subsystem energies in a manner inspired by the principle of inclusion/exclusion (PIE). The combinatorial technique of M\"obius inversion of sums over partially ordered sets, which generalizes the PIE, is known to provide a non-recursive expression for the MBE contribution terms, and has also been connected to related cluster expansion methods. We build from these ideas a very general framework for decomposing potential functions into energetic contribution terms associated with elements of particular partially ordered sets (posets) and direct products thereof. Specific choices immediately reproduce not only the MBE, but also a number of other existing decomposition forms, including, e.g., the multilevel ML-BOSSANOVA schema. Furthermore, a different choice of poset product leads to a setup familiar from the combination technique for high-dimensional approximation, which has a known connection to quantum-chemical composite methods. We present the ML-SUPANOVA decomposition form, which allows the further refinement of the terms of an MBE-like expansion of the Born-Oppenheimer potential according to systematic hierarchies of ab initio methods and of basis sets. We outline an adaptive algorithm for the a posteori construction of quasi-optimal truncations of this decomposition. Some initial experiments are reported and discussed.</p></details> |  |

| **[EDBench: Large-Scale Electron Density Data for Molecular Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09262v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing molecular machine learning force fields (MLFFs) generally focus on the learning of atoms, molecules, and simple quantum chemical properties (such as energy and force), but ignore the importance of electron density (ED) $\rho(r)$ in accurately understanding molecular force fields (MFFs). ED describes the probability of finding electrons at specific locations around atoms or molecules, which uniquely determines all ground state properties (such as energy, molecular structure, etc.) of interactive multi-particle systems according to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, the calculation of ED relies on the time-consuming first-principles density functional theory (DFT) which leads to the lack of large-scale ED data and limits its application in MLFFs. In this paper, we introduce EDBench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ED designed to advance learning-based research at the electronic scale. Built upon the PCQM4Mv2, EDBench provides accurate ED data, covering 3.3 million molecules. To comprehensively evaluate the ability of models to understand and utilize electronic information, we design a suite of ED-centric benchmark tasks spanning prediction, retrieval, and generation. Our evaluation on several state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that learning from EDBench is not only feasible but also achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we show that learning-based method can efficiently calculate ED with comparable precision while significantly reducing the computational cost relative to traditional DFT calculations. All data and benchmarks from EDBench will be freely available, laying a robust foundation for ED-driven drug discovery and materials science.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Discovery of Sustainable Refrigerants through Physics-Informed RL Fine-Tuning of Sequence Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19588v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most refrigerants currently used in air-conditioning systems, such as hydrofluorocarbons, are potent greenhouse gases and are being phased down. Large-scale molecular screening has been applied to the search for alternatives, but in practice only about 300 refrigerants are known, and only a few additional candidates have been suggested without experimental validation. This scarcity of reliable data limits the effectiveness of purely data-driven methods. We present Refgen, a generative pipeline that integrates machine learning with physics-grounded inductive biases. Alongside fine-tuning for valid molecular generation, Refgen incorporates predictive models for critical properties, equations of state, thermochemical polynomials, and full vapor compression cycle simulations. These models enable reinforcement learning fine-tuning under thermodynamic constraints, enforcing consistency and guiding discovery toward molecules that balance efficiency, safety, and environmental impact. By embedding physics into the learning process, Refgen leverages scarce data effectively and enables de novo refrigerant discovery beyond the known set of compounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frame-based Equivariant Diffusion Models for 3D Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19506v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity, we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention. On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale, alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of global structure preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Algorithms for Adversarially Robust Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19100v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the widespread use of deep learning models in safety-critical applications, ensuring that the decisions of such models are robust against adversarial exploitation is of fundamental importance. In this thesis, we discuss recent progress toward designing algorithms that exhibit desirable robustness properties. First, we discuss the problem of adversarial examples in computer vision, for which we introduce new technical results, training paradigms, and certification algorithms. Next, we consider the problem of domain generalization, wherein the task is to train neural networks to generalize from a family of training distributions to unseen test distributions. We present new algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art generalization in medical imaging, molecular identification, and image classification. Finally, we study the setting of jailbreaking large language models (LLMs), wherein an adversarial user attempts to design prompts that elicit objectionable content from an LLM. We propose new attacks and defenses, which represent the frontier of progress toward designing robust language-based agents.</p></details> | PhD thesis |
| **[Test-Time Training Scaling Laws for Chemical Exploration in Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19153v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical Language Models (CLMs) leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) have shown promise in de novo molecular design, yet often suffer from mode collapse, limiting their exploration capabilities. Inspired by Test-Time Training (TTT) in large language models, we propose scaling TTT for CLMs to enhance chemical space exploration. We introduce MolExp, a novel benchmark emphasizing the discovery of structurally diverse molecules with similar bioactivity, simulating real-world drug design challenges. Our results demonstrate that scaling TTT by increasing the number of independent RL agents follows a log-linear scaling law, significantly improving exploration efficiency as measured by MolExp. In contrast, increasing TTT training time yields diminishing returns, even with exploration bonuses. We further evaluate cooperative RL strategies to enhance exploration efficiency. These findings provide a scalable framework for generative molecular design, offering insights into optimizing AI-driven drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Graph Neural Networks and Dataset for Robust Olfactory Navigation in Hazard Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00455v4)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation by scent is a capability in robotic systems that is rising in demand. However, current methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address challenges in olfactory navigation, we introduce a multimodal olfaction dataset along with a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines. This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and training methods, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors, enabling them to detect more compounds and inform better hardware design. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound in critical applications such as explosives detection, narcotics screening, and search and rescue. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities. Code, models, and data are made available to the community at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/kordelfrance/olfaction-vision-language-dataset.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Quantum Generative Adversarial Autoencoders: Learning latent representations for quantum data generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16186v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce the Quantum Generative Adversarial Autoencoder (QGAA), a quantum model for generation of quantum data. The QGAA consists of two components: (a) Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) to compress quantum states, and (b) Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) to learn the latent space of the trained QAE. This approach imparts the QAE with generative capabilities. The utility of QGAA is demonstrated in two representative scenarios: (a) generation of pure entangled states, and (b) generation of parameterized molecular ground states for H$_2$ and LiH. The average errors in the energies estimated by the trained QGAA are 0.02 Ha for H$_2$ and 0.06 Ha for LiH in simulations upto 6 qubits. These results illustrate the potential of QGAA for quantum state generation, quantum chemistry, and near-term quantum machine learning applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 28 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Molecule Synthesizability with Chain-of-Reaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16084v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A well-known pitfall of molecular generative models is that they are not guaranteed to generate synthesizable molecules. There have been considerable attempts to address this problem, but given the exponentially large combinatorial space of synthesizable molecules, existing methods have shown limited coverage of the space and poor molecular optimization performance. To tackle these problems, we introduce ReaSyn, a generative framework for synthesizable projection where the model explores the neighborhood of given molecules in the synthesizable space by generating pathways that result in synthesizable analogs. To fully utilize the chemical knowledge contained in the synthetic pathways, we propose a novel perspective that views synthetic pathways akin to reasoning paths in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, we introduce the chain-of-reaction (CoR) notation that explicitly states reactants, reaction types, and intermediate products for each step in a pathway. With the CoR notation, ReaSyn can get dense supervision in every reaction step to explicitly learn chemical reaction rules during supervised training and perform step-by-step reasoning. In addition, to further enhance the reasoning capability of ReaSyn, we propose reinforcement learning (RL)-based finetuning and goal-directed test-time compute scaling tailored for synthesizable projection. ReaSyn achieves the highest reconstruction rate and pathway diversity in synthesizable molecule reconstruction and the highest optimization performance in synthesizable goal-directed molecular optimization, and significantly outperforms previous synthesizable projection methods in synthesizable hit expansion. These results highlight ReaSyn's superior ability to navigate combinatorially-large synthesizable chemical space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion with Multiple Experts for Protein Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15796v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of protein design is to generate amino acid sequences that fold into functional structures with desired properties. Prior methods combining autoregressive language models with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) struggle with long-range dependencies and suffer from an impractically large search space. We propose MCTD-ME, Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion with Multiple Experts, which integrates masked diffusion models with tree search to enable multi-token planning and efficient exploration. Unlike autoregressive planners, MCTD-ME uses biophysical-fidelity-enhanced diffusion denoising as the rollout engine, jointly revising multiple positions and scaling to large sequence spaces. It further leverages experts of varying capacities to enrich exploration, guided by a pLDDT-based masking schedule that targets low-confidence regions while preserving reliable residues. We propose a novel multi-expert selection rule (PH-UCT-ME) extends predictive-entropy UCT to expert ensembles. On the inverse folding task (CAMEO and PDB benchmarks), MCTD-ME outperforms single-expert and unguided baselines in both sequence recovery (AAR) and structural similarity (scTM), with gains increasing for longer proteins and benefiting from multi-expert guidance. More generally, the framework is model-agnostic and applicable beyond inverse folding, including de novo protein engineering and multi-objective molecular generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SubDyve: Subgraph-Driven Dynamic Propagation for Virtual Screening Enhancement Controlling False Positive](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16273v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual screening (VS) aims to identify bioactive compounds from vast chemical libraries, but remains difficult in low-label regimes where only a few actives are known. Existing methods largely rely on general-purpose molecular fingerprints and overlook class-discriminative substructures critical to bioactivity. Moreover, they consider molecules independently, limiting effectiveness in low-label regimes. We introduce SubDyve, a network-based VS framework that constructs a subgraph-aware similarity network and propagates activity signals from a small known actives. When few active compounds are available, SubDyve performs iterative seed refinement, incrementally promoting new candidates based on local false discovery rate. This strategy expands the seed set with promising candidates while controlling false positives from topological bias and overexpansion. We evaluate SubDyve on ten DUD-E targets under zero-shot conditions and on the CDK7 target with a 10-million-compound ZINC dataset. SubDyve consistently outperforms existing fingerprint or embedding-based approaches, achieving margins of up to +34.0 on the BEDROC and +24.6 on the EF1% metric.</p></details> | 33 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Fast reconstruction of degenerate populations of conductance-based neuron models from spike times](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12783v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neurons communicate through spikes, and spike timing is a crucial part of neuronal processing. Spike times can be recorded experimentally both intracellularly and extracellularly, and are the main output of state-of-the-art neural probes. On the other hand, neuronal activity is controlled at the molecular level by the currents generated by many different transmembrane proteins called ion channels. Connecting spike timing to ion channel composition remains an arduous task to date. To address this challenge, we developed a method that combines deep learning with a theoretical tool called Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs), which reduce the complexity of ion channel interactions into three interpretable components describing how neurons spike. Our approach uses deep learning to infer DICs directly from spike times and then generates populations of "twin" neuron models that replicate the observed activity while capturing natural variability in membrane channel composition. The method is fast, accurate, and works using only spike recordings. We also provide open-source software with a graphical interface, making it accessible to researchers without programming expertise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speak-to-Structure: Evaluating LLMs in Open-domain Natural Language-Driven Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14642v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in natural language-driven molecule discovery. However, existing datasets and benchmarks for molecule-text alignment are predominantly built on a one-to-one mapping, measuring LLMs' ability to retrieve a single, pre-defined answer, rather than their creative potential to generate diverse, yet equally valid, molecular candidates. To address this critical gap, we propose Speak-to-Structure (S^2-Bench}), the first benchmark to evaluate LLMs in open-domain natural language-driven molecule generation. S^2-Bench is specifically designed for one-to-many relationships, challenging LLMs to demonstrate genuine molecular understanding and generation capabilities. Our benchmark includes three key tasks: molecule editing (MolEdit), molecule optimization (MolOpt), and customized molecule generation (MolCustom), each probing a different aspect of molecule discovery. We also introduce OpenMolIns, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset that enables Llama-3.1-8B to surpass the most powerful LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on S^2-Bench. Our comprehensive evaluation of 28 LLMs shifts the focus from simple pattern recall to realistic molecular design, paving the way for more capable LLMs in natural language-driven molecule discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our codes and datasets are available through https://github.com/phenixace/TOMG-Bench</p></details> |

Traditional generative models often struggle with limited training data, particularly in drug discovery, where molecular datasets for specific therapeutic targets, such as nucleic acids binders and central nervous system (CNS) drugs, are scarce. ADSeqGAN addresses this challenge by integrating an auxiliary random forest classifier as an additional discriminator into the GAN framework, significantly improves molecular generation quality and class specificity. Our method incorporates pretrained generator and Wasserstein distance to enhance training stability and diversity. We evaluate ADSeqGAN across three representative cases. First, on nucleic acid- and protein-targeting molecules, ADSeqGAN shows superior capability in generating nucleic acid binders compared to baseline models. Second, through oversampling, it markedly improves CNS drug generation, achieving higher yields than traditional de novo models. Third, in cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) ligand design, ADSeqGAN generates novel druglike molecules, with 32.8\% predicted actives surpassing hit rates of CB1-focused and general-purpose libraries when assessed by a target-specific LRIP-SF scoring function. Overall, ADSeqGAN offers a versatile framework for molecular design in data-scarce scenarios, with demonstrated applications in nucleic acid binders, CNS drugs, and CB1 ligands.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, ASAP</p></details> |

| **[Exploring Graph-Transformer Out-of-Distribution Generalization Abilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20575v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts. Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without specialized DG algorithms (on four out of six benchmarks). Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets, specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Highlighting its model-agnostic design, the method yielded valuable insights into both GT and MPNN backbones and appears well suited for broader DG applications beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Variate Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20311v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Simple Graphs: Neural Multi-Objective Routing on Multigraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22095v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model, which is more scalable, first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically, across a wide range of problems and graph distributions, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to strong heuristics and neural baselines.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 Figures |
| **[Heterogeneous Directed Hypergraph Neural Network over abstract syntax tree (AST) for Code Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04228v6)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code classification is a difficult issue in program understanding and automatic coding. Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural network (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 35th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2023) as a regular paper; the latest version is consistent with the official conference version</p></details> |

Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging learning framework to collaboratively train graph data from various clients. Although FGL allows client data to remain localized, a malicious server can still steal client private data information through uploaded gradient. In this paper, we for the first time propose label distribution attacks (LDAs) on FGL that aim to infer the label distributions of the client-side data. Firstly, we observe that the effectiveness of LDA is closely related to the variance of node embeddings in GNNs. Next, we analyze the relation between them and propose a new attack named EC-LDA, which significantly improves the attack effectiveness by compressing node embeddings. Then, extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks across six widely used graph datasets show that EC-LDA outperforms the SOTA LDAs. Specifically, EC-LDA can achieve the Cos-sim as high as 1.0 under almost all cases. Finally, we explore the robustness of EC-LDA under differential privacy protection and discuss the potential effective defense methods to EC-LDA. Our code is available at https://github.com/cheng-t/EC-LDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by 2025 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[The Iterative Chainlet Partitioning Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone and Neural Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15147v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces the Iterative Chainlet Partitioning (ICP) algorithm and its neural acceleration for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone (TSP-D). The proposed ICP algorithm decomposes a TSP-D solution into smaller segments called chainlets, each optimized individually by a dynamic programming subroutine. The chainlet with the highest improvement is updated, and the procedure is repeated until no further improvement is possible. We show that the subroutine runs in quadratic time and the number of subroutine calls is bounded linearly in problem size for the first iteration and remains constant in subsequent iterations, ensuring algorithmic scalability. Empirical results show that ICP outperforms existing algorithms in both solution quality and computational time. Tested over 1,249 benchmark instances, ICP yields an average improvement of 2.6\% in solution quality over the previous state-of-the-art algorithm while reducing computational time by 91.3\%. The procedure is deterministic, ensuring reliability without requiring multiple runs. The subroutine is the computational bottleneck in the already efficient ICP algorithm. To reduce the necessity of subroutine calls, we integrate a graph neural network (GNN) to predict incremental improvements. We demonstrate that the resulting Neuro ICP (NICP) achieves substantial acceleration while maintaining solution quality. Compared to ICP, NICP reduces the total computational time by 28.6\%, while the objective function value increase is limited to 0.14\%.

We introduce the first implementation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth method specifically tailored for data-driven AR prediction, leveraging historical derivative information to enhance numerical stability without additional computational overhead. To validate our approach, we systematically evaluate time integration schemes across canonical 2D PDEs before extending to complex Navier-Stokes cylinder vortex shedding dynamics. Additionally, we develop three novel adaptive weighting strategies that dynamically adjust the importance of different future time steps during multi-step rollout training. Our analysis reveals that as physical complexity increases, such sophisticated rollout techniques become essential, with the Adams-Bashforth scheme demonstrating consistent robustness across investigated systems and our best adaptive approach delivering an 89% improvement over conventional fixed-weight methods while maintaining similar computational costs. For the complex Navier-Stokes vortex shedding problem, despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps reducing mean squared error from 0.125 (single-step direct prediction) to 0.002 (Adams-Bashforth with proposed multi-step rollout). Our integrated methodology demonstrates an 83% improvement over standard noise injection techniques and maintains robustness under severe spatial constraints; specifically, when trained on only a partial spatial domain, it still achieves 58% and 27% improvements over direct prediction and forward Euler methods, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Text Semantics and Graph Structures for Temporal Text-attributed Graphs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14411v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have shown remarkable performance in temporal graph modeling. However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{CROSS}, a flexible framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. CROSS is designed by decomposing the TTAG modeling process into two phases: (i) temporal semantics extraction; and (ii) semantic-structural information unification. The key idea is to advance the large language models (LLMs) to dynamically extract the temporal semantics in text space and then generate cohesive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the CROSS framework, which empowers LLMs to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that CROSS achieves state-of-the-art results on four public datasets and one industrial dataset, with 24.7% absolute MRR gain on average in temporal link prediction and 3.7% AUC gain in node classification of industrial application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Decentralized Learning Strategies for Estimation Error Minimization with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03227v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of sampling and remote estimation for autoregressive Markovian processes in a multi-hop wireless network with statistically-identical agents. Agents cache the most recent samples from others and communicate over wireless collision channels governed by an underlying graph topology. Our goal is to minimize time-average estimation error and/or age of information with decentralized scalable sampling and transmission policies, considering both oblivious (where decision-making is independent of the physical processes) and non-oblivious policies (where decision-making depends on physical processes). We prove that in oblivious policies, minimizing estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the age of information. The complexity of the problem, especially the multi-dimensional action spaces and arbitrary network topologies, makes theoretical methods for finding optimal transmission policies intractable. We optimize the policies using a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where each agent employs a permutation-equivariant graph neural network architecture. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed framework exhibits desirable transferability properties, allowing transmission policies trained on small- or moderate-size networks to be executed effectively on large-scale topologies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) The trained policies are transferable to larger networks, and their performance gains increase with the number of agents; (iii) The training procedure withstands non-stationarity even if we utilize independent learning techniques; and, (iv) Recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity in independent learning.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel framework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical parameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that learns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic, sand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics parameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point trajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations generated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel spatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and incorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical plausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic, physics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video models, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility.

The primary obstacle is that the explicit positional encodings(PE), such as RoPE, need extrapolating to unseen positions which degrades performance when the inference resolution differs from training. In this paper, We propose a Length-Extrapolatable Diffusion Transformer~(LEDiT) to overcome this limitation. LEDiT needs no explicit PEs, thereby avoiding PE extrapolation. The key innovation of LEDiT lies in the use of causal attention. We demonstrate that causal attention can implicitly encode global positional information and show that such information facilitates extrapolation. We further introduce a locality enhancement module, which captures fine-grained local information to complement the global coarse-grained position information encoded by causal attention. Experimental results on both conditional and text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that LEDiT supports up to 4x resolution scaling (e.g., from 256x256 to 512x512), achieving better image quality compared to the state-of-the-art length extrapolation methods. We believe that LEDiT marks a departure from the standard RoPE-based methods and offers a promising insight into length extrapolation.

To complete many common tasks, relevant objects are required to pass in and out of a robot's field of view. In these settings, spatial memory - the ability to remember the spatial composition of the scene - is an important competency. However, building such mechanisms into robot learning systems remains an open research problem. We introduce mindmap (Spatial Memory in Deep Feature Maps for 3D Action Policies), a 3D diffusion policy that generates robot trajectories based on a semantic 3D reconstruction of the environment. We show in simulation experiments that our approach is effective at solving tasks where state-of-the-art approaches without memory mechanisms struggle. We release our reconstruction system, training code, and evaluation tasks to spur research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025 Workshop RemembeRL</p></details> |

Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/NeurIPS-938.</p></details> |  |

Beyond image guidance, recent studies have explored incorporating text guidance to achieve identity-preserved yet locally editable object inpainting. However, these methods still suffer from identity overfitting, where original attributes remain entangled with target textual instructions. To overcome this limitation, we propose DreamMix, a diffusion-based framework adept at inserting target objects into user-specified regions while concurrently enabling arbitrary text-driven attribute modifications. DreamMix introduces three key components: (i) an Attribute Decoupling Mechanism (ADM) that synthesizes diverse attribute-augmented image-text pairs to mitigate overfitting; (ii) a Textual Attribute Substitution (TAS) module that isolates target attributes via orthogonal decomposition, and (iii) a Disentangled Inpainting Framework (DIF) that seperates local generation from global harmonization. Extensive experiments across multiple inpainting backbones demonstrate that DreamMix achieves a superior balance between identity preservation and attribute editability across diverse applications, including object insertion, attribute editing, and small object inpainting.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnchDrive: Bootstrapping Diffusion Policies with Hybrid Trajectory Anchors for End-to-End Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20253v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end multi-modal planning has become a transformative paradigm in autonomous driving, effectively addressing behavioral multi-modality and the generalization challenge in long-tail scenarios. We propose AnchDrive, a framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models. Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features. The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse, high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong gen?eralizability</p></details> | IWACIII 2025 |
| **[4D Driving Scene Generation With Stereo Forcing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20251v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. Bridging generation and novel view synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified framework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with geometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera parameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting representations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis leverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture supports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including geometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a geometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as priors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address geometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising. This method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative influence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both appearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view synthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance in downstream evaluations.

| **[Latent Wavelet Diffusion For Ultra-High-Resolution Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00433v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution image synthesis remains a core challenge in generative modeling, particularly in balancing computational efficiency with the preservation of fine-grained visual detail. We present Latent Wavelet Diffusion (LWD), a lightweight training framework that significantly improves detail and texture fidelity in ultra-high-resolution (2K-4K) image synthesis. LWD introduces a novel, frequency-aware masking strategy derived from wavelet energy maps, which dynamically focuses the training process on detail-rich regions of the latent space. This is complemented by a scale-consistent VAE objective to ensure high spectral fidelity. The primary advantage of our approach is its efficiency: LWD requires no architectural modifications and adds zero additional cost during inference, making it a practical solution for scaling existing models. Across multiple strong baselines, LWD consistently improves perceptual quality and FID scores, demonstrating the power of signal-driven supervision as a principled and efficient path toward high-resolution generative modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Curriculum: Synthetic-to-Real Generative Curriculum Learning via Image-Guided Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13674v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-quality or scarce data has posed significant challenges for training deep neural networks in practice. While classical data augmentation cannot contribute very different new data, diffusion models opens up a new door to build self-evolving AI by generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data through text-guided prompts. However, text-only guidance cannot control synthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting in out-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome the limitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolations between synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generated images are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weaker image guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute to a larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrum of data enables us to build a novel "Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL)". DisCL adjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: It identifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the most effective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. We apply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification and learning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images of high-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learning higher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensive experiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy when applying DisCL to iWildCam dataset. On ImageNet-LT, DisCL improves the base model's tail-class accuracy from 4.4% to 23.64% and leads to a 4.02% improvement in all-class accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCV2025. 22 pages, including references and appendix.

| **[Learning hidden cascades via classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11228v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spreading dynamics in social networks are often studied under the assumption that individuals' statuses, whether informed or infected, are fully observable. However, in many real-world situations, such statuses remain unobservable, which is crucial for determining an individual's potential to further spread the infection. While final statuses are hidden, intermediate indicators such as symptoms of infection are observable and provide useful representations of the underlying diffusion process. We propose a partial observability-aware Machine Learning framework to learn the characteristics of the spreading model. We term the method Distribution Classification, which utilizes the power of classifiers to infer the underlying transmission dynamics. Through extensive benchmarking against Approximate Bayesian Computation and GNN-based baselines, our framework consistently outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering accurate parameter estimates across diverse diffusion settings while scaling efficiently to large networks. We validate the method on synthetic networks and extend the study to a real-world insider trading network, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing spreading phenomena where direct observation of individual statuses is not possible.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing works treat speech features as a monolithic representation and fail to capture their fine-grained roles in driving different facial motions, while also overlooking the importance of modeling keyframes with intense dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KSDiff, a Keyframe-Augmented Speech-Aware Dual-Path Diffusion framework. Specifically, the raw audio and transcript are processed by a Dual-Path Speech Encoder (DPSE) to disentangle expression-related and head-pose-related features, while an autoregressive Keyframe Establishment Learning (KEL) module predicts the most salient motion frames. These components are integrated into a Dual-path Motion generator to synthesize coherent and realistic facial motions. Extensive experiments on HDTF and VoxCeleb demonstrate that KSDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements in both lip synchronization accuracy and head-pose naturalness. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining speech disentanglement with keyframe-aware diffusion for talking-head generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, these methods remain constrained by the limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges, we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable solution for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[First-Extinction Law for Resampling Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20101v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extinction times in resampling processes are fundamental yet often intractable, as previous formulas scale as $2^M$ with the number of states $M$ present in the initial probability distribution. We solve this by treating multinomial updates as independent square-root diffusions of zero drift, yielding a closed-form law for the first-extinction time. We prove that the mean coincides exactly with the Wright-Fisher result of Baxter et al., thereby replacing exponential-cost evaluations with a linear-cost expression, and we validate this result through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrate predictive power for model collapse in a simple self-training setup: the onset of collapse coincides with the resampling-driven first-extinction time computed from the model's initial stationary distribution. These results hint to a unified view of resampling extinction dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Real-world observational data are inherently incomplete and irregularly sampled, posing significant challenges for existing data-driven approaches. In this work, we propose a principled diffusion-based framework for learning physical systems from incomplete training samples. To this end, our method strategically partitions each such sample into observed context and unobserved query components through a carefully designed splitting strategy, then trains a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct the missing query portions given available contexts. This formulation enables accurate imputation across arbitrary observation patterns without requiring complete data supervision. Specifically, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our diffusion training paradigm on incomplete data achieves asymptotic convergence to the true complete generative process under mild regularity conditions. Empirically, we show that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines on synthetic and real-world physical dynamics benchmarks, including fluid flows and weather systems, with particularly strong performance in limited and irregular observation regimes. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretically principled approach for learning and imputing partially observed dynamics.</p></details> |  |

While extensive research has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object counting, these tasks cover only the most elementary layer of spatial reasoning and are largely approaching saturation in the latest reasoning models. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology. OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained subcategories. Through careful manual annotation, we construct over 8.4K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both open- and closed-source VLMs exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial reasoning.

To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door", "approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper", etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://bpiyush.github.io/lift-website/</p></details> |

This is a nontrivial extension of the TPD method [Chen et al.

Comprehensive numerical experiments spanning from 1D to 3D settings demonstrate that our method achieves superior computational efficiency compared to existing methods, highlighting its broad applicability through several challenging simulations.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

Using a structured, reason-then-estimate pipeline on street-view imagery, GPT-4o infers neighborhood poverty and tree canopy, which we embed in a quasi-experimental design evaluating the legacy of 1930s redlining. GPT-4o recovers the expected adverse socio-environmental legacy effects of redlining, with estimates statistically indistinguishable from authoritative sources, and it outperforms a conventional pixel-based segmentation baseline-consistent with the idea that holistic scene reasoning extracts higher-order information beyond object counts alone. These results position MLLMs as policy-grade instruments for neighborhood measurement and motivate broader validation across policy-evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |

A Benchmark and Systematic Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13939v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual counting is a fundamental yet challenging task, especially when users need to count objects of a specific type in complex scenes. While recent models, including class-agnostic counting models and large vision-language models (VLMs), show promise in counting tasks, their ability to perform fine-grained, intent-driven counting remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce PairTally, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate fine-grained visual counting. Each of the 681 high-resolution images in PairTally contains two object categories, requiring models to distinguish and count based on subtle differences in shape, size, color, or semantics. The dataset includes both inter-category (distinct categories) and intra-category (closely related subcategories) settings, making it suitable for rigorous evaluation of selective counting capabilities. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art models, including exemplar-based methods, language-prompted models, and large VLMs. Our results show that despite recent advances, current models struggle to reliably count what users intend, especially in fine-grained and visually ambiguous cases. PairTally provides a new foundation for diagnosing and improving fine-grained visual counting systems.</p></details> |  |

Instead, we propose an alternative paradigm: Given a category name, tune a compact concept embedding derived from the prompt using synthetic images and pseudo-labels generated by a text-to-image diffusion model. This embedding conditions a specialization module that refines raw overcounts from any frozen counter into accurate, category-specific estimates\textemdash without requiring real images or human annotations.

To address this gap, we introduce MITS (Multimodal Intelligent Traffic Surveillance), the first large-scale multimodal benchmark dataset specifically designed for ITS. MITS includes 170,400 independently collected real-world ITS images sourced from traffic surveillance cameras, annotated with eight main categories and 24 subcategories of ITS-specific objects and events under diverse environmental conditions. Additionally, through a systematic data generation pipeline, we generate high-quality image captions and 5 million instruction-following visual question-answer pairs, addressing five critical ITS tasks: object and event recognition, object counting, object localization, background analysis, and event reasoning. To demonstrate MITS's effectiveness, we fine-tune mainstream LMMs on this dataset, enabling the development of ITS-specific applications. Experimental results show that MITS significantly improves LMM performance in ITS applications, increasing LLaVA-1.5's performance from 0.494 to 0.905 (+83.2%), LLaVA-1.6's from 0.678 to 0.921 (+35.8%), Qwen2-VL's from 0.584 to 0.926 (+58.6%), and Qwen2.5-VL's from 0.732 to 0.930 (+27.0%). We release the dataset, code, and models as open-source, providing high-value resources to advance both ITS and LMM research.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by Image and Vision Computing</p></details> |
| **[Visual Representation Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07979v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning. We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/VIRAL/</p></details> |
| **[City Sampling for Citizens' Assemblies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07557v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In citizens' assemblies, a group of constituents is randomly selected to weigh in on policy issues. We study a two-stage sampling problem faced by practitioners in countries such as Germany, in which constituents' contact information is stored at a municipal level. As a result, practitioners can only select constituents from a bounded number of cities ex post, while ensuring equal selection probability for constituents ex ante. We develop several algorithms for this problem. Although minimizing the number of contacted cities is NP-hard, we provide a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm and an additive 1-approximation, both based on separation oracles for a linear programming formulation. Recognizing that practical objectives go beyond minimizing city count, we further introduce a simple and more interpretable greedy algorithm, which additionally satisfies an ex-post monotonicity property and achieves an additive 2-approximation. Finally, we explore a notion of ex-post proportionality, for which we propose two practical algorithms: an optimal algorithm based on column generation and integer linear programming and a simple heuristic creating particularly transparent distributions. We evaluate these algorithms on data from Germany, and plan to deploy them in cooperation with a leading nonprofit organization in this space.</p></details> |  |
| **[CountQA: How Well Do MLLMs Count in the Wild?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06585v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable fluency in understanding visual scenes, yet they exhibit a critical lack in a fundamental cognitive skill: object counting. This blind spot severely limits their reliability in real-world applications. To date, this capability has been largely unevaluated in complex scenarios, as existing benchmarks either feature sparse object densities or are confined to specific visual domains, failing to test models under realistic conditions. Addressing this gap, we introduce CountQA, a challenging new benchmark designed to probe this deficiency. Comprising over 1,500 question-answer pairs, CountQA features real-world images with high object density, clutter, and occlusion. We investigate this weakness by evaluating 15 prominent MLLMs on the CountQA benchmark and reveal that the top-performing model achieves a mere 42.9% accuracy, with performance declining as object counts rise. By providing a dedicated benchmark to diagnose and rectify this core weakness, CountQA paves the way for a new generation of MLLMs that are not only descriptively fluent but also numerically grounded and spatially aware. We will open-source the dataset and code upon paper acceptance to foster further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causal Lens for Evaluating Faithfulness Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18848v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer natural language explanations as an alternative to feature attribution methods for model interpretability. However, despite their plausibility, they may not reflect the model's true reasoning faithfully, which is crucial for understanding the model's true decision-making processes. Although several faithfulness metrics have been proposed, they are often evaluated in isolation, making direct, principled comparisons between them difficult. Here, we present Causal Diagnosticity, a framework that serves as a common testbed to evaluate faithfulness metrics for natural language explanations. Our framework employs the concept of diagnosticity, and uses model-editing methods to generate faithful-unfaithful explanation pairs. Our benchmark includes four tasks: fact-checking, analogy, object counting, and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate prominent faithfulness metrics, including post-hoc explanation and chain-of-thought-based methods. We find that diagnostic performance varies across tasks and models, with Filler Tokens performing best overall. Additionally, continuous metrics are generally more diagnostic than binary ones but can be sensitive to noise and model choice. Our results highlight the need for more robust faithfulness metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 22 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 (highlight)</p></details> |

In this work, we aimed to assess existing design heuristics for categorical visualization using well-established psychological knowledge. Specifically, we examine the impact of the subitizing phenomenon in cognitive psychology -- people's ability to automatically recognize a small set of objects instantly without counting -- in data visualizations. We conducted three experiments with multi-class scatterplots -- between 2 and 15 classes with varying design choices -- across three different tasks -- class estimation, correlation comparison, and clustering judgments -- to understand how performance changes as the number of classes (and therefore set size) increases. Our results indicate if the category number is smaller than six, people tend to perform well at all tasks, providing empirical evidence of subitizing in visualization. When category numbers increased, performance fell, with the magnitude of the performance change depending on task and encoding. Our study bridges the gap between heuristic guidelines and empirical evidence by applying well-established psychological theories, suggesting future opportunities for using psychological theories and constructs to characterize visualization perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[SATURN: Autoregressive Image Generation Guided by Scene Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14502v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from 56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78, outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art autoregressive fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MAPR 2025</p></details> |

We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation, where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score of 0.97.</p></details> |  |
| **[UAV-VL-R1: Generalizing Vision-Language Models via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Multi-Stage GRPO for UAV Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11196v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints. These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting, transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marmot: Object-Level Self-Correction via Multi-Agent Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20054v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential solution involves employing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to construct a self-correction framework. However, these approaches heavily rely on the capabilities of the MLLMs used, often fail to account for all objects within the image, and suffer from cumulative distortions during multi-round editing processes. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting to enhance image-text alignment. First, we employ a large language model as an Object-Aware Agent to perform object-level divide-and-conquer, automatically decomposing self-correction tasks into object-centric subtasks based on image descriptions. For each subtask, we construct an Object Correction System featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism that operates exclusively on a single object's segmentation mask or the bounding boxes of object pairs, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To efficiently integrate correction results from subtasks while avoiding cumulative distortions from multi-stage editing, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother, which employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtasks, significantly improving runtime efficiency while preventing distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CountCluster: Training-Free Object Quantity Guidance with Cross-Attention Map Clustering for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10710v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose \textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity control performance across a variety of prompts.

We introduce Redemption Score(RS), a novel hybrid framework that ranks image captions by triangulating three complementary signals: (1) Mutual Information Divergence (MID) for global image-text distributional alignment, (2) DINO-based perceptual similarity of cycle-generated images for visual grounding, and (3) LLM Text Embeddings for contextual text similarity against human references. A calibrated fusion of these signals allows RS to offer a more holistic assessment. On the Flickr8k benchmark, RS achieves a Kendall-$\tau$ of 58.42, outperforming most prior methods and demonstrating superior correlation with human judgments without requiring task-specific training. Our framework provides a more robust and nuanced evaluation by thoroughly examining both the visual accuracy and text quality together, with consistent performance across Conceptual Captions and MS COCO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Image Captioning Descriptiveness by Ranking and LLM-based Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11593v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-The-Art (SoTA) image captioning models are often trained on the MicroSoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) dataset, which contains human-annotated captions with an average length of approximately ten tokens. Although effective for general scene understanding, these short captions often fail to capture complex scenes and convey detailed information. Moreover, captioning models tend to exhibit bias towards the ``average'' caption, which captures only the more general aspects, thus overlooking finer details. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate richer and more informative image captions by combining the captions generated from different SoTA captioning models. Our proposed method requires no additional model training: given an image, it leverages pre-trained models from the literature to generate the initial captions, and then ranks them using a newly introduced image-text-based metric, which we name BLIPScore. Subsequently, the top two captions are fused using a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the final, more detailed description. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30k test sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of caption-image alignment and hallucination reduction according to the ALOHa, CAPTURE, and Polos metrics. A subjective study lends additional support to these results, suggesting that the captions produced by our model are generally perceived as more consistent with human judgment. By combining the strengths of diverse SoTA models, our method enhances the quality and appeal of image captions, bridging the gap between automated systems and the rich and informative nature of human-generated descriptions. This advance enables the generation of more suitable captions for the training of both vision-language and captioning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for publication in Springer Neural Computing and Applications</p></details> |

Previous defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing performance trained on poisoned datasets.</p></details> |  |

As a key component of the transformer model, self-attention calculates the attention values by mapping the relationships among the head elements of the source and target sequence, yet there is no explicit mechanism to refine and intensify the attention values with respect to the context of the input and target sequences. Based on this intuition, we introduce a novel refine and intensify attention mechanism that is called Zoneup Dropout Injection Attention Calculation (ZoDIAC), in which the intensities of attention values in the elements of the input source and target sequences are first refined using GELU and dropout and then intensified using a proposed zoneup process which includes the injection of a learned scalar factor. Our extensive experiments show that ZoDIAC achieves statistically significant higher scores under all image captioning metrics using various feature extractors in comparison to the conventional self-attention module in the transformer model on the MS-COCO dataset. Our proposed ZoDIAC attention modules can be used as a drop-in replacement for the attention components in all transformer models. The code for our experiments is publicly available at: https://github.com/zanyarz/zodiac</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been published in IEEE AIxSET 2024 and is available conference proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models through Aligning Attention Distribution to Information Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14257v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the unidirectional masking mechanism, Decoder-Only models propagate information from left to right. LVLMs (Large Vision-Language Models) follow the same architecture, with visual information gradually integrated into semantic representations during forward propagation. Through systematic analysis, we observe that the majority of the visual information is absorbed into the semantic representations. However, the model's attention distribution does not exhibit sufficient emphasis on semantic representations. This misalignment between the attention distribution and the actual information flow undermines the model's visual understanding ability and contributes to hallucinations. To address this issue, we enhance the model's visual understanding by leveraging the core information embedded in semantic representations. Specifically, we identify attention heads that focus on core semantic representations based on their attention distributions. Then, through a two-stage optimization paradigm, we propagate the advantages of these attention heads across the entire model, aligning the attention distribution with the actual information flow. We evaluate our method on three image captioning benchmarks using five different LVLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly reducing hallucinations. Further experiments reveal a trade-off between reduced hallucinations and richer details. Notably, our method allows for manual adjustment of the model's conservativeness, enabling flexible control to meet diverse real-world requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Many models have been developed to generate these captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet, authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances, these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings.

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have achieved significant advancements, they present limitations. The inherent sequential nature of RNNs leads to sluggish training and inference times. LSTMs further struggle with retaining information from earlier sequence elements when dealing with very long se- quences. This project presents a comprehensive guide to constructing and comprehending transformer models for image captioning. Transformers employ self-attention mechanisms, capturing both short- and long-range dependencies within the data. This facilitates efficient parallelization during both training and inference phases. We leverage the well-established Transformer architecture, recognized for its effectiveness in managing sequential data, and present a meticulous methodology. Utilizing the Flickr30k dataset, we conduct data pre- processing, construct a model architecture that integrates an EfficientNetB0 CNN for fea- ture extraction, and train the model with attention mechanisms incorporated. Our approach exemplifies the utilization of parallelization for efficient training and inference. You can find the project on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLLM-Driven Semantic Identifier Generation for Generative Cross-Modal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17359v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative cross-modal retrieval, which treats retrieval as a generation task, has emerged as a promising direction with the rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In this setting, the model responds to a text query by generating an identifier corresponding to the target image. However, existing methods typically rely on manually crafted string IDs, clustering-based labels, or atomic identifiers requiring vocabulary expansion, all of which face challenges in semantic alignment or scalability.To address these limitations, we propose a vocabulary-efficient identifier generation framework that prompts MLLMs to generate Structured Semantic Identifiers from image-caption pairs. These identifiers are composed of concept-level tokens such as objects and actions, naturally aligning with the model's generation space without modifying the tokenizer. Additionally, we introduce a Rationale-Guided Supervision Strategy, prompting the model to produce a one-sentence explanation alongside each identifier serves as an auxiliary supervision signal that improves semantic grounding and reduces hallucinations during training.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate whether images can act as cultural context in multimodal translation. We introduce CaMMT, a human-curated benchmark of over 5,800 triples of images along with parallel captions in English and regional languages. Using this dataset, we evaluate five Vision Language Models (VLMs) in text-only and text+image settings. Through automatic and human evaluations, we find that visual context generally improves translation quality, especially in handling Culturally-Specific Items (CSIs), disambiguation, and correct gender marking. By releasing CaMMT, our objective is to support broader efforts to build and evaluate multimodal translation systems that are better aligned with cultural nuance and regional variations.</p></details> |  |

VCASFT leverages image captions as zero-shot prompts alongside question-answer pairs and instruction-tunes models to yield significant performance improvements. To comprehensively evaluate VCASFT, we benchmark it on ScienceQA, which consists of questions across diverse languages, subjects, and fields, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness in a variety of educational contexts. Additionally, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique on lowresource languages, we developed HiSciVQA, a dataset comprising 2,245 high-quality, hand-annotated Hindi multimodal Q&A pairs. This dataset addresses the critical need for low-resource language Q&A datasets and serves as a foundation for testing VCASFT. Additionally, we introduce a novel LLM-based evaluation scheme to evaluate VLMs on HiSciVQA which offers deeper insights into model effectiveness surpassing traditional n-gram matching accuracy metrics. We are committed to advancing the field by open-sourcing all code files and the HiSciVQA dataset for the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Describe-to-Score: Text-Guided Efficient Image Complexity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16609v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately assessing image complexity (IC) is critical for computer vision, yet most existing methods rely solely on visual features and often neglect high-level semantic information, limiting their accuracy and generalization. We introduce vision-text fusion for IC modeling. This approach integrates visual and textual semantic features, increasing representational diversity. It also reduces the complexity of the hypothesis space, which enhances both accuracy and generalization in complexity assessment. We propose the D2S (Describe-to-Score) framework, which generates image captions with a pre-trained vision-language model. We propose the feature alignment and entropy distribution alignment mechanisms, D2S guides semantic information to inform complexity assessment while bridging the gap between vision and text modalities. D2S utilizes multi-modal information during training but requires only the vision branch during inference, thereby avoiding multi-modal computational overhead and enabling efficient assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that D2S outperforms existing methods on the IC9600 dataset and maintains competitiveness on no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) benchmark, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-modal fusion in complexity-related tasks.

| **[Advancing Reference-free Evaluation of Video Captions with Factual Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16538v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video captions offer concise snapshots of actors, objects, and actions within a video, serving as valuable assets for applications such as question answering and event localization. However, acquiring human annotations for video captions is costly or even impractical, especially when dealing with diverse video domains. Existing models trained on supervised datasets face challenges in evaluating performance across different domains due to the reliance on reference-based evaluation protocols, which necessitate ground truth captions. This assumption is unrealistic for evaluating videos in the wild. To address these limitations, we propose a reference-free evaluation framework that does not require ground truth captions, focusing on factual grounding to ensure accurate assessment of caption quality. We introduce VC-Inspector, a novel caption quality evaluator that is both reference-free and factually grounded. Utilizing large language models, we generate pseudo captions of varying quality based on supervised data, which are subsequently used to train a multimodal model (i.e., Qwen2.5-VL) as the evaluator. Our approach demonstrates superior alignment with human judgments on the VATEX-Eval dataset, outperforming existing methods. The performance also generalizes to image caption datasets, Flickr8K-Expert and Flickr8K-CF, when viewing images as 1-frame videos. Overall, VC-Inspector offers a scalable and generalizable solution for evaluating the factual accuracy of video captions, paving the way for more effective and objective assessment methodologies in diverse video domains.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ViLU, a new Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations. ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found here: https://github.com/ykrmm/ViLU.</p></details> |  |
| **[RACap: Relation-Aware Prompting for Lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15883v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent retrieval-augmented image captioning methods incorporate external knowledge to compensate for the limitations in comprehending complex scenes. However, current approaches face challenges in relation modeling: (1) the representation of semantic prompts is too coarse-grained to capture fine-grained relationships; (2) these methods lack explicit modeling of image objects and their semantic relationships. To address these limitations, we propose RACap, a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning, which not only mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions, but also identifies heterogeneous objects from the image. RACap effectively retrieves structured relation features that contain heterogeneous visual information to enhance the semantic consistency and relational expressiveness. Experimental results show that RACap, with only 10.8M trainable parameters, achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORIC: Benchmarking Object Recognition in Incongruous Context for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15695v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in image caption, visual question answering, and robotics by integrating visual and textual information. However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous contexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually expected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification and hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling, which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2) CLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are likely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context. Evaluating 18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models, our results reveal significant recognition gaps, underscoring the challenges posed by contextual incongruity. This work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and encourages further research on context-aware object recognition.</p></details> |  |

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-TEXT, a large-scale and high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To construct the SAR-TEXT dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks: image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT: SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 12.97% and 10.0% on the OSdataset_512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves significant improvements over the original CoCa models in terms of BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores. In the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that, as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

A significant portion of key information is embedded in molecular structure figures, complicating large-scale literature searches and limiting the application of large language models in fields such as biology, chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. The automatic extraction of precise chemical structures is of critical importance. However, the presence of numerous Markush structures in real-world documents, along with variations in molecular image quality, drawing styles, and noise, significantly limits the performance of existing optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) methods. We present MolParser, a novel end-to-end OCSR method that efficiently and accurately recognizes chemical structures from real-world documents, including difficult Markush structure. We use a extended SMILES encoding rule to annotate our training dataset. Under this rule, we build MolParser-7M, the largest annotated molecular image dataset to our knowledge. While utilizing a large amount of synthetic data, we employed active learning methods to incorporate substantial in-the-wild data, specifically samples cropped from real patents and scientific literature, into the training process. We trained an end-to-end molecular image captioning model, MolParser, using a curriculum learning approach. MolParser significantly outperforms classical and learning-based methods across most scenarios, with potential for broader downstream applications. The dataset is publicly available in huggingface.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Multimodal Dataset Distillation via Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15472v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset, enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation. Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Hierarchy of Nondeterminism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09866v6)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study three levels in a hierarchy of nondeterminism: A nondeterministic automaton $\mathcal{A}$ is determinizable by pruning (DBP) if we can obtain a deterministic automaton equivalent to $\mathcal{A}$ by removing some of its transitions. Then, $\mathcal{A}$ is history deterministic (HD) if its nondeterministic choices can be resolved in a way that only depends on the past. Finally, $\mathcal{A}$ is semantically deterministic (SD) if different nondeterministic choices in $\mathcal{A}$ lead to equivalent states. Some applications of automata in formal methods require deterministic automata, yet in fact can use automata with some level of nondeterminism. For example, DBP automata are useful in the analysis of online algorithms, and HD automata are useful in synthesis and control. For automata on finite words, the three levels in the hierarchy coincide. We study the hierarchy for B\"uchi, co-B\"uchi, and weak automata on infinite words. We show that the hierarchy is strict, study the expressive power of the different levels in it, as well as the complexity of deciding the membership of a language in a given level. Finally, we describe a probability-based analysis of the hierarchy, which relates the level of nondeterminism with the probability that a random run on a word in the language is accepting. We relate the latter to nondeterministic automata that can be used when reasoning about probabilistic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 6 figures, added a section about MDPs and GFM automata</p></details> |

In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate candidate molecules' functional responses against disease targets. Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of assays offer rich information for drug discovery campaigns but has been untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.</p></details> | 26 pages, 10 figures |

Most compilers leverage the capabilities of digital and analog quantum computers by representing quantum particle systems with Pauli strings or digital quantum circuits, making it challenging for users in physics, chemistry, and biology to program simulations effectively. QBLUE is proposed as the first programming language for describing the behaviors of quantum systems in terms of second quantization Hamiltonians. Within QBLUE, a novel type system is proposed to clearly define states across different quantum systems and treat quantum computers as quantum particle systems of specific types. The type system is compatible with the compilation of quantum simulations expressed in QBLUE for digital and analog quantum computers. With QBLUE, users can specify the desired quantum particle system and model the system on quantum computers.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted talk paper in the 22nd International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2025)</p></details> |
| **[CLIP Can Understand Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03251v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that CLIP can also be adapted to downstream tasks where its vision-language alignment is suboptimally learned during pre-training on web-crawled data, all without requiring fine-tuning. We explore the case of monocular depth estimation, where CLIP's contrastive prior struggles to generalize, compared to its success in domains such as generative modeling and semantic segmentation. Since CLIP fails to consistently capture similarities between image patches and natural language prompts describing distance, we eliminate the use of its pre-trained natural language token embeddings and distill the semantic prior of its frozen text encoder into a single learnable embedding matrix called "mirror". The main design goal of mirror is to derive a non-human language prompt that approximates an optimal natural language prompt: "How far is this location from the camera?" Using this approach, we jointly train two lightweight modules, a mirror and a compact decoder, on top of a frozen CLIP for dense depth prediction. Compared to conventional depth models, our framework is significantly more efficient in terms of parameters and computation. The resulting model exhibits impressive performance, matching several state-of-the-art vision models on the NYU Depth v2 and KITTI benchmark datasets, while outperforming all vision-language depth models based on a frozen CLIP prior. Experiments demonstrate that the suboptimal depth understanding of CLIP in terms of spatial and temporal consistency can be significantly corrected without either fine-tuning it or concatenating mirror with its pre-trained subword token embeddings. Furthermore, an ablation study on the convergence status of mirror shows that it is implicitly trained to capture objects, such as humans and windows, where semantic cues play an important role in detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Pattern Recognition, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Multi-agent Path Finding in Continuous Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16410v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time Conflict Based-Search (CCBS) has long been viewed as the standard optimal baseline for multi-agent path finding in continuous time (MAPFR), yet recent critiques show that the theoretically described CCBS can fail to terminate on solvable MAPFR problems while the publicly available reference implementation can return sub-optimal solutions. This work presents an analytical framework that yields simple and sufficient conditions under which any CCBS-style algorithm is both sound and solution complete. Investigating the reference CCBS implementation reveals that it violates our sufficient conditions for soundness, with counterexamples demonstrating sub-optimality. Leveraging the framework, we introduce a branching rule ($\delta$-BR) and prove it restores soundness and termination guarantees. Consequently, the resulting CCBS variant is both sound and solution complete. To our knowledge, this is the first MAPFR solver matching the guarantees of the discrete-time CBS. On a constructed example, CCBS with $\delta$-BR improves sum-of-costs from 10.707 to 9.000 ($\approx$ 16% lower) compared to the reference CCBS implementation. Across benchmarks, the reference CCBS implementation is generally able to find solutions faster than CCBS with $\delta$-BR due to its more aggressive pruning. However, this comes at the cost of occasional sub-optimality and potential non-termination when all solutions are pruned, whereas $\delta$-BR preserves optimality and guarantees termination by design. Because $\delta$-BR largely only affects the branching step, it can be adopted as a drop-in replacement in existing codebases. Beyond CCBS, the analytical framework and termination criterion provide a systematic way to evaluate other CCBS-like MAPFR solvers and future extensions, thereby offering tools for rigorous analysis of next-generation MAPFR algorithms.</p></details> | 35 pages |

Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts, hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and practicality across various dynamic scenarios.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

Current radar imaging methods, however, rely on synthetic aperture or multi-frame aggregation to improve resolution, which is impractical for small aerial, inspection, or wearable systems. We present RadarSFD, a conditional latent diffusion framework that reconstructs dense LiDAR-like point clouds from a single radar frame without motion or SAR. Our approach transfers geometric priors from a pretrained monocular depth estimator into the diffusion backbone, anchors them to radar inputs via channel-wise latent concatenation, and regularizes outputs with a dual-space objective combining latent and pixel-space losses. On the RadarHD benchmark, RadarSFD achieves 35 cm Chamfer Distance and 28 cm Modified Hausdorff Distance, improving over the single-frame RadarHD baseline (56 cm, 45 cm) and remaining competitive with multi-frame methods using 5-41 frames. Qualitative results show recovery of fine walls and narrow gaps, and experiments across new environments confirm strong generalization. Ablation studies highlight the importance of pretrained initialization, radar BEV conditioning, and the dual-space loss. Together, these results establish the first practical single-frame, no-SAR mmWave radar pipeline for dense point cloud perception in compact robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel approach to generating synthetic tabular data based on the principle of maximum entropy -- MaxEnt -- called GEM-T, for ``generative entropy maximization for tables.'' GEM-T directly captures nth-order interactions -- pairwise, third-order, etc. -- among columns of training data. In extensive testing, GEM-T matches or exceeds deep neural network approaches previously regarded as state-of-the-art in 23 of 34 publicly available datasets representing diverse subject domains (68\%). Notably, GEM-T involves orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable parameters, demonstrating that much of the information in real-world data resides in low-dimensional, potentially human-interpretable correlations, provided that the input data is appropriately transformed first. Furthermore, MaxEnt better handles heterogeneous data types (continuous vs. discrete vs. categorical), lack of local structure, and other features of tabular data. GEM-T represents a promising direction for light-weight high-performance generative models for structured data.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

Conventional manual microscopy methods suffer from time inefficiency and diagnostic inaccuracies. Existing automated detection approaches remain constrained by high deployment costs and suboptimal accuracy. While deep learning has introduced powerful paradigms to this field, persistent challenges in detecting overlapping cells and multi-scale objects hinder practical deployment. This study proposes the multi-scale YOLO (MS-YOLO), a blood cell detection model based on the YOLOv11 framework, incorporating three key architectural innovations to enhance detection performance. Specifically, the multi-scale dilated residual module (MS-DRM) replaces the original C3K2 modules to improve multi-scale discriminability; the dynamic cross-path feature enhancement module (DCFEM) enables the fusion of hierarchical features from the backbone with aggregated features from the neck to enhance feature representations; and the light adaptive-weight downsampling module (LADS) improves feature downsampling through adaptive spatial weighting while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the CBC benchmark demonstrate that MS-YOLO achieves precise detection of overlapping cells and multi-scale objects, particularly small targets such as platelets, achieving an mAP@50 of 97.4% that outperforms existing models. Further validation on the supplementary WBCDD dataset confirms its robust generalization capability. Additionally, with a lightweight architecture and real-time inference efficiency, MS-YOLO meets clinical deployment requirements, providing reliable technical support for standardized blood pathology assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There is a disagreement among the authors regarding the content and submission of the manuscript, which needs to be resolved before it can be made public</p></details> |

Addressing these challenges requires detection methods offering both function-level precision to minimize breakage and inherent robustness against code obfuscation and URL manipulation. We introduce ByteDefender, the first system leveraging V8 engine bytecode to detect fingerprinting operations specifically at the JavaScript function level. A Transformer-based classifier, trained offline on bytecode sequences, accurately identifies functions exhibiting fingerprinting behavior. We develop and evaluate light-weight signatures derived from this model to enable low-overhead, on-device matching against function bytecode during compilation but prior to execution, which only adds a 4% (average) latency to the page load time. This mechanism facilitates targeted, real-time prevention of fingerprinting function execution, thereby preserving legitimate script functionality. Operating directly on bytecode ensures inherent resilience against common code obfuscation and URL-based evasion. Our evaluation on the top 100k websites demonstrates high detection accuracy at both function- and script-level, with substantial improvements over state-of-the-art AST-based methods, particularly in robustness against obfuscation. ByteDefender offers a practical framework for effective, precise, and robust fingerprinting mitigation.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a complete UAV-oriented solution that combines both dataset construction and model innovation. First, we design a refined UAV-Label Engine, which efficiently resolves annotation redundancy, inconsistency, and ambiguity, enabling the generation of largescale UAV datasets. Based on this engine, we construct two new benchmarks: UAVDE-2M, with over 2.4M instances across 1,800+ categories, and UAVCAP-15K, providing rich image-text pairs for vision-language pretraining. Second, we introduce the Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement (CAGE) module, a lightweight dual-path fusion design that integrates cross-attention, adaptive gating, and global FiLM modulation for robust textvision alignment. By embedding CAGE into the YOLO-World-v2 framework, our method achieves significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency, notably improving zero-shot detection on VisDrone by +5.3 mAP while reducing parameters and GFLOPs, and demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization on SIMD. Extensive experiments and real-world UAV deployment confirm the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed solution for UAV-based OVD</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI, BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy and efficiency, while class-weighted losses enhance recall for rare VRUs. Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and RGB-to-thermal augmentation boosts recall, demonstrating the potential of multimodal detection to improve VRU safety at intersections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Light-Weight Object Recognition for Real-Time Document Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06246v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions: improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model. Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system. The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while retaining a competitive OCR quality metric.

However, high-dimensional embeddings present significant challenges in terms of storage resource and inference speed. Unlike traditional KG embedding methods, FKGE involves multiple client-server communication rounds, where communication efficiency is critical. Existing embedding compression methods for traditional KGs may not be directly applicable to FKGE as they often require multiple model trainings which potentially incur substantial communication costs. In this paper, we propose a light-weight component based on Knowledge Distillation (KD) which is titled FedKD and tailored specifically for FKGE methods. During client-side local training, FedKD facilitates the low-dimensional student model to mimic the score distribution of triples from the high-dimensional teacher model using KL divergence loss. Unlike traditional KD way, FedKD adaptively learns a temperature to scale the score of positive triples and separately adjusts the scores of corresponding negative triples using a predefined temperature, thereby mitigating teacher over-confidence issue. Furthermore, we dynamically adjust the weight of KD loss to optimize the training process. Extensive experiments on three datasets support the effectiveness of FedKD.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPU Acceleration of SQL Analytics on Compressed Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10092v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPUs are uniquely suited to accelerate (SQL) analytics workloads thanks to their massive compute parallelism and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) -- when datasets fit in the GPU HBM, performance is unparalleled. Unfortunately, GPU HBMs remain typically small when compared with lower-bandwidth CPU main memory. Besides brute-force scaling across many GPUs, current solutions to accelerate queries on large datasets include leveraging data partitioning and loading smaller data batches in GPU HBM, and hybrid execution with a connected device (e.g., CPUs). Unfortunately, these approaches are exposed to the limitations of lower main memory and host-to-device interconnect bandwidths, introduce additional I/O overheads, or incur higher costs. This is a substantial problem when trying to scale adoption of GPUs on larger datasets. Data compression can alleviate this bottleneck, but to avoid paying for costly decompression/decoding, an ideal solution must include computation primitives to operate directly on data in compressed form. This is the focus of our paper: a set of new methods for running queries directly on light-weight compressed data using schemes such as Run-Length Encoding (RLE), index encoding, bit-width reductions, and dictionary encoding. Our novelty includes operating on multiple RLE columns without decompression, handling heterogeneous column encodings, and leveraging PyTorch tensor operations for portability across devices. Experimental evaluations show speedups of an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art commercial CPU-only analytics systems, for real-world queries on a production dataset that would not fit into GPU memory uncompressed. This work paves the road for GPU adoption in a much broader set of use cases, and it is complementary to most other scale-out or fallback mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration, resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner, allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE). Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task, called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in fidelity and consistency.</p></details> |  |

We propose an online-trained neural cache that stores visibility between lights and 3D positions. We feed light visibility to weighted reservoir sampling (WRS) to sample a light source. The cache is implemented as a fully-fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multi-resolution hash-grid encoding, enabling online training and efficient inference on modern GPUs in real-time frame rates. The cache can be seamlessly integrated into existing rendering frameworks and can be used in combination with other real-time techniques such as spatiotemporal reservoir sampling (ReSTIR).</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt design that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user tasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and the high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to tremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly undermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied. This paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i) provides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii) enhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based fine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is proposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs, bridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the RSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by the LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until being verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the LLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications. Experiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range of LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Pre-trained models (PTMs) show promising capabilities in CIL. However, existing approaches that apply lightweight fine-tuning to backbones still induce parameter drift, thereby compromising the generalization capability of pre-trained models. Parameter drift can be conceptualized as a form of noise that obscures critical patterns learned for previous tasks. However, recent researches have shown that noise is not always harmful. For example, the large number of visual patterns learned from pre-training can be easily abused by a single task, and introducing appropriate noise can suppress some low-correlation features, thus leaving a margin for future tasks. To this end, we propose learning beneficial noise for CIL guided by information theory and propose Mixture of Noise (Min), aiming to mitigate the degradation of backbone generalization from adapting new tasks. Specifically, task-specific noise is learned from high-dimension features of new tasks. Then, a set of weights is adjusted dynamically for optimal mixture of different task noise. Finally, Min embeds the beneficial noise into the intermediate features to mask the response of inefficient patterns. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that Min achieves state-of-the-art performance in most incremental settings, with particularly outstanding results in 50-steps incremental settings. This shows the significant potential for beneficial noise in continual learning.

Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and class-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and overfitting. However, new-class prototypes suffer significant estimation bias due to extreme data scarcity, whereas base-class prototypes benefit from sufficient data. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that aligning the new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis reduces variance and improves prototype accuracy. Furthermore, we propose large-scale contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. To further enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes, we integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the Momentum Tightness and Contrast framework (MoTiC), constructing a feature space with rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion. Experiments on three FSCIL benchmarks produce state-of-the-art performances, particularly on the fine-grained task CUB-200, validating our method's ability to reduce estimation bias and improve incremental learning robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class-wise Balancing Data Replay for Federated Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07712v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS'25 Accepted, Oral</p></details> |

This work focuses on the Coarse-To-Fine Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) task. Our study follows the Knowe approach, which contrastively learns coarse class labels and subsequently normalizes and freezes the classifier weights of learned fine classes in the embedding space. To better interpret the "coarse-to-fine" paradigm, we propose embedding the feature extractor into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ the Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space, enabling the feature extractor to transform input images into feature vectors within the Poincar\'e ball instead of Euclidean space. We further introduce hyperbolic contrastive loss and hyperbolic fully-connected layers to facilitate model optimization and classification in hyperbolic space. Additionally, to enhance performance under few-shot conditions, we implement maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic space to estimate the probability distribution of fine-class feature vectors. This allows generation of augmented features from the distribution to mitigate overfitting during training with limited samples. Experiments on C2FSCIL benchmarks show that our method effectively improves both coarse and fine class accuracies.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3D class-incremental learning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric misalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with 2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by texture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural cues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a framework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical spatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric Rectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's intermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion. Additionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal consistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.</p></details> | ICCV2025 |
| **[AFT: An Exemplar-Free Class Incremental Learning Method for Environmental Sound Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15523v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As sounds carry rich information, environmental sound classification (ESC) is crucial for numerous applications such as rare wild animals detection. However, our world constantly changes, asking ESC models to adapt to new sounds periodically. The major challenge here is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose the ability to recognize old sounds when learning new ones. Many methods address this using replay-based continual learning. This could be impractical in scenarios such as data privacy concerns. Exemplar-free methods are commonly used but can distort old features, leading to worse performance. To overcome such limitations, we propose an Acoustic Feature Transformation (AFT) technique that aligns the temporal features of old classes to the new space, including a selectively compressed feature space. AFT mitigates the forgetting of old knowledge without retaining past data. We conducted experiments on two datasets, showing consistent improvements over baseline models with accuracy gains of 3.7\% to 3.9\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Unbiased Online Curvature Approximation for Regularized Graph Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12727v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free, class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes. In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix (FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability (retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Efficient Single-Step Framework for Incremental Class Learning in Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11285v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incremental learning remains a critical challenge in machine learning, as models often struggle with catastrophic forgetting -the tendency to lose previously acquired knowledge when learning new information. These challenges are even more pronounced in resource-limited settings. Many existing Class Incremental Learning (CIL) methods achieve high accuracy by continually adapting their feature representations; however, they often require substantial computational resources and complex, iterative training procedures. This work introduces CIFNet (Class Incremental and Frugal Network), a novel CIL approach that addresses these limitations by offering a highly efficient and sustainable solution. CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several existing, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature extractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer neural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor eliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone. This, combined with a compressed buffer for efficient memory use, enables CIFNet to perform efficient class-incremental learning through a single-step optimization process on fixed features, minimizing computational overhead and training time without requiring multiple weight updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that CIFNet effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting at the classifier level, achieving high accuracy comparable to that of existing state-of-the-art methods, while substantially improving training efficiency and sustainability. CIFNet represents a significant advancement in making class-incremental learning more accessible and pragmatic in environments with limited resources, especially when strong pre-trained feature extractors are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Domain Attribute Alignment with CLIP: A Rehearsal-Free Approach for Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11264v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task. Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

| **[Uncertainty-Driven Hierarchical Sampling for Unbalanced Continual Malware Detection with Time-Series Update-Based Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07532v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android malware detection continues to face persistent challenges stemming from long-term concept drift and class imbalance, as evolving malicious behaviors and shifting usage patterns dynamically reshape feature distributions. Although continual learning (CL) mitigates drift, existing replay-based methods suffer from inherent bias. Specifically, their reliance on classifier uncertainty for sample selection disproportionately prioritizes the dominant benign class, causing overfitting and reduced generalization to evolving malware. To address these limitations, we propose a novel uncertainty-guided CL framework. First, we introduce a hierarchical balanced sampler that employs a dual-phase uncertainty strategy to dynamically balance benign and malicious samples while simultaneously selecting high-information, high-uncertainty instances within each class. This mechanism ensures class equilibrium across both replay and incremental data, thereby enhancing adaptability to emerging threats. Second, we augment the framework with a vector retrieval mechanism that exploits historical malware embeddings to identify evolved variants via similarity-based retrieval, thereby complementing classifier updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under strict low-label conditions (50 labels per phase). It achieves a true positive rate (TPR) of 92.95\% and a mean accuracy (mACC) of 94.26\%, which validates its efficacy for sustainable Android malware detection.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2025)</p></details> |

Soft-TF sequentially learns and selects an optimal soft-network for each task. During sequential training in CL, a well-initialized Soft-TF mask optimizes the weights of sparse layers to obtain task-adaptive soft (real-valued) networks, while keeping the well-pre-trained layer parameters frozen. In inference, the identified task-adaptive network of Soft-TF masks the parameters of the pre-trained network, mapping to an optimal solution for each task and minimizing Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) - the soft-masking preserves the knowledge of the pre-trained network. Extensive experiments on the Vision Transformer (ViT) and the Language Transformer (Bert) demonstrate the effectiveness of Soft-TF, achieving state-of-the-art performance across Vision and Language Class Incremental Learning (CIL) scenarios.</p></details> |  |

By abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process, and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework (LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates, while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in multi-step scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes. However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels (ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD) methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure its computational complexity to validate its suitability for resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by more than 5% in final accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[Class Incremental Continual Learning with Self-Organizing Maps and Variational Autoencoders Using Synthetic Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21240v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual learning.</p></details> |  |

Recently, replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this, exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge representations. To this end, we propose to fuse information from sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr$^2$R). More specifically, by distilling the training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the fused samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving data privacy. Specifically, Pr$^2$R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other replay-based methods, respectively.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Inspired by memory consolidation in the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space, potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.</p></details> |  |
