Mechanistic models provide a principled framework to disentangle these sources and extract insight, but inferring underlying dynamics from standard sequencing count data faces fundamental limitations. Structured datasets with temporal, spatial, or multimodal features offer constraints that help resolve these ambiguities, but demand more complex models and advanced inference strategies, including machine learning techniques with associated tradeoffs. This review highlights recent progress in the judicious integration of structured single-cell data, stochastic model development, and innovative inference strategies to extract gene-level insights. These approaches lay the foundation for mechanistic understanding of regulatory networks and multicellular systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Grokking a Computational Glass Relaxation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11411v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Covering Multiple Objectives with a Small Set of Solutions Using Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19342v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-objective black-box optimization, the goal is typically to find solutions that optimize a set of $T$ black-box objective functions, $f_1$, ..., $f_T$, simultaneously. Traditional approaches often seek a single Pareto-optimal set that balances trade-offs among all objectives. In this work, we consider a problem setting that departs from this paradigm: finding a small set of K < T solutions, that collectively "covers" the T objectives. A set of solutions is defined as "covering" if, for each objective $f_1$, ..., $f_T$, there is at least one good solution. A motivating example for this problem setting occurs in drug design. For example, we may have T pathogens and aim to identify a set of K < T antibiotics such that at least one antibiotic can be used to treat each pathogen. To address this problem, we propose Multi-Objective Coverage Bayesian Optimization (MOCOBO), a principled algorithm designed to efficiently find a covering set. We validate our approach through experiments on challenging high-dimensional tasks, including applications in peptide and molecular design, where MOCOBO is shown to find high-performing covering sets of solutions. The results show that the coverage of the K < T solutions found by MOCOBO matches or nearly matches the coverage of T solutions obtained by optimizing each objective individually. Furthermore, in in vitro experiments, the peptides found by MOCOBO exhibited high potency against drug-resistant pathogens, further demonstrating the potential of MOCOBO for drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

However, they have suffered from two critical limitations. (1) Although most applications require on-the-move communication and sensing, prior conformal arrays have suffered from dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. We introduce a Dynamic Beam-Stabilized (DBS) processor capable of beam adaptation through on-chip real-time control of fundamental gain, phase, and delay for each element. (2) Prior conformal arrays have leveraged additive printing to enhance flexibility, but conventional printable inks based on silver are expensive, and those based on copper suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. We instead leverage a low-cost Copper Molecular Decomposition (CuMOD) ink with < 0.1% variation per degree C with temperature and strain and correct any residual deformity in real-time using the DBS processor. Demonstrating unified material and physical deformation correction, our CMOS DBS processor is low power, low-area, and easily scalable due to a tile architecture, thereby ideal for on-device implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Uploa...</summary><p>Uploaded by mistake, this is second version of the previous upload real-time deformation correction paper (arXiv:2406.07797).

Typically trained bottom-up, atomistic NN potential models can reach first-principle accuracy, while coarse-grained implicit solvent NN potentials surpass classical continuum solvent models. However, overcoming the limitations of costly generation of accurate reference data and data inefficiency of common bottom-up training demands efficient incorporation of data from many sources. This paper introduces the framework chemtrain to learn sophisticated NN potential models through customizable training routines and advanced training algorithms. These routines can combine multiple top-down and bottom-up algorithms, e.g., to incorporate both experimental and simulation data or pre-train potentials with less costly algorithms. chemtrain provides an object-oriented high-level interface to simplify the creation of custom routines. On the lower level, chemtrain relies on JAX to compute gradients and scale the computations to use available resources. We demonstrate the simplicity and importance of combining multiple algorithms in the examples of parametrizing an all-atomistic model of titanium and a coarse-grained implicit solvent model of alanine dipeptide.</p></details> | <details><summary>Packa...</summary><p>Package source code published at http://github.com/tummfm/chemtrain</p></details> |
| **[VitaGraph: Building a Knowledge Graph for Biologically Relevant Learning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11185v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intrinsic complexity of human biology presents ongoing challenges to scientific understanding. Researchers collaborate across disciplines to expand our knowledge of the biological interactions that define human life. AI methodologies have emerged as powerful tools across scientific domains, particularly in computational biology, where graph data structures effectively model biological entities such as protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and gene functional networks. Those networks are used as datasets for paramount network medicine tasks, such as gene-disease association prediction, drug repurposing, and polypharmacy side effect studies. Reliable predictions from machine learning models require high-quality foundational data. In this work, we present a comprehensive multi-purpose biological knowledge graph constructed by integrating and refining multiple publicly available datasets. Building upon the Drug Repurposing Knowledge Graph (DRKG), we define a pipeline tasked with a) cleaning inconsistencies and redundancies present in DRKG, b) coalescing information from the main available public data sources, and c) enriching the graph nodes with expressive feature vectors such as molecular fingerprints and gene ontologies. Biologically and chemically relevant features improve the capacity of machine learning models to generate accurate and well-structured embedding spaces. The resulting resource represents a coherent and reliable biological knowledge graph that serves as a state-of-the-art platform to advance research in computational biology and precision medicine. Moreover, it offers the opportunity to benchmark graph-based machine learning and network medicine models on relevant tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset by benchmarking it against the task of drug repurposing, PPI prediction, and side-effect prediction, modeled as link prediction problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages of main text, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Learning Equivariant Non-Local Electron Density Functionals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07972v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accuracy of density functional theory hinges on the approximation of non-local contributions to the exchange-correlation (XC) functional. To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). Where previous works relied on semi-local functionals or fixed-size descriptors of the density, we compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud for efficient non-local atomic-range interactions. By applying an equivariant GNN on this point cloud, we capture molecular-range interactions in a scalable and accurate manner. To train EG-XC, we differentiate through a self-consistent field solver requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Representation Learning, 2025</p></details> |
| **[MetaSym: A Symplectic Meta-learning Framework for Physical Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16667v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scalable and generalizable physics-aware deep learning has long been considered a significant challenge with various applications across diverse domains ranging from robotics to molecular dynamics. Central to almost all physical systems are symplectic forms, the geometric backbone that underpins fundamental invariants like energy and momentum. In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, MetaSym. In particular, MetaSym combines a strong symplectic inductive bias obtained from a symplectic encoder, and an autoregressive decoder with meta-attention. This principled design ensures that core physical invariants remain intact, while allowing flexible, data-efficient adaptation to system heterogeneities. We benchmark MetaSym with highly varied and realistic datasets, such as a high-dimensional spring-mesh system (Otness et al., 2021), an open quantum system with dissipation and measurement backaction, and robotics-inspired quadrotor dynamics. Our results demonstrate superior performance in modeling dynamics under few-shot adaptation, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines that use larger models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 + ...</summary><p>10 + 11 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

| **[Evolutionary training-free guidance in diffusion model for 3D multi-objective molecular generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11037v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering novel 3D molecular structures that simultaneously satisfy multiple property targets remains a central challenge in materials and drug design. Although recent diffusion-based models can generate 3D conformations, they require expensive retraining for each new property or property-combination and lack flexibility in enforcing structural constraints. We introduce EGD (Evolutionary Guidance in Diffusion), a training-free framework that embeds evolutionary operators directly into the diffusion sampling process. By performing crossover on noise-perturbed samples and then denoising them with a pretrained Unconditional diffusion model, EGD seamlessly blends structural fragments and steers generation toward user-specified objectives without any additional model updates. On both single- and multi-target 3D conditional generation tasks-and on multi-objective optimization of quantum properties EGD outperforms state-of-the-art conditional diffusion methods in accuracy and runs up to five times faster per generation. In the single-objective optimization of protein ligands, EGD enables customized ligand generation. Moreover, EGD can embed arbitrary 3D fragments into the generated molecules while optimizing multiple conflicting properties in one unified process. This combination of efficiency, flexibility, and controllable structure makes EGD a powerful tool for rapid, guided exploration of chemical space.</p></details> | Submit to NIPS2025 |

Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in task transfer, they often struggle to accurately analyze molecular features due to limited knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this issue, we present Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules and exhibits explainability and reasoning ability. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental molecular features, taking into account the essential abilities for molecular reasoning. Further, to improve molecular understanding, we propose a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and providing informative responses, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.

| **[GEOM-Drugs Revisited: Toward More Chemically Accurate Benchmarks for 3D Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00169v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models have shown significant promise in generating valid 3D molecular structures, with the GEOM-Drugs dataset serving as a key benchmark. However, current evaluation protocols suffer from critical flaws, including incorrect valency definitions, bugs in bond order calculations, and reliance on force fields inconsistent with the reference data. In this work, we revisit GEOM-Drugs and propose a corrected evaluation framework: we identify and fix issues in data preprocessing, construct chemically accurate valency tables, and introduce a GFN2-xTB-based geometry and energy benchmark. We retrain and re-evaluate several leading models under this framework, providing updated performance metrics and practical recommendations for future benchmarking. Our results underscore the need for chemically rigorous evaluation practices in 3D molecular generation.

| **[Pharmacophore-Conditioned Diffusion Model for Ligand-Based De Novo Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10545v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing bioactive molecules remains a central, time- and cost-heavy challenge in drug discovery, particularly for novel targets lacking structural or functional data. Pharmacophore modeling presents an alternative for capturing the key features required for molecular bioactivity against a biological target. In this work, we present PharmaDiff, a pharmacophore-conditioned diffusion model for 3D molecular generation. PharmaDiff employs a transformer-based architecture to integrate an atom-based representation of the 3D pharmacophore into the generative process, enabling the precise generation of 3D molecular graphs that align with predefined pharmacophore hypotheses. Through comprehensive testing, PharmaDiff demonstrates superior performance in matching 3D pharmacophore constraints compared to ligand-based drug design methods. Additionally, it achieves higher docking scores across a range of proteins in structure-based drug design, without the need for target protein structures. By integrating pharmacophore modeling with 3D generative techniques, PharmaDiff offers a powerful and flexible framework for rational drug design.</p></details> |  |
| **[All You Need Is Synthetic Task Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10120v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Injecting rule-based models like Random Forests into differentiable neural network frameworks remains an open challenge in machine learning. Recent advancements have demonstrated that pretrained models can generate efficient molecular embeddings. However, these approaches often require extensive pretraining and additional techniques, such as incorporating posterior probabilities, to boost performance. In our study, we propose a novel strategy that jointly trains a single Graph Transformer neural network on both sparse multitask molecular property experimental targets and synthetic targets derived from XGBoost models trained on Osmordred molecular descriptors. These synthetic tasks serve as independent auxiliary tasks. Our results show consistent and significant performance improvement across all 19 molecular property prediction tasks. For 16 out of 19 targets, the multitask Graph Transformer outperforms the XGBoost single-task learner. This demonstrates that synthetic task augmentation is an effective method for enhancing neural model performance in multitask molecular property prediction without the need for feature injection or pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 Figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Fragment-Masked Diffusion for Molecular Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09106v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, aimed at refining molecular structures to enhance drug efficacy and minimize side effects, ultimately accelerating the overall drug development process. Many molecular optimization methods have been proposed, significantly advancing drug discovery. These methods primarily on understanding the specific drug target structures or their hypothesized roles in combating diseases. However, challenges such as a limited number of available targets and a difficulty capturing clear structures hinder innovative drug development. In contrast, phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) does not depend on clear target structures and can identify hits with novel and unbiased polypharmacology signatures. As a result, PDD-based molecular optimization can reduce potential safety risks while optimizing phenotypic activity, thereby increasing the likelihood of clinical success. Therefore, we propose a fragment-masked molecular optimization method based on PDD (FMOP). FMOP employs a regression-free diffusion model to conditionally optimize the molecular masked regions, effectively generating new molecules with similar scaffolds. On the large-scale drug response dataset GDSCv2, we optimize the potential molecules across all 985 cell lines. The overall experiments demonstrate that the in-silico optimization success rate reaches 95.4\%, with an average efficacy increase of 7.5\%. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation and visualization experiments, confirming that FMOP is an effective and robust molecular optimization method. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FMOP-98C2.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Considerations in the use of ML interaction potentials for free energy calculations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13952v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) promise to accurately describe the potential energy surface of molecules at the ab initio level of theory with improved computational efficiency. Within MLFFs, equivariant graph neural networks (EQNNs) have shown great promise in accuracy and performance and are the focus of this work. The capability of EQNNs to recover free energy surfaces (FES) remains to be thoroughly investigated. In this work, we investigate the impact of collective variables (CVs) distribution within the training data on the accuracy of EQNNs predicting the FES of butane and alanine dipeptide (ADP). A generalizable workflow is presented in which training configurations are generated with classical molecular dynamics simulations, and energies and forces are obtained with ab initio calculations. We evaluate how bond and angle constraints in the training data influence the accuracy of EQNN force fields in reproducing the FES of the molecules at both classical and ab initio levels of theory. Results indicate that the model's accuracy is unaffected by the distribution of sampled CVs during training, given that the training data includes configurations from characteristic regions of the system's FES. However, when the training data is obtained from classical simulations, the EQNN struggles to extrapolate the free energy for configurations with high free energy. In contrast, models trained with the same configurations on ab initio data show improved extrapolation accuracy. The findings underscore the difficulties in creating a comprehensive training dataset for EQNNs to predict FESs and highlight the importance of prior knowledge of the system's FES.</p></details> |  |
| **[EDBench: Large-Scale Electron Density Data for Molecular Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09262v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing molecular machine learning force fields (MLFFs) generally focus on the learning of atoms, molecules, and simple quantum chemical properties (such as energy and force), but ignore the importance of electron density (ED) $\rho(r)$ in accurately understanding molecular force fields (MFFs). ED describes the probability of finding electrons at specific locations around atoms or molecules, which uniquely determines all ground state properties (such as energy, molecular structure, etc.) of interactive multi-particle systems according to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, the calculation of ED relies on the time-consuming first-principles density functional theory (DFT) which leads to the lack of large-scale ED data and limits its application in MLFFs. In this paper, we introduce EDBench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ED designed to advance learning-based research at the electronic scale. Built upon the PCQM4Mv2, EDBench provides accurate ED data, covering 3.3 million molecules. To comprehensively evaluate the ability of models to understand and utilize electronic information, we design a suite of ED-centric benchmark tasks spanning prediction, retrieval, and generation. Our evaluation on several state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that learning from EDBench is not only feasible but also achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we show that learning-based method can efficiently calculate ED with comparable precision while significantly reducing the computational cost relative to traditional DFT calculations. All data and benchmarks from EDBench will be freely available, laying a robust foundation for ED-driven drug discovery and materials science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Molecular Design with Steerable and Granular Synthesizability Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08774v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizability in small molecule generative design remains a bottleneck. Existing works that do consider synthesizability can output predicted synthesis routes for generated molecules. However, there has been minimal attention in addressing the ease of synthesis and enabling flexibility to incorporate desired reaction constraints. In this work, we propose a small molecule generative design framework that enables steerable and granular synthesizability control. Generated molecules satisfy arbitrary multi-parameter optimization objectives with predicted synthesis routes containing pre-defined allowed reactions, while optionally avoiding others. One can also enforce that all reactions belong to a pre-defined set. We show the capability to mix-and-match these reaction constraints across the most common medicinal chemistry transformations. Next, we show how our framework can be used to valorize industrial byproducts towards de novo optimized molecules. Going further, we demonstrate how granular control over synthesizability constraints can loosely mimic virtual screening of ultra-large make-on-demand libraries. Using only a single GPU, we generate and dock 15k molecules to identify promising candidates in Freedom 4.0 constituting 142B make-on-demand molecules (assessing only 0.00001% of the library). Generated molecules satisfying the reaction constraints have > 90% exact match rate. Lastly, we benchmark our framework against recent synthesizability-constrained generative models and demonstrate the highest sample efficiency even when imposing the additional constraint that all molecules must be synthesizable from a single reaction type. The main theme is demonstrating that a pre-trained generalist molecular generative model can be incentivized to generate property-optimized small molecules under challenging synthesizability constraints through reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose MetaMolGen, a first-order meta-learning-based molecular generator designed for few-shot and property-conditioned molecular generation. MetaMolGen standardizes the distribution of graph motifs by mapping them to a normalized latent space, and employs a lightweight autoregressive sequence model to generate SMILES sequences that faithfully reflect the underlying molecular structure. In addition, it supports conditional generation of molecules with target properties through a learnable property projector integrated into the generative process.Experimental results demonstrate that MetaMolGen consistently generates valid and diverse SMILES sequences under low-data regimes, outperforming conventional baselines. This highlights its advantage in fast adaptation and efficient conditional generation for practical molecular design.</p></details> |  |

Existing generative methods are restricted to single-domain molecules, failing to address versatile therapeutic needs or utilize cross-domain transferability to enhance model performance. In this paper, we introduce Unified generative Modeling of 3D Molecules (UniMoMo), the first framework capable of designing binders of multiple molecular domains using a single model. In particular, UniMoMo unifies the representations of different molecules as graphs of blocks, where each block corresponds to either a standard amino acid or a molecular fragment. Subsequently, UniMoMo utilizes a geometric latent diffusion model for 3D molecular generation, featuring an iterative full-atom autoencoder to compress blocks into latent space points, followed by an E(3)-equivariant diffusion process. Extensive benchmarks across peptides, antibodies, and small molecules demonstrate the superiority of our unified framework over existing domain-specific models, highlighting the benefits of multi-domain training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

In recent years, significant progress has been made in molecular representation learning methods, among which multi-modal molecular representation methods based on images, and 2D/3D topologies have become increasingly mainstream. However, existing these multi-modal approaches often directly fuse information from different modalities, overlooking the potential of intermodal interactions and failing to adequately capture the complex higher-order relationships and invariant features between molecules. To overcome these challenges, we propose a structure-awareness-based multi-modal self-supervised molecular representation pre-training framework (MMSA) designed to enhance molecular graph representations by leveraging invariant knowledge between molecules. The framework consists of two main modules: the multi-modal molecular representation learning module and the structure-awareness module. The multi-modal molecular representation learning module collaboratively processes information from different modalities of the same molecule to overcome intermodal differences and generate a unified molecular embedding. Subsequently, the structure-awareness module enhances the molecular representation by constructing a hypergraph structure to model higher-order correlations between molecules. This module also introduces a memory mechanism for storing typical molecular representations, aligning them with memory anchors in the memory bank to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the model generalization ability. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of MMSA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MoleculeNet benchmark, with average ROC-AUC improvements ranging from 1.8% to 9.6% over baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP) 2025</p></details> |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in many domains. However, directly applying LLMs to these tasks faces two major challenges: (i) lacking a large-scale chemical synthesis-related instruction dataset; (ii) ignoring the close correlation between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction for the existing fine-tuning strategies. To address these challenges, we propose ChemDual, a novel LLM framework for accurate chemical synthesis. Specifically, considering the high cost of data acquisition for reaction and retrosynthesis, ChemDual regards the reaction-and-retrosynthesis of molecules as a related recombination-and-fragmentation process and constructs a large-scale of 4.4 million instruction dataset. Furthermore, ChemDual introduces an enhanced LLaMA, equipped with a multi-scale tokenizer and dual-task learning strategy, to jointly optimize the process of recombination and fragmentation as well as the tasks between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction. Extensive experiments on Mol-Instruction and USPTO-50K datasets demonstrate that ChemDual achieves state-of-the-art performance in both predictions of reaction and retrosynthesis, outperforming the existing conventional single-task approaches and the general open-source LLMs. Through molecular docking analysis, ChemDual generates compounds with diverse and strong protein binding affinity, further highlighting its strong potential in drug design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

Previous works in this framework often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on a subset of ZINC dataset, and by employing robust evaluation metrics we show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods for a wide range of drug design tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.09702</p></details> |

| **[Finding Counterfactual Evidences for Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11396v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual learning is emerging as an important paradigm, rooted in causality, which promises to alleviate common issues of graph neural networks (GNNs), such as fairness and interpretability. However, as in many real-world application domains where conducting randomized controlled trials is impractical, one has to rely on available observational (factual) data to detect counterfactuals. In this paper, we introduce and tackle the problem of searching for counterfactual evidences for the GNN-based node classification task. A counterfactual evidence is a pair of nodes such that, regardless they exhibit great similarity both in the features and in their neighborhood subgraph structures, they are classified differently by the GNN. We develop effective and efficient search algorithms and a novel indexing solution that leverages both node features and structural information to identify counterfactual evidences, and generalizes beyond any specific GNN. Through various downstream applications, we demonstrate the potential of counterfactual evidences to enhance fairness and accuracy of GNNs.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |
| **[What Can We Learn From MIMO Graph Convolutions?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11346v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most graph neural networks (GNNs) utilize approximations of the general graph convolution derived in the graph Fourier domain. While GNNs are typically applied in the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) case, the approximations are performed in the single-input single-output (SISO) case. In this work, we first derive the MIMO graph convolution through the convolution theorem and approximate it directly in the MIMO case. We find the key MIMO-specific property of the graph convolution to be operating on multiple computational graphs, or equivalently, applying distinct feature transformations for each pair of nodes. As a localized approximation, we introduce localized MIMO graph convolutions (LMGCs), which generalize many linear message-passing neural networks. For almost every choice of edge weights, we prove that LMGCs with a single computational graph are injective on multisets, and the resulting representations are linearly independent when more than one computational graph is used. Our experimental results confirm that an LMGC can combine the benefits of various methods.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |
| **[The Final Layer Holds the Key: A Unified and Efficient GNN Calibration Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11335v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness on graph-based tasks. However, their predictive confidence is often miscalibrated, typically exhibiting under-confidence, which harms the reliability of their decisions. Existing calibration methods for GNNs normally introduce additional calibration components, which fail to capture the intrinsic relationship between the model and the prediction confidence, resulting in limited theoretical guarantees and increased computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet efficient graph calibration method. We establish a unified theoretical framework revealing that model confidence is jointly governed by class-centroid-level and node-level calibration at the final layer. Based on this insight, we theoretically show that reducing the weight decay of the final-layer parameters alleviates GNN under-confidence by acting on the class-centroid level, while node-level calibration acts as a finer-grained complement to class-centroid level calibration, which encourages each test node to be closer to its predicted class centroid at the final-layer representations. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Representational Learning: When Does More Expressivity Hurt Generalization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11298v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning on structured data, yet the relationship between their expressivity and predictive performance remains unclear. We introduce a family of premetrics that capture different degrees of structural similarity between graphs and relate these similarities to generalization, and consequently, the performance of expressive GNNs. By considering a setting where graph labels are correlated with structural features, we derive generalization bounds that depend on the distance between training and test graphs, model complexity, and training set size. These bounds reveal that more expressive GNNs may generalize worse unless their increased complexity is balanced by a sufficiently large training set or reduced distance between training and test graphs. Our findings relate expressivity and generalization, offering theoretical insights supported by empirical results.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate the networked AirComp in multiple clusters allowing diversified data computation, which is yet challenged by the transceiver coordination and interference management therein. Particularly, we aim to maximize the multi-cluster weighted-sum AirComp rate, where the transmission scalar as well as receive beamforming are jointly investigated while addressing the interference issue. From an optimization perspective, we decompose the formulated problem and adopt the alternating optimization technique with an iterative process to approximate the solution. Then, we reinterpret the iterations through the principle of algorithm unfolding, where the channel condition and mutual interference in the AirComp network constitute an underlying graph. Accordingly, the proposed unfolding architecture learns the weights parameterized by graph neural networks, which is trained through stochastic gradient descent approach. Simulation results show that our proposals outperform the conventional schemes, and the proposed unfolded graph learning substantially alleviates the interference and achieves superior computation performance, with strong and efficient adaptation to the dynamic and scalable networks.</p></details> | Accepted @ IEEE TWC |

Traditional methods require iterative simulations to reach equilibrium, making real-time or large-scale scenario analysis challenging. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach using Message-Passing Neural Networks as a metamodel to approximate the equilibrium flow of the Stochastic User Equilibrium assignment. Our model is designed to mimic the algorithmic structure used in conventional traffic simulators allowing it to better capture the underlying process rather than just the data. We benchmark it against other conventional deep learning techniques and evaluate the model's robustness by testing its ability to predict traffic flows on input data outside the domain on which it was trained. This approach offers a promising solution for accelerating out-of-distribution scenario assessments, reducing computational costs in large-scale transportation planning, and enabling real-time decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[IssueCourier: Multi-Relational Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network for Open-Source Issue Assignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11205v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue assignment plays a critical role in open-source software (OSS) maintenance, which involves recommending the most suitable developers to address the reported issues. Given the high volume of issue reports in large-scale projects, manually assigning issues is tedious and costly. Previous studies have proposed automated issue assignment approaches that primarily focus on modeling issue report textual information, developers' expertise, or interactions between issues and developers based on historical issue-fixing records. However, these approaches often suffer from performance limitations due to the presence of incorrect and missing labels in OSS datasets, as well as the long tail of developer contributions and the changes of developer activity as the project evolves. To address these challenges, we propose IssueCourier, a novel Multi-Relational Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network approach for issue assignment. Specifically, we formalize five key relationships among issues, developers, and source code files to construct a heterogeneous graph. Then, we further adopt a temporal slicing technique that partitions the graph into a sequence of time-based subgraphs to learn stage-specific patterns. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark dataset with relabeled ground truth to address the problem of incorrect and missing labels in existing OSS datasets. Finally, to evaluate the performance of IssueCourier, we conduct extensive experiments on our benchmark dataset. The results show that IssueCourier can improve over the best baseline up to 45.49% in top-1 and 31.97% in MRR.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). Where previous works relied on semi-local functionals or fixed-size descriptors of the density, we compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud for efficient non-local atomic-range interactions. By applying an equivariant GNN on this point cloud, we capture molecular-range interactions in a scalable and accurate manner. To train EG-XC, we differentiate through a self-consistent field solver requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Representation Learning, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Covariance Density Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11139v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have re-defined how we model and predict on network data but there lacks a consensus on choosing the correct underlying graph structure on which to model signals. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNN) address this issue by using the sample covariance matrix as a Graph Shift Operator (GSO). Here, we improve on the performance of VNNs by constructing a Density Matrix where we consider the sample Covariance matrix as a quasi-Hamiltonian of the system in the space of random variables. Crucially, using this density matrix as the GSO allows components of the data to be extracted at different scales, allowing enhanced discriminability and performance. We show that this approach allows explicit control of the stability-discriminability trade-off of the network, provides enhanced robustness to noise compared to VNNs, and outperforms them in useful real-life applications where the underlying covariance matrix is informative. In particular, we show that our model can achieve strong performance in subject-independent Brain Computer Interface EEG motor imagery classification, outperforming EEGnet while being faster. This shows how covariance density neural networks provide a basis for the notoriously difficult task of transferability of BCIs when evaluated on unseen individuals.</p></details> |  |

Our method consists of a fully deep learning based approach combining a visual backbone coupled with a SplineCNN graph neural network for feature processing and a normalized transformer decoder for decoding keypoint correspondences together with the Sinkhorn algorithm. Our method is trained using a contrastive and a hyperspherical loss for better feature representations. We additionally use data augmentation during training. This comparatively simple architecture combining extensive normalization and advanced losses outperforms current state of the art approaches on PascalVOC and SPair-71k datasets by $5.1\%$ and $2.2\%$ respectively compared to BBGM, ASAR, COMMON and GMTR while training for at least $1.7x$ fewer epochs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Halting Recurrent GNNs and the Graded $μ$-Calculus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11050v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of machine-learning models that operate on graph-structured data. Their expressive power is intimately related to logics that are invariant under graded bisimilarity. Current proposals for recurrent GNNs either assume that the graph size is given to the model, or suffer from a lack of termination guarantees. In this paper, we propose a halting mechanism for recurrent GNNs. We prove that our halting model can express all node classifiers definable in graded modal mu-calculus, even for the standard GNN variant that is oblivious to the graph size. A recent breakthrough in the study of the expressivity of graded modal mu-calculus in the finite suggests that conversely, restricted to node classifiers definable in monadic second-order logic, recurrent GNNs can express only node classifiers definable in graded modal mu-calculus. To prove our main result, we develop a new approximate semantics for graded mu-calculus, which we believe to be of independent interest. We leverage this new semantics into a new model-checking algorithm, called the counting algorithm, which is oblivious to the graph size. In a final step we show that the counting algorithm can be implemented on a halting recurrent GNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuroLifting: Neural Inference on Markov Random Fields at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18954v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference in large-scale Markov Random Fields (MRFs) is a critical yet challenging task, traditionally approached through approximate methods like belief propagation and mean field, or exact methods such as the Toulbar2 solver. These strategies often fail to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and solution quality, particularly as the problem scale increases. This paper introduces NeuroLifting, a novel technique that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to reparameterize decision variables in MRFs, facilitating the use of standard gradient descent optimization. By extending traditional lifting techniques into a non-parametric neural network framework, NeuroLifting benefits from the smooth loss landscape of neural networks, enabling efficient and parallelizable optimization. Empirical results demonstrate that, on moderate scales, NeuroLifting performs very close to the exact solver Toulbar2 in terms of solution quality, significantly surpassing existing approximate methods. Notably, on large-scale MRFs, NeuroLifting delivers superior solution quality against all baselines, as well as exhibiting linear computational complexity growth. This work presents a significant advancement in MRF inference, offering a scalable and effective solution for large-scale problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relational Graph Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10960v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is a promising approach for building state-of-the-art predictive models on multi-table relational data by representing it as a heterogeneous temporal graph. However, commonly used Graph Neural Network models suffer from fundamental limitations in capturing complex structural patterns and long-range dependencies that are inherent in relational data. While Graph Transformers have emerged as powerful alternatives to GNNs on general graphs, applying them to relational entity graphs presents unique challenges: (i) Traditional positional encodings fail to generalize to massive, heterogeneous graphs; (ii) existing architectures cannot model the temporal dynamics and schema constraints of relational data; (iii) existing tokenization schemes lose critical structural information. Here we introduce the Relational Graph Transformer (RelGT), the first graph transformer architecture designed specifically for relational tables. RelGT employs a novel multi-element tokenization strategy that decomposes each node into five components (features, type, hop distance, time, and local structure), enabling efficient encoding of heterogeneity, temporality, and topology without expensive precomputation. Our architecture combines local attention over sampled subgraphs with global attention to learnable centroids, incorporating both local and database-wide representations. Across 21 tasks from the RelBench benchmark, RelGT consistently matches or outperforms GNN baselines by up to 18%, establishing Graph Transformers as a powerful architecture for Relational Deep Learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/snap-stanford/relgt</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for Effective Label-free Node Classification in Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11983v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the preferred models for node classification in graph data due to their robust capabilities in integrating graph structures and attributes. However, these models heavily depend on a substantial amount of high-quality labeled data for training, which is often costly to obtain. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), a promising approach is to utilize their exceptional zero-shot capabilities and extensive knowledge for node labeling. Despite encouraging results, this approach either requires numerous queries to LLMs or suffers from reduced performance due to noisy labels generated by LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce Locle, an active self-training framework that does Label-free node Classification with LLMs cost-Effectively. Locle iteratively identifies small sets of "critical" samples using GNNs and extracts informative pseudo-labels for them with both LLMs and GNNs, serving as additional supervision signals to enhance model training. Specifically, Locle comprises three key components: (i) an effective active node selection strategy for initial annotations; (ii) a careful sample selection scheme to identify "critical" nodes based on label disharmonicity and entropy; and (iii) a label refinement module that combines LLMs and GNNs with a rewired topology. Extensive experiments on five benchmark text-attributed graph datasets demonstrate that Locle significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same query budget to LLMs in terms of label-free node classification. Notably, on the DBLP dataset with 14.3k nodes, Locle achieves an 8.08% improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art at a cost of less than one cent.

However, when data is scarce, GNNs suffer from overfitting, leading to poor performance. Recently, Gaussian processes (GPs) with graph-level inputs have been proposed as an alternative. In this work, we extend the Gaussian process framework to simplicial complexes (SCs), enabling the handling of edge-level attributes and attributes supported on higher-order simplices. We further augment the resulting SC representations by considering their Hodge decompositions, allowing us to account for homological information, such as the number of holes, in the SC. We demonstrate that our framework enhances the predictions across various applications, paving the way for GPs to be more widely used for graph and SC-level predictions.</p></details> |  |

However, training GNNs on large-scale graphs poses significant challenges due to high memory demands and significant communication overhead in distributed settings. Traditional sampling-based approaches mitigate computation load to some extent but often fail to address communication inefficiencies inherent in distributed environments. This paper presents RapidGNN that introduces a deterministic sampling strategy to precompute mini-batches. By leveraging the sampling strategy, RapidGNN accurately anticipates feature access patterns, enabling optimal cache construction and timely prefetching of remote features. This reduces the frequency and latency of remote data transfers without compromising the stochastic nature of training. Evaluations on Reddit and OGBN-Products datasets demonstrate that RapidGNN achieves significant reductions in training time and remote feature fetches, outperforming existing models in both communication efficiency and throughput. Our findings highlight RapidGNN's potential for scalable, high-performance GNN training across large, real-world graph datasets along with improving energy efficiency. Our model improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.10x on average over SOTA model GraphSAGE-METIS (up to 2.45x in some settings), while cutting remote feature fetches by over 4x. It also reduces energy consumption up to 23%.</p></details> |  |

However, the fundamental properties of this approach remain underexplored. To address this issue, we propose conducting a more in-depth analysis of this issue based on the interchange intervention method. First, we construct a synthetic graph dataset with controllable causal relationships, enabling precise manipulation of semantic relationships and causal modeling to provide data for analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct interchange interventions to examine the deeper properties of LLM enhancers and GNNs, uncovering their underlying logic and internal mechanisms. Building on the analytical results, we design a plug-and-play optimization module to improve the information transfer between LLM enhancers and GNNs.

However, existing graph neural network methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.</p></details> | 18 pages,3 figuares |

GNN-Suite standardises experimentation and reproducibility using the Nextflow workflow to evaluate GNN performance. We demonstrate its utility in identifying cancer-driver genes by constructing molecular networks from protein-protein interaction (PPI) data from STRING and BioGRID and annotating nodes with features from the PCAWG, PID, and COSMIC-CGC repositories. Our design enables fair comparisons among diverse GNN architectures including GAT, GAT3H, GCN, GCN2, GIN, GTN, HGCN, PHGCN, and GraphSAGE and a baseline Logistic Regression (LR) model. All GNNs were configured as standardised two-layer models and trained with uniform hyperparameters (dropout = 0.2; Adam optimiser with learning rate = 0.01; and an adjusted binary cross-entropy loss to address class imbalance) over an 80/20 train-test split for 300 epochs. Each model was evaluated over 10 independent runs with different random seeds to yield statistically robust performance metrics, with balanced accuracy (BACC) as the primary measure. Notably, GCN2 achieved the highest BACC (0.807 +/- 0.035) on a STRING-based network, although all GNN types outperformed the LR baseline, highlighting the advantage of network-based learning over feature-only approaches. Our results show that a common framework for implementing and evaluating GNN architectures aids in identifying not only the best model but also the most effective means of incorporating complementary data. By making GNN-Suite publicly available, we aim to foster reproducible research and promote improved benchmarking standards in computational biology.

Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code will be released upon acceptance</p></details> |

However, their performance often degrades under distribution shifts between the training and test-time images. Existing methods for identifying and quantifying distribution shifts typically require access to clean test images, which are almost never available while solving inverse problems (at test time). We propose a fully unsupervised metric for estimating distribution shifts using only indirect (corrupted) measurements and score functions from diffusion models trained on different datasets. We theoretically show that this metric estimates the KL divergence between the training and test image distributions. Empirically, we show that our score-based metric, using only corrupted measurements, closely approximates the KL divergence computed from clean images. Motivated by this result, we show that aligning the out-of-distribution score with the in-distribution score -- using only corrupted measurements -- reduces the KL divergence and leads to improved reconstruction quality across multiple inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

However, diffusion models often suffer from slow inference due to costly denoising processes or require complex sequential training arising from recent distilling approaches. This paper introduces Riemannian Flow Matching Policy (RFMP), a model that inherits the easy training and fast inference capabilities of flow matching (FM). Moreover, RFMP inherently incorporates geometric constraints commonly found in realistic robotic applications, as the robot state resides on a Riemannian manifold. To enhance the robustness of RFMP, we propose Stable RFMP (SRFMP), which leverages LaSalle's invariance principle to equip the dynamics of FM with stability to the support of a target Riemannian distribution. Rigorous evaluation on eight simulated and real-world tasks show that RFMP successfully learns and synthesizes complex sensorimotor policies on Euclidean and Riemannian spaces with efficient training and inference phases, outperforming Diffusion Policies and Consistency Policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 12 figures, 12 tables, project website: https://sites.google.com/view/rfmp</p></details> |

Recent works like LayerDiffuse have extended the previous single-layer, unified image generation paradigm to transparent image layer generation. However, existing multi-layer generation methods fail to handle the interactions among multiple layers such as rational global layout, physics-plausible contacts and visual effects like shadows and reflections while maintaining high alpha quality. To solve this problem, we propose PSDiffusion, a unified diffusion framework for simultaneous multi-layer text-to-image generation. Our model can automatically generate multi-layer images with one RGB background and multiple RGBA foregrounds through a single feed-forward process. Unlike existing methods that combine multiple tools for post-decomposition or generate layers sequentially and separately, our method introduces a global-layer interactive mechanism that generates layered-images concurrently and collaboratively, ensuring not only high quality and completeness for each layer, but also spatial and visual interactions among layers for global coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/dingbang777/PSDiffusion/</p></details> |
| **[Exploiting Radiance Fields for Grasp Generation on Novel Synthetic Views](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11467v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision based robot manipulation uses cameras to capture one or more images of a scene containing the objects to be manipulated. Taking multiple images can help if any object is occluded from one viewpoint but more visible from another viewpoint. However, the camera has to be moved to a sequence of suitable positions for capturing multiple images, which requires time and may not always be possible, due to reachability constraints. So while additional images can produce more accurate grasp poses due to the extra information available, the time-cost goes up with the number of additional views sampled. Scene representations like Gaussian Splatting are capable of rendering accurate photorealistic virtual images from user-specified novel viewpoints. In this work, we show initial results which indicate that novel view synthesis can provide additional context in generating grasp poses. Our experiments on the Graspnet-1billion dataset show that novel views contributed force-closure grasps in addition to the force-closure grasps obtained from sparsely sampled real views while also improving grasp coverage. In the future we hope this work can be extended to improve grasp extraction from radiance fields constructed with a single input image, using for example diffusion models or generalizable radiance fields.</p></details> | 6 pages |

However, the explored data are always heterogeneous, posing the requirements of powerful representation abilities for both intrinsic reward models and pre-trained policies. In this work, we propose the Exploratory Diffusion Model (ExDM), which leverages the strong expressive ability of diffusion models to fit the explored data, simultaneously boosting exploration and providing an efficient initialization for downstream tasks. Specifically, ExDM can accurately estimate the distribution of collected data in the replay buffer with the diffusion model and introduces the score-based intrinsic reward, encouraging the agent to explore less-visited states. After obtaining the pre-trained policies, ExDM enables rapid adaptation to downstream tasks. In detail, we provide theoretical analyses and practical algorithms for fine-tuning diffusion policies, addressing key challenges such as training instability and computational complexity caused by multi-step sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExDM outperforms existing SOTA baselines in efficient unsupervised exploration and fast fine-tuning downstream tasks, especially in structurally complicated environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generative Framework for Causal Estimation via Importance-Weighted Diffusion Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11444v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data is a central challenge in causal inference, largely due to covariate imbalance and confounding bias from non-randomized treatment assignment. While inverse probability weighting (IPW) is a well-established solution to this problem, its integration into modern deep learning frameworks remains limited. In this work, we propose Importance-Weighted Diffusion Distillation (IWDD), a novel generative framework that combines the pretraining of diffusion models with importance-weighted score distillation to enable accurate and fast causal estimation-including potential outcome prediction and treatment effect estimation. We demonstrate how IPW can be naturally incorporated into the distillation of pretrained diffusion models, and further introduce a randomization-based adjustment that eliminates the need to compute IPW explicitly-thereby simplifying computation and, more importantly, provably reducing the variance of gradient estimates. Empirical results show that IWDD achieves state-of-the-art out-of-sample prediction performance, with the highest win rates compared to other baselines, significantly improving causal estimation and supporting the development of individualized treatment strategies. We will release our PyTorch code for reproducibility and future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[LipDiffuser: Lip-to-Speech Generation with Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11391v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LipDiffuser, a conditional diffusion model for lip-to-speech generation synthesizing natural and intelligible speech directly from silent video recordings. Our approach leverages the magnitude-preserving ablated diffusion model (MP-ADM) architecture as a denoiser model. To effectively condition the model, we incorporate visual features using magnitude-preserving feature-wise linear modulation (MP-FiLM) alongside speaker embeddings. A neural vocoder then reconstructs the speech waveform from the generated mel-spectrograms. Evaluations on LRS3 and TCD-TIMIT demonstrate that LipDiffuser outperforms existing lip-to-speech baselines in perceptual speech quality and speaker similarity, while remaining competitive in downstream automatic speech recognition (ASR). These findings are also supported by a formal listening experiment. Extensive ablation studies and cross-dataset evaluation confirm the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying the Spread of Online Incivility in Brazilian Politics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08960v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incivility refers to behaviors that violate collective norms and disrupt cooperation within the political process. Although large-scale online data and automated techniques have enabled the quantitative analysis of uncivil discourse, prior research has predominantly focused on impoliteness or toxicity, often overlooking other behaviors that undermine democratic values. To address this gap, we propose a multidimensional conceptual framework encompassing Impoliteness, Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric, Hate Speech and Stereotyping, and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values. Using this framework, we measure the spread of online political incivility in Brazil using approximately 5 million tweets posted by 2,307 political influencers during the 2022 Brazilian general election. Through statistical modeling and network analysis, we examine the dynamics of uncivil posts at different election stages, identify key disseminators and audiences, and explore the mechanisms driving the spread of uncivil information online. Our findings indicate that impoliteness is more likely to surge during election campaigns. In contrast, the other dimensions of incivility are often triggered by specific violent events. Moreover, we find that left-aligned individual influencers are the primary disseminators of online incivility in the Brazilian Twitter/X sphere and that they disseminate not only direct incivility but also indirect incivility when discussing or opposing incivility expressed by others. They relay those content from politicians, media agents, and individuals to reach broader audiences, revealing a diffusion pattern mixing the direct and two-step flows of communication theory. This study offers new insights into the multidimensional nature of incivility in Brazilian politics and provides a conceptual framework that can be extended to other political contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICWSM 2025</p></details> |

Currently, autoregressive modeling approaches have achieved remarkable performance in motion generation tasks, e.g. text-to-motion. However, vector quantization (VQ) accompanying autoregressive generation has inherent disadvantages, including loss of quantization information, low codebook utilization, etc. Moreover, unlike text-to-motion, which focuses solely on the movement of body joints, human action-reaction synthesis also encompasses fine-grained hand movements. In this work, we propose MARRS, a novel framework designed to generate coordinated and fine-grained reaction motions in continuous representations. Initially, we present the Unit-distinguished Motion Variational AutoEncoder (UD-VAE), which segments the entire body into distinct body and hand units, encoding them independently. Subsequently, we propose Action-Conditioned Fusion (ACF), which involves randomly masking a subset of reactive tokens and extracting specific information about the body and hands from the active tokens. Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive Unit Modulation (AUM) to facilitate interaction between body and hand units by using the information from one unit to adaptively modulate the other. Finally, for the diffusion model, we employ a compact MLP as a noise predictor for each distinct body unit and incorporate the diffusion loss to model the probability distribution of each token. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

This requires decomposing mutual information into contributions from individual stimuli and stimulus features fundamentally ill-posed problem with infinitely many possible solutions. We address this by introducing three core axioms, additivity, positivity, and locality that any meaningful stimulus-wise decomposition should satisfy. We then derive a decomposition that meets all three criteria and remains tractable for high-dimensional stimuli. Our decomposition can be efficiently estimated using diffusion models, allowing for scaling up to complex, structured and naturalistic stimuli. Applied to a model of visual neurons, our method quantifies how specific stimuli and features contribute to encoded information. Our approach provides a scalable, interpretable tool for probing representations in both biological and artificial neural systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Steev...</summary><p>Steeve Laquitaine and Simone Azeglio have equal contributions; Ulisse Ferrari and Matthew Chalk have equal senior contributions</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Learning with Partial Agent Participation and Local Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11307v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion learning is a framework that endows edge devices with advanced intelligence. By processing and analyzing data locally and allowing each agent to communicate with its immediate neighbors, diffusion effectively protects the privacy of edge devices, enables real-time response, and reduces reliance on central servers. However, traditional diffusion learning relies on communication at every iteration, leading to communication overhead, especially with large learning models. Furthermore, the inherent volatility of edge devices, stemming from power outages or signal loss, poses challenges to reliable communication between neighboring agents. To mitigate these issues, this paper investigates an enhanced diffusion learning approach incorporating local updates and partial agent participation. Local updates will curtail communication frequency, while partial agent participation will allow for the inclusion of agents based on their availability. We prove that the resulting algorithm is stable in the mean-square error sense and provide a tight analysis of its Mean-Square-Deviation (MSD) performance. Various numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Effective Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting with Fourier Adaptive Noise-Separated Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11306v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Fourier Adaptive Lite Diffusion Architecture (FALDA), a novel probabilistic framework for time series forecasting. First, we introduce the Diffusion Model for Residual Regression (DMRR) framework, which unifies diffusion-based probabilistic regression methods. Within this framework, FALDA leverages Fourier-based decomposition to incorporate a component-specific architecture, enabling tailored modeling of individual temporal components. A conditional diffusion model is utilized to estimate the future noise term, while our proposed lightweight denoiser, DEMA (Decomposition MLP with AdaLN), conditions on the historical noise term to enhance denoising performance. Through mathematical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that FALDA effectively reduces epistemic uncertainty, allowing probabilistic learning to primarily focus on aleatoric uncertainty. Experiments on six real-world benchmarks demonstrate that FALDA consistently outperforms existing probabilistic forecasting approaches across most datasets for long-term time series forecasting while achieving enhanced computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. Notably, FALDA also achieves superior overall performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) point forecasting approaches, with improvements of up to 9%.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Fourier Space Perspective on Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11278v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are state-of-the-art generative models on data modalities such as images, audio, proteins and materials. These modalities share the property of exponentially decaying variance and magnitude in the Fourier domain. Under the standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) forward process of additive white noise, this property results in high-frequency components being corrupted faster and earlier in terms of their Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) than low-frequency ones. The reverse process then generates low-frequency information before high-frequency details. In this work, we study the inductive bias of the forward process of diffusion models in Fourier space. We theoretically analyse and empirically demonstrate that the faster noising of high-frequency components in DDPM results in violations of the normality assumption in the reverse process. Our experiments show that this leads to degraded generation quality of high-frequency components. We then study an alternate forward process in Fourier space which corrupts all frequencies at the same rate, removing the typical frequency hierarchy during generation, and demonstrate marked performance improvements on datasets where high frequencies are primary, while performing on par with DDPM on standard imaging benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

After introducing an appropriate notion of dissipative measure-valued solutions to the PDE system, a numerical scheme is proposed which is shown to generate, in the continuum limit, a dissipative measure-valued solution. The parabolic density part of the limiting measure-valued solution is atomic and converges to its constant state for long times. Furthermore, it is proved that whenever the PDE system possesses a strong solution, the convergence of the approximation scheme holds in the strong sense. The results are based on Young measure theory and a weak-strong stability estimate combining Shannon and Rao entropies. The convergence of the numerical scheme is achieved by means of discrete entropy dissipation inequalities and an artificial diffusion, which vanishes in the continuum limit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in Numerische Mathematik</p></details> |
| **[DRAGON: A Large-Scale Dataset of Realistic Images Generated by Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11257v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable ease of use of diffusion models for image generation has led to a proliferation of synthetic content online. While these models are often employed for legitimate purposes, they are also used to generate fake images that support misinformation and hate speech. Consequently, it is crucial to develop robust tools capable of detecting whether an image has been generated by such models. Many current detection methods, however, require large volumes of sample images for training. Unfortunately, due to the rapid evolution of the field, existing datasets often cover only a limited range of models and quickly become outdated. In this work, we introduce DRAGON, a comprehensive dataset comprising images from 25 diffusion models, spanning both recent advancements and older, well-established architectures. The dataset contains a broad variety of images representing diverse subjects. To enhance image realism, we propose a simple yet effective pipeline that leverages a large language model to expand input prompts, thereby generating more diverse and higher-quality outputs, as evidenced by improvements in standard quality metrics. The dataset is provided in multiple sizes (ranging from extra-small to extra-large) to accomodate different research scenarios. DRAGON is designed to support the forensic community in developing and evaluating detection and attribution techniques for synthetic content. Additionally, the dataset is accompanied by a dedicated test set, intended to serve as a benchmark for assessing the performance of newly developed methods.</p></details> |  |

Despite progress in computer vision, existing benchmarks reveal significant gaps in models' abilities to accurately recognize object attributes and reason about spatial relationships, both essential for dynamic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose MIRAGE, a multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate models' capabilities in Counting (object attribute recognition), Relation (spatial relational reasoning), and Counting with Relation. Through diverse and complex scenarios requiring fine-grained recognition and reasoning, MIRAGE highlights critical limitations in state-of-the-art models, underscoring the need for improved representations and reasoning frameworks. By targeting these foundational abilities, MIRAGE provides a pathway toward spatiotemporal reasoning in future research.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, we are witnessing growing interests in integrating additional structural constraints, typically in the form of coarse bounding boxes, to better guide the generation process in such challenging cases. In this work, we take the idea of structural guidance a step further by making the observation that contemporary image generation models can directly provide a plausible fine-grained structural initialization. We propose a technique that couples this image-based structural guidance with LLM-based instance-level instructions, yielding output images that adhere to all parts of the text prompt, including object counts, instance-level attributes, and spatial relations between instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://tau-vailab.github.io/InstanceGen/</p></details> |

Recent video editing approaches primarily fall into two categories: training-required and training-free methods. While training-based methods incur high computational costs, training-free alternatives often yield suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose DAPE, a high-quality yet cost-effective two-stage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework for video editing. In the first stage, we design an efficient norm-tuning method to enhance temporal consistency in generated videos. The second stage introduces a vision-friendly adapter to improve visual quality. Additionally, we identify critical shortcomings in existing benchmarks, including limited category diversity, imbalanced object distribution, and inconsistent frame counts. To mitigate these issues, we curate a large dataset benchmark comprising 232 videos with rich annotations and 6 editing prompts, enabling objective and comprehensive evaluation of advanced methods. Extensive experiments on existing datasets (BalanceCC, LOVEU-TGVE, RAVE) and our proposed benchmark demonstrate that DAPE significantly improves temporal coherence and text-video alignment while outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose CountDiffusion, a training-free framework aiming at generating images with correct object quantity from textual descriptions. CountDiffusion consists of two stages. In the first stage, an intermediate denoising result is generated by the diffusion model to predict the final synthesized image with one-step denoising, and a counting model is used to count the number of objects in this image. In the second stage, a correction module is used to correct the object quantity by changing the attention map of the object with universal guidance. The proposed CountDiffusion can be plugged into any diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation models without further training. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CountDiffusion, which improves the accurate object quantity generation ability of T2I models by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

While unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are commonly used for indoor farm monitoring, their deployment in greenhouses is often constrained by infrastructure limitations, sensor placement challenges, and operational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we develop a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB-D camera, a 3D LiDAR, and an IMU sensor. The UAV employs a LiDAR-inertial odometry algorithm for precise navigation in GNSS-denied environments and utilizes a 3D multi-object tracking algorithm to estimate the count and weight of cherry tomatoes. We evaluate the system using two dataset: one from a harvesting row and another from a growing row. In the harvesting-row dataset, the proposed system achieves 94.4\% counting accuracy and 87.5\% weight estimation accuracy within a 13.2-meter flight completed in 10.5 seconds. For the growing-row dataset, which consists of occluded unripened fruits, we qualitatively analyze tracking performance and highlight future research directions for improving perception in greenhouse with strong occlusions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of UAVs for efficient robotic yield estimation in commercial greenhouses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 ICRA workshop on field robotics</p></details> |

This might be partially the result of the fact that Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT), a critical training step for MLLMs, has traditionally focused on scaling data volume, but not the compositional complexity of training examples. We propose COMPACT (COMPositional Atomic-to-complex visual Capability Tuning), which generates a training dataset explicitly controlling for the compositional complexity of the training examples. The data from COMPACT allows MLLMs to train on combinations of atomic capabilities to learn complex capabilities more efficiently. Across all benchmarks, COMPACT achieves comparable performance to the LLaVA-665k VIT while using less than 10% of its data budget, and even outperforms it on several, especially those involving complex multi-capability tasks. For example, COMPACT achieves substantial 83.3% improvement on MMStar and 94.0% improvement on MM-Vet compared to the full-scale VIT on particularly complex questions that require four or more atomic capabilities. COMPACT offers a scalable, data-efficient, visual compositional tuning recipe to improve on complex visual-language tasks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |

While prior studies suggest that different CLIP-ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, most MLLMs still select visual features based on empirical heuristics rather than systematic analysis. In this work, we propose a Layer-wise Representation Similarity approach to group CLIP-ViT layers with similar behaviors into {shallow, middle, and deep} categories and assess their impact on MLLM performance. Building on this foundation, we revisit the visual layer selection problem in MLLMs at scale, training LLaVA-style models ranging from 1.4B to 7B parameters. Through extensive experiments across 10 datasets and 4 tasks, we find that: (1) deep layers are essential for OCR tasks; (2) shallow and middle layers substantially outperform deep layers on reasoning tasks involving counting, positioning, and object localization; (3) a lightweight fusion of features across shallow, middle, and deep layers consistently outperforms specialized fusion baselines and single-layer selections, achieving gains on 9 out of 10 datasets. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, laying the groundwork for deeper investigations into visual representation learning for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Class-Agnostic Counting: Advancements from Reference-Based to Open-World Text-Guided Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19184v3)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual object counting has recently shifted towards class-agnostic counting (CAC), which addresses the challenge of counting objects across arbitrary categories -- a crucial capability for flexible and generalizable counting systems. Unlike humans, who effortlessly identify and count objects from diverse categories without prior knowledge, most existing counting methods are restricted to enumerating instances of known classes, requiring extensive labeled datasets for training and struggling in open-vocabulary settings. In contrast, CAC aims to count objects belonging to classes never seen during training, operating in a few-shot setting. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive review of CAC methodologies. We propose a taxonomy to categorize CAC approaches into three paradigms based on how target object classes can be specified: reference-based, reference-less, and open-world text-guided. Reference-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance by relying on exemplar-guided mechanisms. Reference-less methods eliminate exemplar dependency by leveraging inherent image patterns. Finally, open-world text-guided methods use vision-language models, enabling object class descriptions via textual prompts, offering a flexible and promising solution. Based on this taxonomy, we provide an overview of the architectures of 29 CAC approaches and report their results on gold-standard benchmarks. We compare their performance and discuss their strengths and limitations. Specifically, we present results on the FSC-147 dataset, setting a leaderboard using gold-standard metrics, and on the CARPK dataset to assess generalization capabilities. Finally, we offer a critical discussion of persistent challenges, such as annotation dependency and generalization, alongside future directions. We believe this survey will be a valuable resource, showcasing CAC advancements and guiding future research.</p></details> |  |

Different from previous works that are limited to singulating them using suction cups or soft grippers, RoTipBot can count multiple layers and then grasp them simultaneously in a single grasp closure. Specifically, we first develop a vision-based tactile sensor named RoTip that can rotate and sense contact information around its tip. Equipped with two RoTip sensors, RoTipBot rolls and feeds multiple layers of thin, flexible objects into the centre between its fingers, enabling effective grasping. Moreover, we design a tactile-based grasping strategy that uses RoTip's sensing ability to ensure both fingers maintain secure contact with the object while accurately counting the number of fed objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the RoTip sensor and the RoTipBot approach. The results show that RoTipBot not only achieves a higher success rate but also grasps and counts multiple layers simultaneously -- capabilities not possible with previous methods. Furthermore, RoTipBot operates up to three times faster than state-of-the-art methods. The success of RoTipBot paves the way for future research in object manipulation using mobilised tactile sensors.

However, widely adopted naive fine-tuning strategies concentrate exclusively on text-image consistency for categories contained in training, which leads to limited generalizability for unseen categories. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play Semantic-Driven Visual Prompt Tuning framework (SDVPT) that transfers knowledge from the training set to unseen categories with minimal overhead in parameters and inference time. First, we introduce a two-stage visual prompt learning strategy composed of Category-Specific Prompt Initialization (CSPI) and Topology-Guided Prompt Refinement (TGPR). The CSPI generates category-specific visual prompts, and then TGPR distills latent structural patterns from the VLM's text encoder to refine these prompts. During inference, we dynamically synthesize the visual prompts for unseen categories based on the semantic correlation between unseen and training categories, facilitating robust text-image alignment for unseen categories. Extensive experiments integrating SDVPT with all available open-world object counting models demonstrate its effectiveness and adaptability across three widely used datasets: FSC-147, CARPK, and PUCPR+.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPTURe: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Occluded Object Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15485v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty counting in images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/atinpothiraj/CAPTURe</p></details> |
| **[ProgRoCC: A Progressive Approach to Rough Crowd Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13405v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the number of individuals in a crowd grows, enumeration-based techniques become increasingly infeasible and their estimates increasingly unreliable. We propose instead an estimation-based version of the problem: we label Rough Crowd Counting that delivers better accuracy on the basis of training data that is easier to acquire. Rough crowd counting requires only rough annotations of the number of targets in an image, instead of the more traditional, and far more expensive, per-target annotations. We propose an approach to the rough crowd counting problem based on CLIP, termed ProgRoCC. Specifically, we introduce a progressive estimation learning strategy that determines the object count through a coarse-to-fine approach. This approach delivers answers quickly, outperforms the state-of-the-art in semi- and weakly-supervised crowd counting. In addition, we design a vision-language matching adapter that optimizes key-value pairs by mining effective matches of two modalities to refine the visual features, thereby improving the final performance. Extensive experimental results on three widely adopted crowd counting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[LAD-Reasoner: Tiny Multimodal Models are Good Reasoners for Logical Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12749v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in industrial anomaly detection have highlighted the need for deeper logical anomaly analysis, where unexpected relationships among objects, counts, and spatial configurations must be identified and explained. Existing approaches often rely on large-scale external reasoning modules or elaborate pipeline designs, hindering practical deployment and interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Logical Anomaly Detection (RLAD), which extends traditional anomaly detection by incorporating logical reasoning. We propose a new framework, LAD-Reasoner, a customized tiny multimodal language model built on Qwen2.5-VL 3B. Our approach leverages a two-stage training paradigm that first employs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for fine-grained visual understanding, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine logical anomaly detection and enforce coherent, human-readable reasoning. Crucially, reward signals are derived from both the detection accuracy and the structural quality of the outputs, obviating the need for building chain of thought (CoT) reasoning data. Experiments on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset show that LAD-Reasoner, though significantly smaller, matches the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B in accuracy and F1 score, and further excels in producing concise and interpretable rationales. This unified design reduces reliance on large models and complex pipelines, while offering transparent and interpretable insights into logical anomaly detection. Code and data will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Limits of Vision Language Models Through the Lens of the Binding Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00238v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has documented striking heterogeneity in the performance of state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), including both multimodal language models and text-to-image models. These models are able to describe and generate a diverse array of complex, naturalistic images, yet they exhibit surprising failures on basic multi-object reasoning tasks -- such as counting, localization, and simple forms of visual analogy -- that humans perform with near perfect accuracy. To better understand this puzzling pattern of successes and failures, we turn to theoretical accounts of the binding problem in cognitive science and neuroscience, a fundamental problem that arises when a shared set of representational resources must be used to represent distinct entities (e.g., to represent multiple objects in an image), necessitating the use of serial processing to avoid interference. We find that many of the puzzling failures of state-of-the-art VLMs can be explained as arising due to the binding problem, and that these failure modes are strikingly similar to the limitations exhibited by rapid, feedforward processing in the human brain.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose an annotation-free approach that enables the seamless integration of new fine-grained categories into existing few/zero-shot counting models. By leveraging latent generative models, we synthesize high-quality, category-specific crowded scenes, providing a rich training source for adapting to new categories without manual labeling. Our approach introduces an attention prediction network that identifies fine-grained category boundaries trained using only synthetic pseudo-annotated data. At inference, these fine-grained attention estimates refine the output of existing few/zero-shot counting networks. To benchmark our method, we further introduce the FGTC dataset, a taxonomy-specific fine-grained object counting dataset for natural images. Our method substantially enhances pre-trained state-of-the-art models on fine-grained taxon counting tasks, while using only synthetic data. Code and data to be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

The deployment of a SNN usually requires partitioning the network and mapping these partitions onto the hardware's processing units. However, finding optimal deployment configurations is an NP-hard problem, often addressed through optimization algorithms. While some objectives (e.g., memory utilization and chip count) are static, others (e.g., communication latency and energy efficiency) depend on the network's dynamic behavior, necessitating dynamic-aware optimization. To address this, we model SNN dynamics using an Ising-type pairwise interaction framework, bridging microscopic neuron interactions with macroscopic network behavior. We optimize deployment by exploring the parameter and configuration spaces of the Ising model. We evaluate our approach on two SNNs deployed on the sPyNNaker neuromorphic platform. Initial results suggest that the method underperforms, potentially due to the Ising model's equilibrium assumptions and the architectural complexity of real-world neuromorphic hardware, highlighting limitations in its current formulation. Update: The method proposed is with a equilibrium-dynamics SNN assumption, and the original paper does not mention this. The paper needs to be revisited and reuploaded after further experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[COUNTS: Benchmarking Object Detectors and Multimodal Large Language Models under Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10158v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current object detectors often suffer significant perfor-mance degradation in real-world applications when encountering distributional shifts. Consequently, the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capability of object detectors has garnered increasing attention from researchers. Despite this growing interest, there remains a lack of a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and evaluation benchmark with fine-grained annotations tailored to assess the OOD generalization on more intricate tasks like object detection and grounding. To address this gap, we introduce COUNTS, a large-scale OOD dataset with object-level annotations. COUNTS encompasses 14 natural distributional shifts, over 222K samples, and more than 1,196K labeled bounding boxes. Leveraging COUNTS, we introduce two novel benchmarks: O(OD)2 and OODG. O(OD)2 is designed to comprehensively evaluate the OOD generalization capabilities of object detectors by utilizing controlled distribution shifts between training and testing data. OODG, on the other hand, aims to assess the OOD generalization of grounding abilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our findings reveal that, while large models and extensive pre-training data substantially en hance performance in in-distribution (IID) scenarios, significant limitations and opportunities for improvement persist in OOD contexts for both object detectors and MLLMs. In visual grounding tasks, even the advanced GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 only achieve 56.7% and 28.0% accuracy, respectively. We hope COUNTS facilitates advancements in the development and assessment of robust object detectors and MLLMs capable of maintaining high performance under distributional shifts.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that employs Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting, enhancing image-text alignment and facilitating more coherent multi-object image editing. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the self-correction task into three critical dimensions (counting, attributes, and spatial relationships), and further divided into object-level subtasks. We construct a multi-agent editing system featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To resolve the problem of subtask integration, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother that employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtask results, thereby enhancing runtime efficiency while eliminating multi-stage distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, real-time interactive environments impose new demands on VLMs, requiring them to generate utterances that are not only semantically accurate but also precisely timed. We identify two core capabilities necessary for such settings -- $\textit{perceptual updating}$ and $\textit{contingency awareness}$ -- and propose a new benchmark task, $\textbf{Temporally-Grounded Language Generation (TGLG)}$, to evaluate them. TGLG requires models to generate utterances in response to streaming video such that both content and timing align with dynamic visual input. To support this benchmark, we curate evaluation datasets from sports broadcasting and egocentric human interaction domains, and introduce a new metric, $\textbf{TRACE}$, to evaluate TGLG by jointly measuring semantic similarity and temporal alignment. Finally, we present $\textbf{Vision-Language Model with Time-Synchronized Interleaving (VLM-TSI)}$, a model that interleaves visual and linguistic tokens in a time-synchronized manner, enabling real-time language generation without relying on turn-based assumptions. Experimental results show that VLM-TSI significantly outperforms a strong baseline, yet overall performance remains modest -- highlighting the difficulty of TGLG and motivating further research in real-time VLMs. Code and data available $\href{https://github.com/yukw777/tglg}{here}$.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Redundancy-Aware Pretraining of Vision-Language Foundation Models in Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11121v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of foundation models through pretraining of vision-language models (VLMs) has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). VLM pretraining aims to learn image and language alignments from a large number of image-text pairs. Each pretraining image is often associated with multiple captions containing redundant information due to repeated or semantically similar phrases, resulting in increased pretraining and inference time. To overcome this, we introduce a weighted feature aggregation (WFA) strategy for VLM pretraining in RS. Our strategy aims to extract and exploit complementary information from multiple captions per image while reducing redundancies through feature aggregation with importance weighting. To calculate adaptive importance weights for different captions of each image, we propose two techniques: (i) non-parametric uniqueness and (ii) learning-based attention. In the first technique, importance weights are calculated based on the bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores of the captions to emphasize unique sentences and reduce the influence of repetitive ones. In the second technique, importance weights are learned through an attention mechanism instead of relying on hand-crafted features. The effectiveness of the proposed WFA strategy with the two techniques is analyzed in terms of downstream performance on text-to-image retrieval in RS. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy enables efficient and effective pretraining of VLMs in RS. Based on the experimental analysis, we derive guidelines for selecting appropriate techniques depending on downstream task requirements and resource constraints.

| **[Mitigate Language Priors in Large Vision-Language Models by Cross-Images Contrastive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10634v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language priors constitute one of the primary causes of hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), driving the models to generate linguistically plausible yet visually inconsistent content. The language priors in LVLMs originate from the linguistic knowledge inherited from their pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) backbone. Consequently, this characteristic is an intrinsic property of the model that remains independent of visual inputs. Inspired by the finding that language priors are consistent across images, we propose Cross-Image Contrastive Decoding (CICD), a simple yet effective training-free method to alleviate language priors in LVLMs. CICD first identifies essential and detrimental priors, and then employs contrastive decoding to eliminate the detrimental ones. This approach simultaneously prevents LVLMs from generating hallucinated content while maintaining textual fluency and coherence. Furthermore, the limited information overlap between images helps prevent visual information loss during contrastive decoding. We validate the effectiveness of CICD on four benchmarks with six LVLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that CICD performs remarkably well in mitigating language priors, especially in the image captioning task, where such priors are most pronounced. Code will be released once accepted.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we propose leveraging code as supervision for cross-modal alignment, since code inherently encodes all information needed to generate corresponding figures, establishing a precise connection between the two modalities. Specifically, we co-develop our image-to-code model and dataset with model-in-the-loop approach, resulting in an image-to-code model, FigCodifier and ImgCode-8.6M dataset, the largest image-code dataset to date. Furthermore, we utilize FigCodifier to synthesize novel mathematical figures and then construct MM-MathInstruct-3M, a high-quality multimodal math instruction fine-tuning dataset. Finally, we present MathCoder-VL, trained with ImgCode-8.6M for cross-modal alignment and subsequently fine-tuned on MM-MathInstruct-3M for multimodal math problem solving. Our model achieves a new open-source SOTA across all six metrics. Notably, it surpasses GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the geometry problem-solving subset of MathVista, achieving improvements of 8.9% and 9.2%.

In data-scarce settings, the quality of these pretrained models becomes crucial for effective transfer learning. Image classification and self-supervised learning have traditionally been the primary methods for pretraining CNNs and transformer-based architectures. Recently, the rise of text-to-image generative models, particularly those using denoising diffusion in a latent space, has introduced a new class of foundational models trained on massive, captioned image datasets. These models' ability to generate realistic images of unseen content suggests they possess a deep understanding of the visual world. In this work, we present Marigold, a family of conditional generative models and a fine-tuning protocol that extracts the knowledge from pretrained latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and adapts them for dense image analysis tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normals prediction, and intrinsic decomposition. Marigold requires minimal modification of the pre-trained latent diffusion model's architecture, trains with small synthetic datasets on a single GPU over a few days, and demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization.

| **[Prioritizing Image-Related Tokens Enhances Vision-Language Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08971v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In standard large vision-language models (LVLMs) pre-training, the model typically maximizes the joint probability of the caption conditioned on the image via next-token prediction (NTP); however, since only a small subset of caption tokens directly relates to the visual content, this naive NTP unintentionally fits the model to noise and increases the risk of hallucination. We present PRIOR, a simple vision-language pre-training approach that addresses this issue by prioritizing image-related tokens through differential weighting in the NTP loss, drawing from the importance sampling framework. PRIOR introduces a reference model-a text-only large language model (LLM) trained on the captions without image inputs, to weight each token based on its probability for LVLMs training. Intuitively, tokens that are directly related to the visual inputs are harder to predict without the image and thus receive lower probabilities from the text-only reference LLM. During training, we implement a token-specific re-weighting term based on the importance scores to adjust each token's loss. We implement PRIOR in two distinct settings: LVLMs with visual encoders and LVLMs without visual encoders. We observe 19% and 8% average relative improvement, respectively, on several vision-language benchmarks compared to NTP. In addition, PRIOR exhibits superior scaling properties, as demonstrated by significantly higher scaling coefficients, indicating greater potential for performance gains compared to NTP given increasing compute and data.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code will be available at https://github.com/Yangyi-Chen/PRIOR</p></details> |

Their comprehension and reasoning capabilities enable promising applications in autonomous driving scenarios. However, existing research typically focuses on front-view perspectives and partial objects within scenes, struggling to achieve comprehensive scene understanding. Meanwhile, existing LVLMs suffer from the lack of mapping relationship between 2D and 3D and insufficient integration of 3D object localization and instruction understanding. To tackle these limitations, we first introduce NuInteract, a large-scale dataset with over 1.5M multi-view image language pairs spanning dense scene captions and diverse interactive tasks. Furthermore, we propose DriveMonkey, a simple yet effective framework that seamlessly integrates LVLMs with a spatial processor using a series of learnable queries. The spatial processor, designed as a plug-and-play component, can be initialized with pre-trained 3D detectors to improve 3D perception. Our experiments show that DriveMonkey outperforms general LVLMs, especially achieving a 9.86% notable improvement on the 3D visual grounding task.

To address this, we propose Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), which enhances fine-grained understanding through three key innovations. First, we leverage large multimodal models to generate 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for capturing global-level semantic details. Second, a high-quality dataset is constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic differences. We construct a comprehensive dataset, termed FgGRN, by integrating high-quality region-specific annotations with challenging fine-grained negative samples. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks, including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection, image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks. These results highlight FG-CLIP's effectiveness in capturing fine-grained image details and improving overall model performance.

| **[Semantic and Expressive Variation in Image Captions Across Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14356v5)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer vision often treats human perception as homogeneous: an implicit assumption that visual stimuli are perceived similarly by everyone. This assumption is reflected in the way researchers collect datasets and train vision models. By contrast, literature in cross-cultural psychology and linguistics has provided evidence that people from different cultural backgrounds observe vastly different concepts even when viewing the same visual stimuli. In this paper, we study how these differences manifest themselves in vision-language datasets and models, using language as a proxy for culture. By comparing textual descriptions generated across 7 languages for the same images, we find significant differences in the semantic content and linguistic expression. When datasets are multilingual as opposed to monolingual, descriptions have higher semantic coverage on average, where coverage is measured using scene graphs, model embeddings, and linguistic taxonomies. For example, multilingual descriptions have on average 29.9% more objects, 24.5% more relations, and 46.0% more attributes than a set of monolingual captions. When prompted to describe images in different languages, popular models (e.g. LLaVA) inherit this bias and describe different parts of the image. Moreover, finetuning models on captions from one language performs best on corresponding test data from that language, while finetuning on multilingual data performs consistently well across all test data compositions. Our work points towards the need to account for and embrace the diversity of human perception in the computer vision community.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Mitigating Image Captioning Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03420v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in vision-language models (VLMs) hinder reliability and real-world applicability, usually stemming from distribution shifts between pretraining data and test samples. Existing solutions, such as retraining or fine-tuning on additional data, demand significant computational resources and labor-intensive data collection, while ensemble-based methods incur additional costs by introducing auxiliary VLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time adaptation framework using reinforcement learning to mitigate hallucinations during inference without retraining or any auxiliary VLMs. By updating only the learnable parameters in the layer normalization of the language model (approximately 0.003% of the model parameters), our method reduces distribution shifts between test samples and pretraining samples. A CLIP-based hallucination evaluation model is proposed to provide dual rewards to VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate a 15.4% and 17.3% reduction in hallucination rates on LLaVA and InstructBLIP, respectively. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a 68.3% improvement in hallucination mitigation, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Leaf Disease Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07019v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leaf disease identification plays a pivotal role in smart agriculture. However, many existing studies still struggle to integrate image and textual modalities to compensate for each other's limitations. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on pretraining with constrained datasets such as ImageNet, which lack domain-specific information. We propose SCOLD (Soft-target COntrastive learning for Leaf Disease identification), a context-aware vision-language foundation model tailored to address these challenges for agricultural tasks. SCOLD is developed using a diverse corpus of plant leaf images and corresponding symptom descriptions, comprising over 186,000 image-caption pairs aligned with 97 unique concepts. Through task-agnostic pretraining, SCOLD leverages contextual soft targets to mitigate overconfidence in contrastive learning by smoothing labels, thereby improving model generalization and robustness on fine-grained classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SCOLD outperforms existing vision-language models such as OpenAI-CLIP-L, BioCLIP, and SigLIP2 across several benchmarks, including zero-shot and few-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and image classification, while maintaining a competitive parameter footprint. Ablation studies further highlight SCOLD's effectiveness in contrast to its counterparts. The proposed approach significantly advances the agricultural vision-language foundation model, offering strong performance with minimal or no supervised fine-tuning. This work lays a solid groundwork for future research on models trained with long-form and simplified contexts, tasks involving class ambiguity, and multi-modal systems for intelligent plant disease diagnostics.

We examine the use of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to assess the likelihood of images and captions. We introduce \textit{Whitened CLIP}, a novel transformation of the CLIP latent space via an invertible linear operation. This transformation ensures that each feature in the embedding space has zero mean, unit standard deviation, and no correlation with all other features, resulting in an identity covariance matrix. We show that the whitened embeddings statistics can be well approximated as a standard normal distribution, thus, the log-likelihood is estimated simply by the square Euclidean norm in the whitened embedding space. The whitening procedure is completely training-free and performed using a pre-computed whitening matrix, hence, is very fast. We present several preliminary experiments demonstrating the properties and applicability of these likelihood scores to images and captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025.

However, existing exploration on model collapse is limited to single, unimodal models, limiting our understanding in more realistic scenarios, such as diverse multi-modal AI agents interacting autonomously through synthetic data and continually evolving. We expand the synthetic data training and model collapse study to multi-modal vision-language generative systems, such as vision-language models (VLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models, as well as recursive generate-train loops with multiple models. We find that model collapse, previously observed in single-modality generative models, exhibits distinct characteristics in the multi-modal context, such as improved vision-language alignment and increased variance in VLM image-captioning task. Additionally, we find that general approaches such as increased decoding budgets, greater model diversity, and relabeling with frozen models can effectively mitigate model collapse. Our findings provide initial insights and practical guidelines for reducing the risk of model collapse in self-improving multi-agent AI systems and curating robust multi-modal synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on general image captioning, they often fail to capture the nuanced interpretations that fine art demands. We propose ArtRAG, a novel, training-free framework that combines structured knowledge with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multi-perspective artwork explanation. ArtRAG automatically constructs an Art Context Knowledge Graph (ACKG) from domain-specific textual sources, organizing entities such as artists, movements, themes, and historical events into a rich, interpretable graph. At inference time, a multi-granular structured retriever selects semantically and topologically relevant subgraphs to guide generation. This enables MLLMs to produce contextually grounded, culturally informed art descriptions. Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG outperforms several heavily trained baselines. Human evaluations further confirm that ArtRAG generates coherent, insightful, and culturally enriched interpretations.</p></details> |  |

In our setting, a speaker attempts to communicate some information to a listener in a single-turn dialogue and receives a reward if communicative success is achieved. Unlike earlier related work using image--caption data for interactive reference games, we operationalize communicative success in a more abstract language-only question--answering setting. First, we present a feasibility study demonstrating that our reward provides an indirect signal about grammaticality. Second, we conduct experiments using reinforcement learning to fine-tune language models. We observe that cognitively plausible constraints on the communication channel lead to interpretable changes in speaker behavior. However, we do not yet see improvements on linguistic evaluations from our training regime. We outline potential modifications to the task design and training configuration that could better position future work to use our methodology to observe the benefits of interaction on language learning in computational cognitive models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Describe Anything in Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05804v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localized image captioning has made significant progress with models like the Describe Anything Model (DAM), which can generate detailed region-specific descriptions without explicit region-text supervision. However, such capabilities have yet to be widely applied to specialized domains like medical imaging, where diagnostic interpretation relies on subtle regional findings rather than global understanding. To mitigate this gap, we propose MedDAM, the first comprehensive framework leveraging large vision-language models for region-specific captioning in medical images. MedDAM employs medical expert-designed prompts tailored to specific imaging modalities and establishes a robust evaluation benchmark comprising a customized assessment protocol, data pre-processing pipeline, and specialized QA template library. This benchmark evaluates both MedDAM and other adaptable large vision-language models, focusing on clinical factuality through attribute-level verification tasks, thereby circumventing the absence of ground-truth region-caption pairs in medical datasets. Extensive experiments on the VinDr-CXR, LIDC-IDRI, and SkinCon datasets demonstrate MedDAM's superiority over leading peers (including GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, LLaMA-3.2 Vision, Qwen2.5-VL, GPT-4Rol, and OMG-LLaVA) in the task, revealing the importance of region-level semantic alignment in medical image understanding and establishing MedDAM as a promising foundation for clinical vision-language integration.</p></details> |  |

It employs a comparative approach to analyze these tasks through the lens of trustworthiness, underlining fairness, explainability, and ethics. This study synthesizes findings from recent literature to identify trends, challenges, and state-of-the-art solutions. Results: Several key findings were highlighted. Transparency: Explainability of vision language tasks is important for user trust. Techniques, such as attention maps and gradient-based methods, have successfully addressed this issue. Fairness: Bias mitigation in VQA and visual dialogue systems is essential for ensuring unbiased outcomes across diverse demographic groups. Ethical Implications: Addressing biases in multilingual models and ensuring ethical data handling is critical for the responsible deployment of vision-language systems. Conclusion: This study underscores the importance of integrating fairness, transparency, and ethical considerations in developing vision-language models within a unified framework.</p></details> |  |

Its effectiveness primarily stems from the use of natural language as rich supervision. Motivated by the remarkable advancements in large language models (LLMs), this work explores how LLMs' superior text understanding and extensive open-world knowledge can enhance CLIP's capability, especially for processing longer and more complex image captions. We propose an efficient post-training strategy that integrates LLMs into pretrained CLIP. To address the challenge posed by the autoregressive nature of LLMs, we introduce a caption-to-caption contrastive fine-tuning framework, significantly enhancing the discriminative quality of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms LoRA-based methods, achieving nearly fourfold faster training with superior performance. Furthermore, we validate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models such as CLIP, EVA02, and SigLip2 across various zero-shot multimodal retrieval tasks, cross-lingual retrieval tasks, and multimodal language model pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Word to Sentence: A Large-Scale Multi-Instance Dataset for Open-Set Aerial Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03334v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, language-guided open-world aerial object detection has gained significant attention due to its better alignment with real-world application needs. However, due to limited datasets, most existing language-guided methods primarily focus on vocabulary, which fails to meet the demands of more fine-grained open-world detection. To address this limitation, we propose constructing a large-scale language-guided open-set aerial detection dataset, encompassing three levels of language guidance: from words to phrases, and ultimately to sentences. Centered around an open-source large vision-language model and integrating image-operation-based preprocessing with BERT-based postprocessing, we present the OS-W2S Label Engine, an automatic annotation pipeline capable of handling diverse scene annotations for aerial images. Using this label engine, we expand existing aerial detection datasets with rich textual annotations and construct a novel benchmark dataset, called Multi-instance Open-set Aerial Dataset (MI-OAD), addressing the limitations of current remote sensing grounding data and enabling effective open-set aerial detection. Specifically, MI-OAD contains 163,023 images and 2 million image-caption pairs, approximately 40 times larger than comparable datasets. We also employ state-of-the-art open-set methods from the natural image domain, trained on our proposed dataset, to validate the model's open-set detection capabilities. For instance, when trained on our dataset, Grounding DINO achieves improvements of 29.5 AP_{50} and 33.7 Recall@10 for sentence inputs under zero-shot transfer conditions. Both the dataset and the label engine will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on critical discourse analysis and sociotechnical theory, the study reveals how AI-driven platforms delegate judgment to algorithmic processes, normalize opacity, and recursively reinforce behavioral norms under the guise of neutrality and optimization. Case studies include generative AI models in classroom surveillance, autonomous targeting in military AI systems, and content curation logics in platform governance. Rather than treating these domains as disparate, the paper maps their structural convergence within recursive architectures of abstraction, surveillance, and classification. These feedback systems do not simply automate tasks -- they encode modes of epistemic authority that disperse accountability while intensifying political asymmetries. Through cultural and policy analysis, the article argues that authoritarian recursion operates as a hybrid logic, fusing technical abstraction with state and market imperatives. The paper concludes by outlining implications for democratic legitimacy, human oversight, and the political design of AI governance frameworks. This framework contributes to emerging debates on algorithmic accountability by foregrounding how recursion acts not merely as a technical function but as a sociopolitical instrument of control.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 1 figure and 1 table</p></details> |

Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element, generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection. Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork, and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner. Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.</p></details> | <details><summary>How A...</summary><p>How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity.

This has made it increasingly popular thanks to its low cost and the availability of libraries that support merging on consumer GPUs. Recent work shows that pairing merging with evolutionary algorithms can boost performance, but no framework currently supports flexible experimentation with such strategies in language models. We introduce Mergenetic, an open-source library for evolutionary model merging. Mergenetic enables easy composition of merging methods and evolutionary algorithms while incorporating lightweight fitness estimators to reduce evaluation costs. We describe its design and demonstrate that Mergenetic produces competitive results across tasks and languages using modest hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Link:...</summary><p>Link: https://github.com/tommasomncttn/mergenetic</p></details> |

In this context, Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are highly attractive due to their theoretically superior energy efficiency due to their inherently sparse activity induced by neurons communicating by means of binary spikes. Nevertheless, the ability of SNN to reach such efficiency on real world tasks is still to be demonstrated in practice. To evaluate the feasibility of utilizing SNN onboard spacecraft, this work presents a numerical analysis and comparison of different SNN techniques applied to scene classification for the EuroSAT dataset. Such tasks are of primary importance for space applications and constitute a valuable test case given the abundance of competitive methods available to establish a benchmark. Particular emphasis is placed on models based on temporal coding, where crucial information is encoded in the timing of neuron spikes. These models promise even greater efficiency of resulting networks, as they maximize the sparsity properties inherent in SNN. A reliable metric capable of comparing different architectures in a hardware-agnostic way is developed to establish a clear theoretical dependence between architecture parameters and the energy consumption that can be expected onboard the spacecraft. The potential of this novel method and his flexibility to describe specific hardware platforms is demonstrated by its application to predicting the energy consumption of a BrainChip Akida AKD1000 neuromorphic processor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty quantification with approximate variational learning for wearable photoplethysmography prediction tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11412v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals encode information about relative changes in blood volume that can be used to assess various aspects of cardiac health non-invasively, e.g.\ to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) or predict blood pressure (BP). Deep networks are well-equipped to handle the large quantities of data acquired from wearable measurement devices. However, they lack interpretability and are prone to overfitting, leaving considerable risk for poor performance on unseen data and misdiagnosis. Here, we describe the use of two scalable uncertainty quantification techniques: Monte Carlo Dropout and the recently proposed Improved Variational Online Newton. These techniques are used to assess the trustworthiness of models trained to perform AF classification and BP regression from raw PPG time series. We find that the choice of hyperparameters has a considerable effect on the predictive performance of the models and on the quality and composition of predicted uncertainties. E.g. the stochasticity of the model parameter sampling determines the proportion of the total uncertainty that is aleatoric, and has varying effects on predictive performance and calibration quality dependent on the chosen uncertainty quantification technique and the chosen expression of uncertainty. We find significant discrepancy in the quality of uncertainties over the predicted classes, emphasising the need for a thorough evaluation protocol that assesses local and adaptive calibration. This work suggests that the choice of hyperparameters must be carefully tuned to balance predictive performance and calibration quality, and that the optimal parameterisation may vary depending on the chosen expression of uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Future is Sparse: Embedding Compression for Scalable Retrieval in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11388v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industry-scale recommender systems face a core challenge: representing entities with high cardinality, such as users or items, using dense embeddings that must be accessible during both training and inference. However, as embedding sizes grow, memory constraints make storage and access increasingly difficult. We describe a lightweight, learnable embedding compression technique that projects dense embeddings into a high-dimensional, sparsely activated space. Designed for retrieval tasks, our method reduces memory requirements while preserving retrieval performance, enabling scalable deployment under strict resource constraints. Our results demonstrate that leveraging sparsity is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of large-scale recommenders. We release our code at https://github.com/recombee/CompresSAE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Closures for Underresolved Partial Differential Equations using Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11308v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) describe phenomena ranging from turbulence and epidemics to quantum mechanics and financial markets. Despite recent advances in computational science, solving such PDEs for real-world applications remains prohibitively expensive because of the necessity of resolving a broad range of spatiotemporal scales. In turn, practitioners often rely on coarse-grained approximations of the original PDEs, trading off accuracy for reduced computational resources. To mitigate the loss of detail inherent in such approximations, closure models are employed to represent unresolved spatiotemporal interactions. We present a framework for developing closure models for PDEs using synthetic data acquired through the method of manufactured solutions. These data are used in conjunction with reinforcement learning to provide closures for coarse-grained PDEs. We illustrate the efficacy of our method using the one-dimensional and two-dimensional Burgers' equations and the two-dimensional advection equation. Moreover, we demonstrate that closure models trained for inhomogeneous PDEs can be effectively generalized to homogeneous PDEs. The results demonstrate the potential for developing accurate and computationally efficient closure models for systems with scarce data.</p></details> |  |

However, ML models often do not perform homogeneously across such populations resulting in subgroups of the population (e.g., sex=female AND marital_status=married) where the model underperforms or, conversely, is particularly accurate. Identifying and describing such subgroups can support practical decisions on which subpopulation a model is safe to deploy or where more training data is required. The potential of identifying and analyzing such subgroups has been recognized, however, an efficient and coherent framework for effective search is missing. Consequently, we introduce SubROC, an open-source, easy-to-use framework based on Exceptional Model Mining for reliably and efficiently finding strengths and weaknesses of classification models in the form of interpretable population subgroups. SubROC incorporates common evaluation measures (ROC and PR AUC), efficient search space pruning for fast exhaustive subgroup search, control for class imbalance, adjustment for redundant patterns, and significance testing. We illustrate the practical benefits of SubROC in case studies as well as in comparative analyses across multiple datasets.</p></details> | 49 pages, 8 figures |

The drawings are coded as tikz files that can easily be manipulated and used in latex documents. Next to plane maps -- a case for which already several programs exist -- the program allows to draw maps of genus at least one inside a fundamental polygon or with non-contractible cycles displayed as disjoint cycles that have to be identified. Several options allow to tailor the output for individual needs -- e.g.\ by forcing some edges to be completely inside the fundamental polygon. In combination with a program embedding graphs, the tool can also be used for graphs that do not already come with an embedding in an orientable surface.</p></details> |  |

While advancements in large language models (LLMs) and embodied intelligence make this goal closer, several challenges persist: the lack of a unified benchmark for more complex robot tasks, limited evaluation methods and metrics, data incompatibility between LLMs and mobile manipulation trajectories. To address these issues, we propose Embodied Mobile Manipulation in Open Environments (EMMOE), a benchmark that requires agents to interpret user instructions and execute long-horizon everyday tasks in continuous space. EMMOE seamlessly integrates high-level and low-level embodied tasks into a unified framework, along with three new metrics for more diverse assessment. Additionally, we collect~\dataset, which features in various task attributes, detailed process annotations, re-plans after failures, and two sub-datasets for LLM training. Furthermore, we design~\model, a sophisticated agent system consists of LLM with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), light weighted navigation and manipulation models, and multiple error detection mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate~\model's performance and evaluations of different models and policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Partitioning of GPU Power among Multi-Instances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17752v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient power management in cloud data centers is essential for reducing costs, enhancing performance, and minimizing environmental impact. GPUs, critical for tasks like machine learning (ML) and GenAI, are major contributors to power consumption. NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology improves GPU utilization by enabling isolated partitions with per-partition resource tracking, facilitating GPU sharing by multiple tenants. However, accurately apportioning GPU power consumption among MIG instances remains challenging due to a lack of hardware support. This paper addresses this challenge by developing software methods to estimate power usage per MIG partition. We analyze NVIDIA GPU utilization metrics and find that light-weight methods with good accuracy can be difficult to construct. We hence explore the use of ML-based power models to enable accurate, partition-level power estimation. Our findings reveal that a single generic offline power model or modeling method is not applicable across diverse workloads, especially with concurrent MIG usage, and that online models constructed using partition-level utilization metrics of workloads under execution can significantly improve accuracy. Using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we demonstrate this approach for accurate partition-level power estimation for workloads including matrix multiplication and Large Language Model inference, contributing to transparent and fair carbon reporting.</p></details> |  |

However, their heavy computation costs and model sizes are usually unacceptable in real-world deployment. Model quantization, an effective weight-lighting technique, has become an indispensable procedure in the whole deployment pipeline. The essence of quantization acceleration is the conversion from continuous floating-point numbers to discrete integer ones, which significantly speeds up the memory I/O and calculation, i.e., addition and multiplication. However, performance degradation also comes with the conversion because of the loss of precision. Therefore, it has become increasingly popular and critical to investigate how to perform the conversion and how to compensate for the information loss. This article surveys the recent five-year progress towards low-bit quantization on DNNs. We discuss and compare the state-of-the-art quantization methods and classify them into 8 main categories and 24 sub-categories according to their core techniques. Furthermore, we shed light on the potential research opportunities in the field of model quantization.

RINS is a particular form of recursive depth that significantly outperforms +55 other variants, including the recent "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM (Liu et al., 2024) and latent recurrent thinking (Geiping et al., 2025). Unlike prior works, we carry out our comparisons on a compute-matched regime, and demonstrate that for a fixed model size and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. More importantly, with light-weight (linear) adapters (comprising <1% of model parameters) and stochastic dropout, RINS offers a no-regret strategy, meaning that RINS-enabled pretraining improves performance in language modeling even when recursive depth is not applied at inference time. This corresponds to improving performance on a training compute-, parameter-, and inference-matched regime, suggesting its potential as a viable component of LLM pretraining!</p></details> |  |

Still, existing deep learning-based methods often require significant computational costs to generate diverse stylized results. Motivated by this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based framework for arbitrary style transfer RLMiniStyler. This framework leverages a unified reinforcement learning policy to iteratively guide the style transfer process by exploring and exploiting stylization feedback, generating smooth sequences of stylized results while achieving model lightweight. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty-aware multi-task learning strategy that automatically adjusts loss weights to adapt to the content and style balance requirements at different training stages, thereby accelerating model convergence. Through a series of experiments across image various resolutions, we have validated the advantages of RLMiniStyler over other state-of-the-art methods in generating high-quality, diverse artistic image sequences at a lower cost.

We utilize a publicly available dataset containing MRI images categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Our primary objective is to build a light weight deep learning model that can automatically classify brain tumor types with high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we incorporate image preprocessing steps, including normalization, data augmentation, and a cropping technique designed to reduce background noise and emphasize relevant regions. The CNN architecture is optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner, enabling systematic exploration of network parameters. To ensure reliable evaluation, we apply 5-fold cross-validation, where each hyperparameter configuration is evaluated across multiple data splits to mitigate overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.78%, indicating its potential as a diagnostic aid in clinical settings. The proposed method offers a low-complexity yet effective solution for assisting in early brain tumor diagnosis.</p></details> | 6 pages |

However, no general solution has yet been found against the unpredictable behavior of neural networks and reinforcement learning agents. Nevertheless, the improvements of photo-realistic simulators have paved the way towards extensive testing of complex algorithms in different virtual scenarios, which would be expensive and dangerous to implement in the real world. This paper presents SimPRIVE, a simulation framework for physical robot interaction with virtual environments, which operates as a vehicle-in-the-loop platform, rendering a virtual world while operating the vehicle in the real world. Using SimPRIVE, any physical mobile robot running on ROS 2 can easily be configured to move its digital twin in a virtual world built with the Unreal Engine 5 graphic engine, which can be populated with objects, people, or other vehicles with programmable behavior. SimPRIVE has been designed to accommodate custom or pre-built virtual worlds while being light-weight to contain execution times and allow fast rendering. Its main advantage lies in the possibility of testing complex algorithms on the full software and hardware stack while minimizing the risks and costs of a test campaign. The framework has been validated by testing a reinforcement learning agent trained for obstacle avoidance on an AgileX Scout Mini rover that navigates a virtual office environment where everyday objects and people are placed as obstacles. The physical rover moves with no collision in an indoor limited space, thanks to a LiDAR-based heuristic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |

However, designing effective and efficient segmentation neural architectures is a labor-intensive process that may require numerous trials by human experts. In this paper, we address the challenge of integrating multi-head self-attention into high-resolution representation CNNs efficiently by leveraging architecture search. Manually replacing convolution layers with multi-head self-attention is non-trivial due to the costly overhead in memory to maintain high resolution. By contrast, we develop a multi-target multi-branch supernet method, which not only fully utilizes the advantages of high-resolution features but also finds the proper location for placing the multi-head self-attention module. Our search algorithm is optimized towards multiple objectives (e.g., latency and mIoU) and is capable of finding architectures on the Pareto frontier with an arbitrary number of branches in a single search. We further present a series of models via the Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search (HyCTAS) method that searches for the best hybrid combination of light-weight convolution layers and memory-efficient self-attention layers between branches from different resolutions and fuses them to high resolution for both efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyCTAS outperforms previous methods in both semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation tasks.

Given a horizontal partition of a table, a provenance sketch for a query Q records which fragments contain provenance. Once a provenance sketch has been captured for a query, it can be used to speed-up subsequent queries by skipping data that does not belong to a sketch. The size and, thus, also the effectiveness of a provenance sketch is often quite sensitive to the choice of attribute(s) we are partitioning on. In this work, we develop sample-based estimation techniques for the size of provenance sketches akin to a specialized form of approximate query processing. This technique enables the online selection of provenance sketches by estimating the size of sketches for a set of candidate attributes and then creating the sketch that is estimated to yield the largest benefit. We demonstrate experimentally that our estimation is accurate enough to select optimal or near optimal provenance sketches in most cases which in turn leads to a runtime improvement of up to %60 compared to other strategies for selecting provenance sketches.</p></details> |  |

Although they generate VMs with high-quality just-in-time (JIT) compilers, they still lack an important feature that dedicated VMs (i.e., VMs that are developed for specific languages) have, namely \emph{multi-tier compilation}. Multi-tier compilation uses light-weight compilers at early stages and highly-optimizing compilers at later stages in order to balance between compilation overheads and code quality. We propose a novel approach to enabling multi-tier compilation in the VMs generated by a meta-compiler framework. Instead of extending the JIT compiler backend of the framework, our approach drives an existing (heavyweight) compiler backend in the framework to quickly generate unoptimized native code by merely embedding directives and compile-time operations into interpreter definitions. As a validation of the approach, we developed 2SOM, a Simple Object Machine with a two-tier JIT compiler based on RPython. 2SOM first applies the tier-1 threaded code generator that is generated by our proposed technique, then, to the loops that exceed a threshold, applies the tier-2 tracing JIT compiler that is generated by the original RPython framework. Our performance evaluation that runs a program with a realistic workload showed that 2SOM improved, when compared against an RPython-based VM, warm-up performance by 15\%, with merely a 5\% reduction in peak performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECOOP...</summary><p>ECOOP 2025.

This work has culminated in an almost complete understanding of the three-way tradeoff between stretch, sparsity, and number of faults tolerated. However, despite some progress in metric settings, there have been no results to date on the tradeoff in general graphs between stretch, lightness, and number of faults tolerated. We initiate the study of light edge fault tolerant (EFT) graph spanners, obtaining the first such results. First, we observe that lightness can be unbounded if we use the traditional definition (normalizing by the MST). We then argue that a natural definition of fault-tolerant lightness is to instead normalize by a min-weight fault tolerant connectivity preserver; essentially, a fault-tolerant version of the MST. However, even with this, we show that it is still not generally possible to construct $f$-EFT spanners whose weight compares reasonably to the weight of a min-weight $f$-EFT connectivity preserver. In light of this lower bound, it is natural to then consider bicriteria notions of lightness, where we compare the weight of an $f$-EFT spanner to a min-weight $(f' > f)$-EFT connectivity preserver. The most interesting question is to determine the minimum value of $f'$ that allows for reasonable lightness upper bounds. Our main result is a precise answer to this question: $f' = 2f$. In particular, we show that the lightness can be untenably large (roughly $n/k$ for a $k$-spanner) if one normalizes by the min-weight $(2f-1)$-EFT connectivity preserver. But if one normalizes by the min-weight $2f$-EFT connectivity preserver, then we show that the lightness is bounded by just $O(f^{1/2})$ times the non-fault tolerant lightness (roughly $n^{1/k}$, for a $(1+\epsilon)(2k-1)$-spanner).</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared at ICALP 2025.

| **[MVQA: Mamba with Unified Sampling for Efficient Video Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16003v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of long-duration, high-definition videos has made efficient video quality assessment (VQA) a critical challenge. Existing research typically tackles this problem through two main strategies: reducing model parameters and resampling inputs. However, light-weight Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformers often struggle to balance efficiency with high performance due to the requirement of long-range modeling capabilities. Recently, the state-space model, particularly Mamba, has emerged as a promising alternative, offering linear complexity with respect to sequence length. Meanwhile, efficient VQA heavily depends on resampling long sequences to minimize computational costs, yet current resampling methods are often weak in preserving essential semantic information. In this work, we present MVQA, a Mamba-based model designed for efficient VQA along with a novel Unified Semantic and Distortion Sampling (USDS) approach. USDS combines semantic patch sampling from low-resolution videos and distortion patch sampling from original-resolution videos. The former captures semantically dense regions, while the latter retains critical distortion details. To prevent computation increase from dual inputs, we propose a fusion mechanism using pre-defined masks, enabling a unified sampling strategy that captures both semantic and quality information without additional computational burden. Experiments show that the proposed MVQA, equipped with USDS, achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while being $2\times$ as fast and requiring only $1/5$ GPU memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Acquire and then Adapt: Squeezing out Text-to-Image Model for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15159v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models have been extensively adopted for real-world image restoration because of their powerful generative prior. However, controlling these large models for image restoration usually requires a large number of high-quality images and immense computational resources for training, which is costly and not privacy-friendly. In this paper, we find that the well-trained large T2I model (i.e., Flux) is able to produce a variety of high-quality images aligned with real-world distributions, offering an unlimited supply of training samples to mitigate the above issue. Specifically, we proposed a training data construction pipeline for image restoration, namely FluxGen, which includes unconditional image generation, image selection, and degraded image simulation. A novel light-weighted adapter (FluxIR) with squeeze-and-excitation layers is also carefully designed to control the large Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based T2I model so that reasonable details can be restored. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method enables the Flux model to adapt effectively to real-world image restoration tasks, achieving superior scores and visual quality on both synthetic and real-world degradation datasets - at only about 8.5\% of the training cost compared to current approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[MoWE-Audio: Multitask AudioLLMs with Mixture of Weak Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06635v4)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced natural language processing capabilities, facilitating the development of AudioLLMs that process and understand speech and audio inputs alongside text. Existing AudioLLMs typically combine a pre-trained audio encoder with a pre-trained LLM, which are subsequently finetuned on specific audio tasks. However, the pre-trained audio encoder has constrained capacity to capture features for new tasks and datasets. To address this, we propose to incorporate mixtures of `weak' encoders (MoWE) into the AudioLLM framework. MoWE supplements a base encoder with a pool of relatively light weight encoders, selectively activated based on the audio input to enhance feature extraction without significantly increasing model size. Our empirical results demonstrate that MoWE effectively improves multi-task performance, broadening the applicability of AudioLLMs to more diverse audio tasks.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 |

| **[Autoencoder-Based Hybrid Replay for Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05926v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In class-incremental learning (CIL), effective incremental learning strategies are essential to mitigate task confusion and catastrophic forgetting, especially as the number of tasks $t$ increases. Current exemplar replay strategies impose $\mathcal{O}(t)$ memory/compute complexities. We propose an autoencoder-based hybrid replay (AHR) strategy that leverages our new hybrid autoencoder (HAE) to function as a compressor to alleviate the requirement for large memory, achieving $\mathcal{O}(0.1 t)$ at the worst case with the computing complexity of $\mathcal{O}(t)$ while accomplishing state-of-the-art performance. The decoder later recovers the exemplar data stored in the latent space, rather than in raw format. Additionally, HAE is designed for both discriminative and generative modeling, enabling classification and replay capabilities, respectively. HAE adopts the charged particle system energy minimization equations and repulsive force algorithm for the incremental embedding and distribution of new class centroids in its latent space. Our results demonstrate that AHR consistently outperforms recent baselines across multiple benchmarks while operating with the same memory/compute budgets. The source code is included in the supplementary material and will be open-sourced upon publication.</p></details> | Accepted ICML 2025 |
| **[A Plasticity-Aware Method for Continual Self-Supervised Learning in Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24088v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) methods have gained increasing attention in remote sensing (RS) due to their capability to learn new tasks sequentially from continuous streams of unlabeled data. Existing CSSL methods, while learning new tasks, focus on preventing catastrophic forgetting. To this end, most of them use regularization strategies to retain knowledge of previous tasks. This reduces the model's ability to adapt to the data of new tasks (i.e., learning plasticity), which can degrade performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel CSSL method that aims to learn tasks sequentially, while achieving high learning plasticity. To this end, the proposed method uses a knowledge distillation strategy with an integrated decoupling mechanism. The decoupling is achieved by first dividing the feature dimensions into task-common and task-specific parts. Then, the task-common features are forced to be correlated to ensure memory stability while the task-specific features are forced to be de-correlated facilitating the learning of new features. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to CaSSLe, which is a widely used CSSL framework, with improvements of up to 1.12% in average accuracy and 2.33% in intransigence in a task-incremental scenario, and 1.24% in average accuracy and 2.01% in intransigence in a class-incremental scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>We fo...</summary><p>We found the reported results of the compared method to be misleading</p></details> |
| **[Completely Weakly Supervised Class-Incremental Learning for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10781v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the task of completely weakly supervised class-incremental learning for semantic segmentation to learn segmentation for both base and additional novel classes using only image-level labels. While class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) is crucial for handling diverse and newly emerging objects in the real world, traditional CISS methods require expensive pixel-level annotations for training. To overcome this limitation, partially weakly-supervised approaches have recently been proposed. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a completely weakly-supervised method for CISS. To achieve this, we propose to generate robust pseudo-labels by combining pseudo-labels from a localizer and a sequence of foundation models based on their uncertainty. Moreover, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce an exemplar-guided data augmentation method that generates diverse images containing both previous and novel classes with guidance. Finally, we conduct experiments in three common experimental settings: 15-5 VOC, 10-10 VOC, and COCO-to-VOC, and in two scenarios: disjoint and overlap. The experimental results demonstrate that our completely weakly supervised method outperforms even partially weakly supervised methods in the 15-5 VOC and 10-10 VOC settings while achieving competitive accuracy in the COCO-to-VOC setting.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Preserving Plasticity in Continual Learning with Adaptive Linearity Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09486v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loss of plasticity in deep neural networks is the gradual reduction in a model's capacity to incrementally learn and has been identified as a key obstacle to learning in non-stationary problem settings. Recent work has shown that deep linear networks tend to be resilient towards loss of plasticity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Adaptive Linearization (AdaLin), a general approach that dynamically adapts each neuron's activation function to mitigate plasticity loss. Unlike prior methods that rely on regularization or periodic resets, AdaLin equips every neuron with a learnable parameter and a gating mechanism that injects linearity into the activation function based on its gradient flow. This adaptive modulation ensures sufficient gradient signal and sustains continual learning without introducing additional hyperparameters or requiring explicit task boundaries. When used with conventional activation functions like ReLU, Tanh, and GeLU, we demonstrate that AdaLin can significantly improve performance on standard benchmarks, including Random Label and Permuted MNIST, Random Label and Shuffled CIFAR-10, and Class-Split CIFAR-100. Furthermore, its efficacy is shown in more complex scenarios, such as class-incremental learning on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-18 backbone, and in mitigating plasticity loss in off-policy reinforcement learning agents. We perform a systematic set of ablations that show that neuron-level adaptation is crucial for good performance and analyze a number of metrics in the network that might be correlated to loss of plasticity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 4th Conference on Lifelong Learning Agents (CoLLAs), 2025</p></details> |
| **[PrePrompt: Predictive prompting for class incremental learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08586v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class Incremental Learning (CIL) based on pre-trained models offers a promising direction for open-world continual learning. Existing methods typically rely on correlation-based strategies, where an image's classification feature is used as a query to retrieve the most related key prompts and select the corresponding value prompts for training. However, these approaches face an inherent limitation: fitting the entire feature space of all tasks with only a few trainable prompts is fundamentally challenging. We propose Predictive Prompting (PrePrompt), a novel CIL framework that circumvents correlation-based limitations by leveraging pre-trained models' natural classification ability to predict task-specific prompts. Specifically, PrePrompt decomposes CIL into a two-stage prediction framework: task-specific prompt prediction followed by label prediction. While theoretically appealing, this framework risks bias toward recent classes due to missing historical data for older classifier calibration. PrePrompt then mitigates this by incorporating feature translation, dynamically balancing stability and plasticity. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate PrePrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art prompt-based CIL methods. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 29 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[GradMix: Gradient-based Selective Mixup for Robust Data Augmentation in Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08528v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of continual learning, acquiring new knowledge while maintaining previous knowledge presents a significant challenge. Existing methods often use experience replay techniques that store a small portion of previous task data for training. In experience replay approaches, data augmentation has emerged as a promising strategy to further improve the model performance by mixing limited previous task data with sufficient current task data. However, we theoretically and empirically analyze that training with mixed samples from random sample pairs may harm the knowledge of previous tasks and cause greater catastrophic forgetting. We then propose GradMix, a robust data augmentation method specifically designed for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning. GradMix performs gradient-based selective mixup using a class-based criterion that mixes only samples from helpful class pairs and not from detrimental class pairs for reducing catastrophic forgetting. Our experiments on various real datasets show that GradMix outperforms data augmentation baselines in accuracy by minimizing the forgetting of previous knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Shift Estimation via Dual-Projection and Classifier Reconstruction for Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05423v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to sequentially learn from distinct categories without retaining exemplars but easily suffers from catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. While existing EFCIL methods leverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two critical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the embeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks, and the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with new data, hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate a classifier reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits previous in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, on various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods. Our codes are available at https://github.com/RHe502/ICML25-DPCR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025; Camera ready version</p></details> |
| **[Low-Complexity Inference in Continual Learning via Compressed Knowledge Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08327v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) aims to train models that can learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. A core challenge in CL is balancing stability -- preserving performance on old tasks -- and plasticity -- adapting to new ones. Recently, large pre-trained models have been widely adopted in CL for their ability to support both, offering strong generalization for new tasks and resilience against forgetting. However, their high computational cost at inference time limits their practicality in real-world applications, especially those requiring low latency or energy efficiency. To address this issue, we explore model compression techniques, including pruning and knowledge distillation (KD), and propose two efficient frameworks tailored for class-incremental learning (CIL), a challenging CL setting where task identities are unavailable during inference. The pruning-based framework includes pre- and post-pruning strategies that apply compression at different training stages. The KD-based framework adopts a teacher-student architecture, where a large pre-trained teacher transfers downstream-relevant knowledge to a compact student. Extensive experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed frameworks achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and inference complexity, consistently outperforming strong baselines. We further analyze the trade-offs between the two frameworks in terms of accuracy and efficiency, offering insights into their use across different scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lifelong Whole Slide Image Analysis: Online Vision-Language Adaptation and Past-to-Present Gradient Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01984v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) play a crucial role in accurate cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as they provide tissue details at the cellular level. However, the rapid growth of computational tasks involving WSIs poses significant challenges. Given that WSIs are gigapixels in size, they present difficulties in terms of storage, processing, and model training. Therefore, it is essential to develop lifelong learning approaches for WSI analysis. In scenarios where slides are distributed across multiple institutes, we aim to leverage them to develop a unified online model as a computational tool for cancer diagnosis in clinical and hospital settings. In this study, we introduce ADaFGrad, a method designed to enhance lifelong learning for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis. First, we leverage pathology vision-language foundation models to develop a framework that enables interaction between a slide's regional tissue features and a predefined text-based prototype buffer. Additionally, we propose a gradient-distillation mechanism that mimics the gradient of a logit with respect to the classification-head parameters across past and current iterations in a continual-learning setting. We construct a sequence of six TCGA datasets for training and evaluation. Experimental results show that ADaFGrad outperforms both state-of-the-art WSI-specific and conventional continual-learning methods after only a few training epochs, exceeding them by up to +5.068% in the class-incremental learning scenario while exhibiting the least forgetting (i.e., retaining the most knowledge from previous tasks). Moreover, ADaFGrad surpasses its baseline by as much as +40.084% in accuracy, further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Additive Parameter Updates of Vision Transformers for Few-Shot Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08982v2)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating new class information without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence, often referred to as catastrophic forgetting. Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) addresses this by first training a model on a robust dataset of base classes and then incrementally adapting it in successive sessions using only a few labeled examples per novel class. However, this approach is prone to overfitting on the limited new data, which can compromise overall performance and exacerbate forgetting. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective novel FSCIL framework that leverages a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone augmented with parameter-efficient additive updates. Our approach freezes the pre-trained ViT parameters and selectively injects trainable weights into the self-attention modules via an additive update mechanism. This design updates only a small subset of parameters to accommodate new classes without sacrificing the representations learned during the base session. By fine-tuning a limited number of parameters, our method preserves the generalizable features in the frozen ViT while reducing the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, as most parameters remain fixed, the model avoids overwriting previously learned knowledge when small novel data batches are introduced. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach yields state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline FSCIL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[SacFL: Self-Adaptive Federated Continual Learning for Resource-Constrained End Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00365v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm, wherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data generated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by continuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device models. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling machine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is unsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this context, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution, preserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative updates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor autonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial tasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and task-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining lightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices. Moreover, $\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an autonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new task has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately allows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without additional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and THUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\rm{SacFL}$ in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios. Furthermore, a demo system has been developed to verify its practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TNNLS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Partitioned Memory Storage Inspired Few-Shot Class-Incremental learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20797v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current mainstream deep learning techniques exhibit an over-reliance on extensive training data and a lack of adaptability to the dynamic world, marking a considerable disparity from human intelligence. To bridge this gap, Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) has emerged, focusing on continuous learning of new categories with limited samples without forgetting old knowledge. Existing FSCIL studies typically use a single model to learn knowledge across all sessions, inevitably leading to the stability-plasticity dilemma. Unlike machines, humans store varied knowledge in different cerebral cortices. Inspired by this characteristic, our paper aims to develop a method that learns independent models for each session. It can inherently prevent catastrophic forgetting. During the testing stage, our method integrates Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for model deployment. Our method provides a fresh viewpoint for FSCIL and demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100 and mini-ImageNet datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inclusive Training Separation and Implicit Knowledge Interaction for Balanced Online Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20566v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online class-incremental learning (OCIL) focuses on gradually learning new classes (called plasticity) from a stream of data in a single-pass, while concurrently preserving knowledge of previously learned classes (called stability). The primary challenge in OCIL lies in maintaining a good balance between the knowledge of old and new classes within the continually updated model. Most existing methods rely on explicit knowledge interaction through experience replay, and often employ exclusive training separation to address bias problems. Nevertheless, it still remains a big challenge to achieve a well-balanced learner, as these methods often exhibit either reduced plasticity or limited stability due to difficulties in continually integrating knowledge in the OCIL setting. In this paper, we propose a novel replay-based method, called Balanced Online Incremental Learning (BOIL), which can achieve both high plasticity and stability, thus ensuring more balanced performance in OCIL. Our BOIL method proposes an inclusive training separation strategy using dual classifiers so that knowledge from both old and new classes can effectively be integrated into the model, while introducing implicit approaches for transferring knowledge across the two classifiers. Extensive experimental evaluations over three widely-used OCIL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of BOIL, showing more balanced yet better performance compared to state-of-the-art replay-based OCIL methods.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Dynamic Integration of Task-Specific Adapters for Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14983v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-exemplar class Incremental Learning (NECIL) enables models to continuously acquire new classes without retraining from scratch and storing old task exemplars, addressing privacy and storage issues. However, the absence of data from earlier tasks exacerbates the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in NECIL. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Integration of task-specific Adapters (DIA), which comprises two key components: Task-Specific Adapter Integration (TSAI) and Patch-Level Model Alignment. TSAI boosts compositionality through a patch-level adapter integration strategy, which provides a more flexible compositional solution while maintaining low computation costs. Patch-Level Model Alignment maintains feature consistency and accurate decision boundaries via two specialized mechanisms: Patch-Level Distillation Loss (PDL) and Patch-Level Feature Reconstruction method (PFR). Specifically, the PDL preserves feature-level consistency between successive models by implementing a distillation loss based on the contributions of patch tokens to new class learning. The PFR facilitates accurate classifier alignment by reconstructing old class features from previous tasks that adapt to new task knowledge. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our DIA, revealing significant improvements on benchmark datasets in the NECIL setting, maintaining an optimal balance between computational complexity and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperparameters in Continual Learning: A Reality Check](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09066v4)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) aims to train a model on a sequence of tasks (i.e., a CL scenario) while balancing the trade-off between plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (retaining prior knowledge). The dominantly adopted conventional evaluation protocol for CL algorithms selects the best hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, mini-batch size, regularization strengths, etc.) within a given scenario and then evaluates the algorithms using these hyperparameters in the same scenario. However, this protocol has significant shortcomings: it overestimates the CL capacity of algorithms and relies on unrealistic hyperparameter tuning, which is not feasible for real-world applications. From the fundamental principles of evaluation in machine learning, we argue that the evaluation of CL algorithms should focus on assessing the generalizability of their CL capacity to unseen scenarios. Based on this, we propose the Generalizable Two-phase Evaluation Protocol (GTEP) consisting of hyperparameter tuning and evaluation phases. Both phases share the same scenario configuration (e.g., number of tasks) but are generated from different datasets. Hyperparameters of CL algorithms are tuned in the first phase and applied in the second phase to evaluate the algorithms. We apply this protocol to class-incremental learning, both with and without pretrained models. Across more than 8,000 experiments, our results show that most state-of-the-art algorithms fail to replicate their reported performance, highlighting that their CL capacity has been significantly overestimated in the conventional evaluation protocol. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/csm9493/GTEP.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |
| **[Enhancing Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning through Neural Collapse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18437v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) is a critical capability for real-world applications, enabling learning systems to adapt to new tasks while retaining knowledge from previous ones. Recent advancements in pre-trained models (PTMs) have significantly advanced the field of CIL, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods. However, understanding how features evolve and are distributed across incremental tasks remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to modeling feature evolution in PTM-based CIL through the lens of neural collapse (NC), a striking phenomenon observed in the final phase of training, which leads to a well-separated, equiangular feature space. We explore the connection between NC and CIL effectiveness, showing that aligning feature distributions with the NC geometry enhances the ability to capture the dynamic behavior of continual learning. Based on this insight, we introduce Neural Collapse-inspired Pre-Trained Model-based CIL (NCPTM-CIL), a method that dynamically adjusts the feature space to conform to the elegant NC structure, thereby enhancing the continual learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCPTM-CIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets. Notably, when initialized with ViT-B/16-IN1K, NCPTM-CIL surpasses the runner-up method by 6.73% on VTAB, 1.25% on CIFAR-100, and 2.5% on OmniBenchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noise-Tolerant Coreset-Based Class Incremental Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16763v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications of computer vision require the ability to adapt to novel data distributions after deployment. Adaptation requires algorithms capable of continual learning (CL). Continual learners must be plastic to adapt to novel tasks while minimizing forgetting of previous tasks.However, CL opens up avenues for noise to enter the training pipeline and disrupt the CL. This work focuses on label noise and instance noise in the context of class-incremental learning (CIL), where new classes are added to a classifier over time, and there is no access to external data from past classes. We aim to understand the sensitivity of CL methods that work by replaying items from a memory constructed using the idea of Coresets. We derive a new bound for the robustness of such a method to uncorrelated instance noise under a general additive noise threat model, revealing several insights. Putting the theory into practice, we create two continual learning algorithms to construct noise-tolerant replay buffers. We empirically compare the effectiveness of prior memory-based continual learners and the proposed algorithms under label and uncorrelated instance noise on five diverse datasets. We show that existing memory-based CL are not robust whereas the proposed methods exhibit significant improvements in maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing forgetting in the noisy CIL setting.</p></details> | Work-in-Progress |
| **[Audio-Visual Class-Incremental Learning for Fish Feeding intensity Assessment in Aquaculture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15171v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fish Feeding Intensity Assessment (FFIA) is crucial in industrial aquaculture management. Recent multi-modal approaches have shown promise in improving FFIA robustness and efficiency. However, these methods face significant challenges when adapting to new fish species or environments due to catastrophic forgetting and the lack of suitable datasets. To address these limitations, we first introduce AV-CIL-FFIA, a new dataset comprising 81,932 labelled audio-visual clips capturing feeding intensities across six different fish species in real aquaculture environments. Then, we pioneer audio-visual class incremental learning (CIL) for FFIA and demonstrate through benchmarking on AV-CIL-FFIA that it significantly outperforms single-modality methods. Existing CIL methods rely heavily on historical data. Exemplar-based approaches store raw samples, creating storage challenges, while exemplar-free methods avoid data storage but struggle to distinguish subtle feeding intensity variations across different fish species. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HAIL-FFIA, a novel audio-visual class-incremental learning framework that bridges this gap with a prototype-based approach that achieves exemplar-free efficiency while preserving essential knowledge through compact feature representations. Specifically, HAIL-FFIA employs hierarchical representation learning with a dual-path knowledge preservation mechanism that separates general intensity knowledge from fish-specific characteristics. Additionally, it features a dynamic modality balancing system that adaptively adjusts the importance of audio versus visual information based on feeding behaviour stages. Experimental results show that HAIL-FFIA is superior to SOTA methods on AV-CIL-FFIA, achieving higher accuracy with lower storage needs while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting in incremental fish species learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-parametric Memory Consolidation: Towards Brain-like Deep Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14727v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans and most animals inherently possess a distinctive capacity to continually acquire novel experiences and accumulate worldly knowledge over time. This ability, termed continual learning, is also critical for deep neural networks (DNNs) to adapt to the dynamically evolving world in open environments. However, DNNs notoriously suffer from catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge when trained on sequential tasks. In this work, inspired by the interactive human memory and learning system, we propose a novel biomimetic continual learning framework that integrates semi-parametric memory and the wake-sleep consolidation mechanism. For the first time, our method enables deep neural networks to retain high performance on novel tasks while maintaining prior knowledge in real-world challenging continual learning scenarios, e.g., class-incremental learning on ImageNet. This study demonstrates that emulating biological intelligence provides a promising path to enable deep neural networks with continual learning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEGA: Second-Order Gradient Alignment for Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation in GFSCIL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13691v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (GFSCIL) enables models to continually learn from limited samples of novel tasks after initial training on a large base dataset. Existing GFSCIL approaches typically utilize Prototypical Networks (PNs) for metric-based class representations and fine-tune the model during the incremental learning stage. However, these PN-based methods oversimplify learning via novel query set fine-tuning and fail to integrate Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques due to architectural constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a more rigorous and practical setting for GFSCIL that excludes query sets during the incremental training phase. Building on this foundation, we introduce Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning (MEGA), aimed at effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting for GFSCIL. Specifically, by calculating the incremental second-order gradient during the meta-training stage, we endow the model to learn high-quality priors that enhance incremental learning by aligning its behaviors across both the meta-training and incremental learning stages. Extensive experiments on four mainstream graph datasets demonstrate that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art results and enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in GFSCIL. We believe that our proposed MEGA serves as a model-agnostic GFSCIL paradigm, paving the way for future research.</p></details> | Under Review |
