| **[PlantDeBERTa: An Open Source Language Model for Plant Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08897v4)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of transformer-based language models has catalyzed breakthroughs in biomedical and clinical natural language processing; however, plant science remains markedly underserved by such domain-adapted tools. In this work, we present PlantDeBERTa, a high-performance, open-source language model specifically tailored for extracting structured knowledge from plant stress-response literature. Built upon the DeBERTa architecture-known for its disentangled attention and robust contextual encoding-PlantDeBERTa is fine-tuned on a meticulously curated corpus of expert-annotated abstracts, with a primary focus on lentil (Lens culinaris) responses to diverse abiotic and biotic stressors. Our methodology combines transformer-based modeling with rule-enhanced linguistic post-processing and ontology-grounded entity normalization, enabling PlantDeBERTa to capture biologically meaningful relationships with precision and semantic fidelity. The underlying corpus is annotated using a hierarchical schema aligned with the Crop Ontology, encompassing molecular, physiological, biochemical, and agronomic dimensions of plant adaptation. PlantDeBERTa exhibits strong generalization capabilities across entity types and demonstrates the feasibility of robust domain adaptation in low-resource scientific fields.By providing a scalable and reproducible framework for high-resolution entity recognition, PlantDeBERTa bridges a critical gap in agricultural NLP and paves the way for intelligent, data-driven systems in plant genomics, phenomics, and agronomic knowledge discovery. Our model is publicly released to promote transparency and accelerate cross-disciplinary innovation in computational plant science.</p></details> |  |

This perspective traces the evolution of single-molecule tracking, highlighting key developments across various methodological branches within fluorescence microscopy. We compare the strengths and limitations of each approach, ranging from conventional widefield offline tracking to real-time confocal tracking. In the final section, we explore emerging efforts to advance physics-inspired tracking techniques, a possibility for parallelization and artificial intelligence, and discuss challenges and opportunities they present toward achieving higher spatiotemporal resolution and greater computational and data efficiency in next-generation single-molecule studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAMMPS-KOKKOS: Performance Portable Molecular Dynamics Across Exascale Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13523v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since its inception in 1995, LAMMPS has grown to be a world-class molecular dynamics code, with thousands of users, over one million lines of code, and multi-scale simulation capabilities. We discuss how LAMMPS has adapted to the modern heterogeneous computing landscape by integrating the Kokkos performance portability library into the existing C++ code. We investigate performance portability of simple pairwise, many-body reactive, and machine-learned force-field interatomic potentials. We present results on GPUs across different vendors and generations, and analyze performance trends, probing FLOPS throughput, memory bandwidths, cache capabilities, and thread-atomic operation performance. Finally, we demonstrate strong scaling on all current US exascale machines -- OLCF Frontier, and ALCF Aurora, and NNSA El Capitan -- for the three potentials.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[NovoMolGen: Rethinking Molecular Language Model Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13408v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$ possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations, Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules. However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies, model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5 billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.</p></details> |  |

| **[FlowMol3: Flow Matching for 3D De Novo Small-Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12629v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A generative model capable of sampling realistic molecules with desired properties could accelerate chemical discovery across a wide range of applications. Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing models that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present FlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the state of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial performance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes to the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching formulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three architecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost: self-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3 achieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit hydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and geometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer learnable parameters than comparable methods. We hypothesize that these techniques mitigate a general pathology affecting transport-based generative models, enabling detection and correction of distribution drift during inference. Our results highlight simple, transferable strategies for improving the stability and quality of diffusion- and flow-based molecular generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controlled Generation with Equivariant Variational Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18340v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models, or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Flow Matching for Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04843v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a formulation of flow matching as variational inference, which we refer to as variational flow matching (VFM). Based on this formulation we develop CatFlow, a flow matching method for categorical data. CatFlow is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and achieves strong results on graph generation tasks. In VFM, the objective is to approximate the posterior probability path, which is a distribution over possible end points of a trajectory. We show that VFM admits both the CatFlow objective and the original flow matching objective as special cases. We also relate VFM to score-based models, in which the dynamics are stochastic rather than deterministic, and derive a bound on the model likelihood based on a reweighted VFM objective. We evaluate CatFlow on one abstract graph generation task and two molecular generation tasks. In all cases, CatFlow exceeds or matches performance of the current state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[IBEX: Information-Bottleneck-EXplored Coarse-to-Fine Molecular Generation under Limited Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10775v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design. Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to 64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus 3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation error.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Chem3DLLM: 3D Multimodal Large Language Models for Chemistry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10696v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the real world, a molecule is a 3D geometric structure. Compared to 1D SMILES sequences and 2D molecular graphs, 3D molecules represent the most informative molecular modality. Despite the rapid progress of autoregressive-based language models, they cannot handle the generation of 3D molecular conformation due to several challenges: 1) 3D molecular structures are incompatible with LLMs' discrete token space, 2) integrating heterogeneous inputs like proteins, ligands, and text remains difficult within a unified model, and 3) LLMs lack essential scientific priors, hindering the enforcement of physical and chemical constraints during generation. To tackle these issues, we present Chem3DLLM, a unified protein-conditioned multimodal large language model. Our approach designs a novel reversible text encoding for 3D molecular structures using run-length compression, achieving 3x size reduction while preserving complete structural information. This enables seamless integration of molecular geometry with protein pocket features in a single LLM architecture. We employ reinforcement learning with stability-based rewards to optimize chemical validity and incorporate a lightweight protein embedding projector for end-to-end training. Experimental results on structure-based drug design demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with a Vina score of -7.21, validating our unified multimodal approach for practical drug discovery applications.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[$\text{M}^{2}$LLM: Multi-view Molecular Representation Learning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08657v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery. Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that $\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced reasoning processes.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |
| **[A DNN Biophysics Model with Topological and Electrostatic Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03658v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this project, we provide a deep-learning neural network (DNN) based biophysics model to predict protein properties. The model uses multi-scale and uniform topological and electrostatic features generated with protein structural information and force field, which governs the molecular mechanics. The topological features are generated using the element specified persistent homology (ESPH) while the electrostatic features are fast computed using a Cartesian treecode. These features are uniform in number for proteins with various sizes thus the broadly available protein structure database can be used in training the network. These features are also multi-scale thus the resolution and computational cost can be balanced by the users. The machine learning simulation on over 4000 protein structures shows the efficiency and fidelity of these features in representing the protein structure and force field for the predication of their biophysical properties such as electrostatic solvation energy. Tests on topological or electrostatic features alone and the combination of both showed the optimal performance when both features are used. This model shows its potential as a general tool in assisting biophysical properties and function prediction for the broad biomolecules using data from both theoretical computing and experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolSnap: Snap-Fast Molecular Generation with Latent Variational Mean Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05411v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation. Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over diffusion-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Small Step with Fingerprints, One Giant Leap for De Novo Molecule Generation from Mass Spectra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04180v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common approach to the de novo molecular generation problem from mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into molecular structures. In our work, we adopt MIST as the encoder and MolForge as the decoder, leveraging pretraining to enhance performance. Notably, pretraining MolForge proves especially effective, enabling it to serve as a robust fingerprint-to-structure decoder. Additionally, instead of passing the probability of each bit in the fingerprint, thresholding the probabilities as a step function helps focus the decoder on the presence of substructures, improving recovery of accurate molecular structures even when the fingerprints predicted by MIST only moderately resembles the ground truth in terms of Tanimoto similarity. This combination of encoder and decoder results in a tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1 28% / top-10 36% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra. We position this pipeline as a strong baseline for future research in de novo molecule elucidation from mass spectra.</p></details> |  |
| **[Potential Score Matching: Debiasing Molecular Structure Sampling with Potential Energy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14569v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolReasoner: Toward Effective and Interpretable Reasoning for Molecular LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02066v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics, while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT) samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently, Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions, thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP), a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers. We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature, our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with lower computational cost (without ensemble). While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We will share ReviewGraph output and platform open-sourced on our GitHub page https://github.com/aaronlifenghan/ReviewGraph</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Up without Fading Out: Goal-Aware Sparse GNN for RL-based Generalized Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10747v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow, especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale generalized planning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refining Contrastive Learning and Homography Relations for Multi-Modal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13745v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal recommender system focuses on utilizing rich modal information ( i.e., images and textual descriptions) of items to improve recommendation performance. The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the powerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these methods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although contrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to address the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main limitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective representations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable information in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the homograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in incomplete mining of user-item interplay. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for \textbf{R}\textbf{E}fining multi-mod\textbf{A}l cont\textbf{R}astive learning and ho\textbf{M}ography relations (\textbf{REARM}). Specifically, we complement multi-modal contrastive learning by employing meta-network and orthogonal constraint strategies, which filter out noise in modal-shared features and retain recommendation-relevant information in modal-unique features. To mine homogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user interest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user co-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning. The extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of REARM to various state-of-the-art baselines. Our visualization further shows an improvement made by REARM in distinguishing between modal-shared and modal-unique features.

| **[CaPGNN: Optimizing Parallel Graph Neural Network Training with Joint Caching and Resource-Aware Graph Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13716v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable capabilities in processing graph-structured data prevalent in various real-world applications. However, the scalability of full-batch GNN training becomes severely limited by high communication overhead and load imbalance in distributed environments. In this paper, we present CaPGNN, a novel framework for efficient parallel full-batch GNN training on single-server with multi-GPU, designed specifically to reduce redundant inter-GPU communication and balance computational workloads. We propose a joint adaptive caching algorithm that leverages both CPU and GPU memory to significantly reduce the repetitive transmission of vertex features across partitions. Additionally, we introduce a resource-aware graph partitioning algorithm that adjusts subgraph sizes dynamically according to the heterogeneous computational and communication capacities of GPUs. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that CaPGNN effectively reduces communication costs by up to 96% and accelerates GNN training by up to 12.7 times compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive caching and resource-aware partitioning to facilitate scalable, efficient, and practical deployment of full-batch GNN training in distributed computing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[SVDformer: Direction-Aware Spectral Graph Embedding Learning via SVD and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13435v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOOP: A Plug-and-Play Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Enhancing Planning in Autonomous Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13371v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains, producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships, multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical real-world applications.</p></details> | Submitted to IAAI-26 |

Given a hierarchical representation of the environment, the objective is to navigate from a start position to a goal, while satisfying task-specific safety constraints and minimizing computational cost. We introduce Hierarchical Class-ordered A* (HCOA*), an algorithm that leverages the environment's hierarchy for efficient and safe path-planning in mixed geometric/semantic graphs. We use a total order over the semantic classes and prove theoretical performance guarantees for the algorithm. We propose three approaches for higher-layer node classification based on the semantics of the lowest layer: a Graph Neural Network method, a k-Nearest Neighbors method, and a Majority-Class method. We evaluate HCOA* in simulations on two 3D Scene Graphs, comparing it to the state-of-the-art and assessing the performance of each classification approach. Results show that HCOA* reduces the computational time of navigation by up to 50%, while maintaining near-optimal performance across a wide range of scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines.

Existing defenses mitigate these attacks by manipulating probe delays to mislead inference, but rely on two strong assumptions: (i) probe packets can be perfectly detected and altered, and (ii) attackers use known, fixed inference algorithms. These assumptions often break in practice, leading to degraded defense performance under detection errors or adaptive adversaries. We present RoTO, a robust topology obfuscation scheme that eliminates both assumptions by modeling uncertainty in attacker-observed delays through a distributional formulation. RoTO casts the defense objective as a min-max optimization problem that maximizes expected topological distortion across this uncertainty set, without relying on perfect probe control or specific attacker models. To approximate attacker behavior, RoTO leverages graph neural networks for inference simulation and adversarial training. We also derive an upper bound on attacker success probability, and demonstrate that our approach enhances topology obfuscation performance through the optimization of this upper bound. Experimental results show that RoTO outperforms existing defense methods, achieving average improvements of 34% in structural similarity and 42.6% in link distance while maintaining strong robustness and concealment capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12840v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing significant improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17064v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (main text), 4 figures, 2 tables.

These models feature uniqueness in efficient computation as well as rich expressiveness, which stems from advanced management and profound understanding of graph data. However, few systematic studies have been conducted to assess spectral GNNs, particularly in benchmarking their efficiency, memory consumption, and effectiveness in a unified and fair manner. There is also a pressing need to select spectral models suitable for learning specific graph data and deploying them to massive web-scale graphs, which is currently constrained by the varied model designs and training settings. In this work, we extensively benchmark spectral GNNs with a focus on the spectral perspective, demystifying them as spectral graph filters. We analyze and categorize 35 GNNs with 27 corresponding filters, spanning diverse formulations and utilizations of the graph data. Then, we implement the filters within a unified spectral-oriented framework with dedicated graph computations and efficient training schemes. In particular, our implementation enables the deployment of spectral GNNs over million-scale graphs and various tasks with comparable performance and less overhead. Thorough experiments are conducted on the graph filters with comprehensive metrics on effectiveness and efficiency, offering novel observations and practical guidelines that are only available from our evaluations across graph scales. Different from the prevailing belief, our benchmark reveals an intricate landscape regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of spectral graph filters, demonstrating the potential to achieve desirable performance through tailored spectral manipulation of graph data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full Technical Report.

Current research addresses subgraph-FL from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the semantic knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drift occurs, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate the challenge of poor semantic knowledge caused by label signal disruption. Furthermore, we design a frequency alignment to address spectral client drift. The combination of Spatial and Spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[MPOCryptoML: Multi-Pattern based Off-Chain Crypto Money Laundering Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12641v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in money laundering detection have demonstrated the potential of using graph neural networks to capture laundering patterns accurately. However, existing models are not explicitly designed to detect the diverse patterns of off-chain cryptocurrency money laundering. Neglecting any laundering pattern introduces critical detection gaps, as each pattern reflects unique transactional structures that facilitate the obfuscation of illicit fund origins and movements. Failure to account for these patterns may result in under-detection or omission of specific laundering activities, diminishing model accuracy and allowing schemes to bypass detection. To address this gap, we propose the MPOCryptoML model to effectively detect multiple laundering patterns in cryptocurrency transactions. MPOCryptoML includes the development of a multi-source Personalized PageRank algorithm to identify random laundering patterns. Additionally, we introduce two novel algorithms by analyzing the timestamp and weight of transactions in high-volume financial networks to detect various money laundering structures, including fan-in, fan-out, bipartite, gather-scatter, and stack patterns. We further examine correlations between these patterns using a logistic regression model. An anomaly score function integrates results from each module to rank accounts by anomaly score, systematically identifying high-risk accounts. Extensive experiments on public datasets including Elliptic++, Ethereum fraud detection, and Wormhole transaction datasets validate the efficacy and efficiency of MPOCryptoML. Results show consistent performance gains, with improvements up to 9.13% in precision, up to 10.16% in recall, up to 7.63% in F1-score, and up to 10.19% in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing models that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present FlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the state of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial performance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes to the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching formulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three architecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost: self-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3 achieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit hydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and geometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer learnable parameters than comparable methods. We hypothesize that these techniques mitigate a general pathology affecting transport-based generative models, enabling detection and correction of distribution drift during inference. Our results highlight simple, transferable strategies for improving the stability and quality of diffusion- and flow-based molecular generative models.</p></details> |  |

Central to this effort is the development of invariant and equivariant operations. This works presents a systematic method for constructing valid invariant and equivariant operations. It can handle inputs and outputs in the form of Cartesian tensors with different rank, as well as spherical tensors with different types. In addition, our method features a graphical representation utilizing the symmetric tensor network, which simplifies both the proofs and constructions related to invariant and equivariant functions. We also apply this approach to design the equivariant interaction message for the geometry graph neural network, and equivariant machine learning model to learn the constitutive law of materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Consumer-Grade Cybersickness Prediction: Multi-Model Alignment for Real-Time Vision-Only Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01212v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cybersickness remains a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of immersive virtual reality (VR), particularly in consumer-grade environments. While prior methods rely on invasive signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) for high predictive accuracy, these approaches require specialized hardware and are impractical for real-world applications. In this work, we propose a scalable, deployable framework for personalized cybersickness prediction leveraging only non-invasive signals readily available from commercial VR headsets, including head motion, eye tracking, and physiological responses. Our model employs a modality-specific graph neural network enhanced with a Difference Attention Module to extract temporal-spatial embeddings capturing dynamic changes across modalities. A cross-modal alignment module jointly trains the video encoder to learn personalized traits by aligning video features with sensor-derived representations. Consequently, the model accurately predicts individual cybersickness using only video input during inference. Experimental results show our model achieves 88.4\% accuracy, closely matching EEG-based approaches (89.16\%), while reducing deployment complexity. With an average inference latency of 90ms, our framework supports real-time applications, ideal for integration into consumer-grade VR platforms without compromising personalization or performance.

| **[SGPT: Few-Shot Prompt Tuning for Signed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12155v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are effective in learning expressive representations for signed graphs but typically require substantial task-specific labels, limiting their applicability in label-scarce industrial scenarios. In contrast, unsigned graph structures are abundant and can be readily leveraged to pre-train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offering a promising solution to reduce supervision requirements in downstream signed graph tasks. However, transferring knowledge from unsigned to signed graphs is non-trivial due to the fundamental discrepancies in graph types and task objectives between pre-training and downstream phases. To address this challenge, we propose Signed Graph Prompt Tuning (SGPT), a novel graph prompting framework that adapts pre-trained unsigned GNNs to few-shot signed graph tasks. We first design a graph template based on balance theory to disentangle mixed node relationships introduced by negative links, mitigating the structural mismatches between unsigned and signed graphs. We further introduce a task template that reformulates downstream signed tasks into a unified link prediction objective, aligning their optimization goals with the pre-training task. Furthermore, we develop feature prompts that align downstream semantic spaces with the feature spaces learned during pre-training, and semantic prompts to integrate link sign semantics in a task-aware manner. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmark signed graph datasets, demonstrating that SGPT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, establishing a powerful and generalizable solution for few-shot signed graph learning.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |

However, current methods often rely on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits. First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video (I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our key innovation is using a spatiotemporal mask to strategically guide the LoRA fine-tuning process. This teaches the model two distinct skills: first, to interpret the mask as a command to either preserve content from the source video or generate new content in designated regions. Second, for these generated regions, LoRA learns to synthesize either temporally consistent motion inherited from the video or novel appearances guided by user-provided reference frames. This dual-capability LoRA grants users control over the edit's entire temporal evolution, allowing complex transformations like an object rotating or a flower blooming. Experimental results show our method achieves superior video editing performance compared to baseline methods. Project Page: https://cjeen.github.io/LoRAEdit</p></details> | 9 pages |

By leveraging the strong dynamic priors captured by large-scale pre-trained video models, Geo4D can be trained using only synthetic data while generalizing well to real data in a zero-shot manner. Geo4D predicts several complementary geometric modalities, namely point, disparity, and ray maps. We propose a new multi-modal alignment algorithm to align and fuse these modalities, as well as a sliding window approach at inference time, thus enabling robust and accurate 4D reconstruction of long videos. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Geo4D significantly surpasses state-of-the-art video depth estimation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, ICCV 2025 Highlight, Project page: https://geo4d.github.io/</p></details> |

However, large-scale analysis of data from such studies is hampered by the labor-intensive process of annotating fiber bundles manually on histological slides. Existing automated methods often miss sparse bundles or require complex post-processing across consecutive sections, limiting their flexibility and generalizability. We present a streamlined, fully automated framework for fiber bundle segmentation in macaque tracer data, based on a U-Net architecture with large patch sizes, foreground aware sampling, and semisupervised pre-training. Our approach eliminates common errors such as mislabeling terminals as bundles, improves detection of sparse bundles by over 20% and reduces the False Discovery Rate (FDR) by 40% compared to the state-of-the-art, all while enabling analysis of standalone slices. This new framework will facilitate the automated analysis of anatomic tracing data at a large scale, generating more ground-truth data that can be used to validate and optimize dMRI tractography methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CDMRI, MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

Our key insight is to adapt a 2D diffusion model, which is trained on web-scale images, to generate consistent multi-view color (RGB) and depth (D) images across different locations of the scene. Specifically, the RGB-D images are generated autoregressively in a batch-wise manner along sampled locations based on the floorplan, where previously generated images are used as condition to the diffusion model to produce images at nearby locations. The global floorplan and attention design in the diffusion model ensures the consistency of the generated images, from which a 3D scene can be reconstructed. Through extensive evaluation on the 3D-Front dataset, we demonstrate that HouseCraft can generate high-quality house-scale 3D scenes. Ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of different design choices. We will release our code and model weights. Project page: https://neu-vi.github.io/houseCrafter/</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a general diffusion-based information quality assessment model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13927v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid and unregulated dissemination of information in the digital era has amplified the global "infodemic," complicating the identification of high quality information. We present a lightweight, interpretable and non-invasive framework for assessing information quality based solely on diffusion dynamics, demonstrated here in the context of academic publications. Using a heterogeneous dataset of 29,264 sciences, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) and social science papers from ArnetMiner and OpenAlex, we model the diffusion network of each paper as a set of three theoretically motivated features: diversity, timeliness, and salience. A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) trained on these features achieved Pearson correlations of 0.8468 for next-year citation gain and up to 97.8% accuracy in predicting high-impact papers. Feature relevance studies reveal timeliness and salience as the most robust predictors, while diversity offers less stable benefits in the academic setting but may be more informative in social media contexts. The framework's transparency, domain-agnostic design, and minimal feature requirements position it as a scalable tool for global information quality assessment, opening new avenues for moving beyond binary credibility labels toward richer, diffusion-informed evaluation metrics.</p></details> | 24 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Revisiting Diffusion Q-Learning: From Iterative Denoising to One-Step Action Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13904v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning (RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time compared to DQL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Driven High-Dimensional Variable Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13890v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variable selection for high-dimensional, highly correlated data has long been a challenging problem, often yielding unstable and unreliable models. We propose a resample-aggregate framework that exploits diffusion models' ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic data. Specifically, we draw multiple pseudo-data sets from a diffusion model fitted to the original data, apply any off-the-shelf selector (e.g., lasso or SCAD), and store the resulting inclusion indicators and coefficients. Aggregating across replicas produces a stable subset of predictors with calibrated stability scores for variable selection. Theoretically, we show that the proposed method is selection consistent under mild assumptions. Because the generative model imports knowledge from large pre-trained weights, the procedure naturally benefits from transfer learning, boosting power when the observed sample is small or noisy. We also extend the framework of aggregating synthetic data to other model selection problems, including graphical model selection, and statistical inference that supports valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. Extensive simulations show consistent gains over the lasso, stability selection, and knockoff baselines, especially when predictors are strongly correlated, achieving higher true-positive rates and lower false-discovery proportions. By coupling diffusion-based data augmentation with principled aggregation, our method advances variable selection methodology and broadens the toolkit for interpretable, statistically rigorous analysis in complex scientific applications.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities -- such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/grimalPaul/gsn-factory.</p></details> |  |

However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)\textit{The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the dependencies in the time series data effectively.} To address the first challenge, we explore the potential of state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denoising module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for time series data modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple real-world datasets.

Accurate 3D reconstruction from these sparse slices is essential for comprehensive cardiac assessment, but existing methods face challenges, including reliance on predefined interpolation schemes (e.g., linear or spherical), computational inefficiency, and dependence on additional semantic inputs such as segmentation labels or motion data. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{Ca}rdiac \textbf{L}atent \textbf{I}nterpolation \textbf{D}iffusion (CaLID) framework that introduces three key innovations. First, we present a data-driven interpolation scheme based on diffusion models, which can capture complex, non-linear relationships between sparse slices and improves reconstruction accuracy. Second, we design a computationally efficient method that operates in the latent space and speeds up 3D whole-heart upsampling time by a factor of 24, reducing computational overhead compared to previous methods. Third, with only sparse 2D CMR images as input, our method achieves SOTA performance against baseline methods, eliminating the need for auxiliary input such as morphological guidance, thus simplifying workflows. We further extend our method to 2D+T data, enabling the effective modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring temporal coherence. Extensive volumetric evaluations and downstream segmentation tasks demonstrate that CaLID achieves superior reconstruction quality and efficiency. By addressing the fundamental limitations of existing approaches, our framework advances the state of the art for spatio and spatiotemporal whole-heart reconstruction, offering a robust and clinically practical solution for cardiovascular imaging.</p></details> |  |

However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code: http://http://geometrylearning.com/Sketch3DVE/</p></details> | SIGGRAPH 2025 |

This enables precise control over both the content and temporal structure of the generated audio. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face inherent trade-offs among accurate temporal localization, open-vocabulary scalability, and practical efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose DegDiT, a novel dynamic event graph-guided diffusion transformer framework for open-vocabulary controllable audio generation. DegDiT encodes the events in the description as structured dynamic graphs. The nodes in each graph are designed to represent three aspects: semantic features, temporal attributes, and inter-event connections. A graph transformer is employed to integrate these nodes and produce contextualized event embeddings that serve as guidance for the diffusion model. To ensure high-quality and diverse training data, we introduce a quality-balanced data selection pipeline that combines hierarchical event annotation with multi-criteria quality scoring, resulting in a curated dataset with semantic diversity. Furthermore, we present consensus preference optimization, facilitating audio generation through consensus among multiple reward signals. Extensive experiments on AudioCondition, DESED, and AudioTime datasets demonstrate that DegDiT achieves state-of-the-art performances across a variety of objective and subjective evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, its reliance on contrast agents introduces safety concerns, contraindications, increased cost, and workflow complexity. To this end, we present pre-contrast conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic models to synthesize DCE-MRI, introducing, evaluating, and comparing a total of 22 generative model variants in both single-breast and full breast settings. Towards enhancing lesion fidelity, we introduce both tumor-aware loss functions and explicit tumor segmentation mask conditioning. Using a public multicenter dataset and comparing to respective pre-contrast baselines, we observe that subtraction image-based models consistently outperform post-contrast-based models across five complementary evaluation metrics. Apart from assessing the entire image, we also separately evaluate the region of interest, where both tumor-aware losses and segmentation mask inputs improve evaluation metrics. The latter notably enhance qualitative results capturing contrast uptake, albeit assuming access to tumor localization inputs that are not guaranteed to be available in screening settings. A reader study involving 2 radiologists and 4 MRI technologists confirms the high realism of the synthetic images, indicating an emerging clinical potential of generative contrast-enhancement.

However, these methods involve a workflow of converting vector data into raster images, using image-based generative models, and then converting the results back into vector data. This process is complex and redundant, often resulting in information loss. Raster images, unlike vector data, cannot scale without losing detail and precision. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep learning framework called DiffPlanner for boundary-constrained floor plan generation, which operates entirely in vector space. Our framework is a Transformer-based conditional diffusion model that integrates an alignment mechanism in training, aligning the optimization trajectory of the model with the iterative design processes of designers. This enables our model to handle complex vector data, better fit the distribution of the predicted targets, accomplish the challenging task of floor plan layout design, and achieve user-controllable generation. We conduct quantitative comparisons, qualitative evaluations, ablation experiments, and perceptual studies to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffPlanner surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in generating floor plans and bubble diagrams in the creative stages, offering more controllability to users and producing higher-quality results that closely match the ground truths.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics</p></details> |

| **[UAV-VL-R1: Generalizing Vision-Language Models via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Multi-Stage GRPO for UAV Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11196v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints. These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting, transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marmot: Object-Level Self-Correction via Multi-Agent Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20054v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential solution involves employing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to construct a self-correction framework. However, these approaches heavily rely on the capabilities of the MLLMs used, often fail to account for all objects within the image, and suffer from cumulative distortions during multi-round editing processes. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting to enhance image-text alignment. First, we employ a large language model as an Object-Aware Agent to perform object-level divide-and-conquer, automatically decomposing self-correction tasks into object-centric subtasks based on image descriptions. For each subtask, we construct an Object Correction System featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism that operates exclusively on a single object's segmentation mask or the bounding boxes of object pairs, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To efficiently integrate correction results from subtasks while avoiding cumulative distortions from multi-stage editing, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother, which employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtasks, significantly improving runtime efficiency while preventing distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CountCluster: Training-Free Object Quantity Guidance with Cross-Attention Map Clustering for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10710v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose \textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at: https://github.com/JoohyeonL22/CountCluster .</p></details> | Under review |

The deployment of a SNN usually requires partitioning the network and mapping these partitions onto the hardware's processing units. However, finding optimal deployment configurations is an NP-hard problem, often addressed through optimization algorithms. While some objectives (e.g., memory utilization and chip count) are static, others (e.g., communication latency and energy efficiency) depend on the network's dynamic behavior, necessitating dynamic-aware optimization. To address this, we model SNN dynamics using an Ising-type pairwise interaction framework, bridging microscopic neuron interactions with macroscopic network behavior. We optimize deployment by exploring the parameter and configuration spaces of the Ising model. We evaluate our approach on two SNNs deployed on the sPyNNaker neuromorphic platform. Initial results suggest that the method underperforms, potentially due to the Ising model's equilibrium assumptions and the architectural complexity of real-world neuromorphic hardware, highlighting limitations in its current formulation. Update: The method proposed is with a equilibrium-dynamics SNN assumption, and the original paper does not mention this. The paper needs to be revisited and reuploaded after further experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need further experiments for conclusive results</p></details> |

| **[CAPTURe: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Occluded Object Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15485v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty in counting in images.

| **[Rational Inverse Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08983v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can observe a single, imperfect demonstration and immediately generalize to very different problem settings. Robots, in contrast, often require hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the training conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to recover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that these explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of high-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this work, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring these latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR frames few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language model iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a planner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the observed demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over concise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous manipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across variations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one demonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel settings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[RSVLM-QA: A Benchmark Dataset for Remote Sensing Vision Language Model-based Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07918v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Question Answering (VQA) in remote sensing (RS) is pivotal for interpreting Earth observation data. However, existing RS VQA datasets are constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain. RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1 then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises 13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Multimedia Conference (ACM Multimedia 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Griffon v2: Advancing Multimodal Perception with High-Resolution Scaling and Visual-Language Co-Referring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09333v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models have achieved fine-grained object perception, but the limitation of image resolution remains a significant obstacle to surpassing the performance of task-specific experts in complex and dense scenarios. Such limitation further restricts the model's potential to achieve nuanced visual and language referring in domains such as GUI Agents, counting, \textit{etc}. To address this issue, we introduce a unified high-resolution generalist model, Griffon v2, enabling flexible object referring with visual and textual prompts. To efficiently scale up image resolution, we design a simple and lightweight down-sampling projector to overcome the input tokens constraint in Large Language Models. This design inherently preserves the complete contexts and fine details and significantly improves multimodal perception ability, especially for small objects. Building upon this, we further equip the model with visual-language co-referring capabilities through a plug-and-play visual tokenizer. It enables user-friendly interaction with flexible target images, free-form texts, and even coordinates. Experiments demonstrate that Griffon v2 can localize objects of interest with visual and textual referring, achieve state-of-the-art performance on REC and phrase grounding, and outperform expert models in object detection, object counting, and REG.

Addressing this by annotating new data and fully retraining the model is time-consuming and does not guarantee generalization to additional novel categories at test time. Instead, we propose an alternative paradigm: Given a category name, tune a compact concept embedding derived from the prompt using synthetic images and pseudo-labels generated by a text-to-image diffusion model. This embedding conditions a specialization module that refines raw overcounts from any frozen counter into accurate, category-specific estimates\textemdash without requiring real images or human annotations. We validate our approach on \textsc{Lookalikes}, a challenging new benchmark containing 1,037 images across 27 fine-grained subcategories, and show substantial improvements over strong baselines. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[CountQA: How Well Do MLLMs Count in the Wild?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06585v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable fluency in understanding visual scenes, yet they exhibit a critical lack in a fundamental cognitive skill: object counting. This blind spot severely limits their reliability in real-world applications. To date, this capability has been largely unevaluated in complex scenarios, as existing benchmarks either feature sparse object densities or are confined to specific visual domains, failing to test models under realistic conditions. Addressing this gap, we introduce CountQA, a challenging new benchmark designed to probe this deficiency. Comprising over 1,500 question-answer pairs, CountQA features real-world images with high object density, clutter, and occlusion. We investigate this weakness by evaluating 15 prominent MLLMs on the CountQA benchmark and reveal that the top-performing model achieves a mere 42.9% accuracy, with performance declining as object counts rise. By providing a dedicated benchmark to diagnose and rectify this core weakness, CountQA paves the way for a new generation of MLLMs that are not only descriptively fluent but also numerically grounded and spatially aware. We will open-source the dataset and code upon paper acceptance to foster further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised deep learning model for fast energy layer pre-selection of delivery-efficient proton arc therapy plan optimization of nasopharyngeal carcinoma](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15803v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proton arc therapy (PAT) is an emerging and promising modality in radiotherapy, offering improved dose distribution and treatment robustness over intensity-modulated proton therapy. Yet, identifying the optimal energy layer (EL) sequence remains challenging due to the intensive computational demand and prolonged treatment delivery time. This study proposes an unsupervised deep learning model for fast EL pre-selection that minimizes EL switch (ELS) time while maintaining high plan quality. We introduce a novel data representation method, spot-count representation, which encodes the number of proton spots intersecting the target and organs at risk (OAR) in a matrix structured by sorted gantry angles and energy layers. This representation serves as the input of an U-Net style architecture, SPArc_dl, which is trained using a tri-objective function: maximizing spot-counts on target, minimizing spot-counts on OAR, and reducing ELS time. The model is evaluated on 35 nasopharyngeal cancer cases, and its performance is compared to SPArc_particle_swarm (SPArc_ps). SPArc_dl produces EL pre-selection that significantly improves both plan quality and delivery efficiency. Compared to SPArc_ps, it enhances the conformity index by 0.1 (p<0.01), reduces the homogeneity index by 0.71 (p<0.01), lowers the brainstem mean dose by 0.25 (p<0.01), and shortens the ELS time by 37.2% (p < 0.01). The results unintentionally reveal employing unchanged ELS is more time-wise efficient than descended ELS. SPArc_dl's inference time is within 1 second. However, SPArc_dl plan demonstrates limitation in robustness. The proposed spot-count representation lays a foundation for incorporating unsupervised deep learning approaches into EL pre-selection task. SPArc_dl is a fast tool for generating high-quality PAT plans by strategically pre-selecting EL to reduce delivery time while maintaining excellent dosimetric performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Scoring for Machine Learning Classifier Error Impact Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04489v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample. Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors. Python implementations of the scoring metrics will be available in an open-source repository at time of publication.</p></details> |  |

However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate, real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus, for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data, independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational responses for platform crowding mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 17 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Leveraging representation alignment and a hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object count estimation and fine-grained guidance for generative models.

To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations, including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM25 has accepted this paper</p></details> |

Effectively querying this data is essential to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data, state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories, resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle to handle the challenge of stacked 3D objects in which most objects are hidden by those above them. To address this important yet underexplored problem, we propose a novel 3D counting approach that decomposes the task into two complementary subproblems - estimating the 3D geometry of the object stack and the occupancy ratio from multi-view images. By combining geometric reconstruction and deep learning-based depth analysis, our method can accurately count identical objects within containers, even when they are irregularly stacked. We validate our 3D Counting pipeline on diverse real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets, which we will release publicly to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV2...</summary><p>ICCV25 Oral.

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

| **[Enhancing Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models through Intermediate Projector Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However, current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage, without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparative Study of Decoding Strategies in Medical Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13580v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare, where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks, including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding. Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes exceed that of model choice.</p></details> |  |
| **[DermINO: Hybrid Pretraining for a Versatile Dermatology Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12190v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skin diseases impose a substantial burden on global healthcare systems, driven by their high prevalence (affecting up to 70% of the population), complex diagnostic processes, and a critical shortage of dermatologists in resource-limited areas. While artificial intelligence(AI) tools have demonstrated promise in dermatological image analysis, current models face limitations-they often rely on large, manually labeled datasets and are built for narrow, specific tasks, making them less effective in real-world settings. To tackle these limitations, we present DermNIO, a versatile foundation model for dermatology. Trained on a curated dataset of 432,776 images from three sources (public repositories, web-sourced images, and proprietary collections), DermNIO incorporates a novel hybrid pretraining framework that augments the self-supervised learning paradigm through semi-supervised learning and knowledge-guided prototype initialization. This integrated method not only deepens the understanding of complex dermatological conditions, but also substantially enhances the generalization capability across various clinical tasks. Evaluated across 20 datasets, DermNIO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across a wide range of tasks. It excels in high-level clinical applications including malignancy classification, disease severity grading, multi-category diagnosis, and dermatological image caption, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance in low-level tasks such as skin lesion segmentation. Furthermore, DermNIO demonstrates strong robustness in privacy-preserving federated learning scenarios and across diverse skin types and sexes. In a blinded reader study with 23 dermatologists, DermNIO achieved 95.79% diagnostic accuracy (versus clinicians' 73.66%), and AI assistance improved clinician performance by 17.21%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptively Clustering Neighbor Elements for Image-Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01955v4)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel Transformer-based image-to-text generation model termed as \textbf{ACF} that adaptively clusters vision patches into object regions and language words into phrases to implicitly learn object-phrase alignments for better visual-text coherence. To achieve this, we design a novel self-attention layer that applies self-attention over the elements in a local cluster window instead of the whole sequence. The window size is softly decided by a clustering matrix that is calculated by the current input data and thus this process is adaptive. By stacking these revised self-attention layers to construct ACF, the small clusters in the lower layers can be grouped into a bigger cluster, \eg vision/language. ACF clusters small objects/phrases into bigger ones. In this gradual clustering process, a parsing tree is generated which embeds the hierarchical knowledge of the input sequence. As a result, by using ACF to build the vision encoder and language decoder, the hierarchical object-phrase alignments are embedded and then transferred from vision to language domains in two popular image-to-text tasks: Image captioning and Visual Question Answering. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACF, which outperforms most SOTA captioning and VQA models and achieves comparable scores compared with some large-scale pre-trained models.

In this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Are Large Pre-trained Vision Language Models Effective Construction Safety Inspectors?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11011v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets, limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques, providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stepwise Decomposition and Dual-stream Focus: A Novel Approach for Training-free Camouflaged Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06818v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2) \textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation, causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream \textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity, while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

However, achieving high geometric precision and editability requires representing figures as graphics programs in languages like TikZ, and aligned training data (i.e., graphics programs with captions) remains scarce. Meanwhile, large amounts of unaligned graphics programs and captioned raster images are more readily available. We reconcile these disparate data sources by presenting TikZero, which decouples graphics program generation from text understanding by using image representations as an intermediary bridge. It enables independent training on graphics programs and captioned images and allows for zero-shot text-guided graphics program synthesis during inference. We show that our method substantially outperforms baselines that can only operate with caption-aligned graphics programs. Furthermore, when leveraging caption-aligned graphics programs as a complementary training signal, TikZero matches or exceeds the performance of much larger models, including commercial systems like GPT-4o. Our code, datasets, and select models are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025 (highlight); Project page: https://github.com/potamides/DeTikZify</p></details> |

Despite their wide application, it is, however, not understood how these models compare their two inputs. Common first-order feature-attribution methods explain importances of individual features and can, thus, only provide limited insights into dual encoders, whose predictions depend on interactions between features. In this paper, we first derive a second-order method enabling the attribution of predictions by any differentiable dual encoder onto feature-interactions between its inputs. Second, we apply our method to Clip models and show that they learn fine-grained correspondences between parts of captions and regions in images. They match objects across input modes and also account for mismatches. This intrinsic visual-linguistic grounding ability, however, varies heavily between object classes, exhibits pronounced out-of-domain effects and we can identify individual errors as well as systematic failure categories.

To address this issue, we introduce a visual comprehension stage, which we call ViCToR (Visual Comprehension via Token Reconstruction), a novel pretraining framework for LMMs. ViCToR employs a learnable visual token pool and utilizes the Hungarian matching algorithm to select semantically relevant tokens from this pool for visual token replacement. Furthermore, by integrating a visual token reconstruction loss with dense semantic supervision, ViCToR can learn tokens which retain high visual detail, thereby enhancing the large language model's (LLM's) understanding of visual information. After pretraining on 3 million publicly accessible images and captions, ViCToR achieves state-of-the-art results, improving over LLaVA-NeXT-8B by 10.4%, 3.2%, and 7.2% on the MMStar, SEED$^I$, and RealWorldQA benchmarks, respectively.

While existing detection methods have achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models, since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images. Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images, which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization, outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and CommunityForensics.</p></details> | Work in progress |

In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs, underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Vision-Language Models, Frequency-Domain Perturbations, Adversarial Robustness, Image Authenticity, Reliability</p></details> |

However, training these models requires large-scale datasets, which brings challenges related to efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of web data. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a new data synthesis and curation method for generating image-caption pairs. Unlike traditional methods, where captions are generated from images, SynthVLM utilizes advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to synthesize and select images from text captions, thereby creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. We further introduce SynthVLM-100K, a high-quality dataset consisting of 100K curated and synthesized image-caption pairs. In both model and human evaluations, SynthVLM-100K outperforms traditional real-world datasets. Leveraging this dataset, we develop a new family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B, which achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various vision question-answering (VQA) tasks. Notably, our models outperform LLaVA across most metrics with only 18\% pretrain data. Furthermore, SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B attain SOTA performance on the MMLU benchmark, demonstrating that the high-quality SynthVLM-100K dataset preserves language abilities.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RS VQA datasets are constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain. RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1 then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises 13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Multimedia Conference (ACM Multimedia 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Effortless Vision-Language Model Specialization in Histopathology without Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07835v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in histopathology, such as CONCH and QuiltNet, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification capabilities across various tasks. However, their general-purpose design may lead to suboptimal performance in specific downstream applications. While supervised fine-tuning methods address this issue, they require manually labeled samples for adaptation. This paper investigates annotation-free adaptation of VLMs through continued pretraining on domain- and task-relevant image-caption pairs extracted from existing databases. Our experiments on two VLMs, CONCH and QuiltNet, across three downstream tasks reveal that these pairs substantially enhance both zero-shot and few-shot performance. Notably, with larger training sizes, continued pretraining matches the performance of few-shot methods while eliminating manual labeling. Its effectiveness, task-agnostic design, and annotation-free workflow make it a promising pathway for adapting VLMs to new histopathology tasks.

| **[RORPCap: Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07318v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for input images in an open-form manner. To accurately generate descriptions related to the image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and understand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically capitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection information, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To address these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image Captioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text retrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap employs an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and relation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined prompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping network is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to visual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and visual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature embeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive experiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap requires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5% CIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the "Karpathy" test split. RORPCap achieves comparable performance metrics to detector-based and GCN-based models with the shortest training time and demonstrates its potential as an alternative for image captioning.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose Attention-Guided Image Captioning (AGIC), which amplifies salient visual regions directly in the feature space to guide caption generation. We further introduce a hybrid decoding strategy that combines deterministic and probabilistic sampling to balance fluency and diversity. To evaluate AGIC, we conduct extensive experiments on the Flickr8k and Flickr30k datasets. The results show that AGIC matches or surpasses several state-of-the-art models while achieving faster inference. Moreover, AGIC demonstrates strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for image captioning.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 Figures |

Our crucial technique lies in the design of the reward function to incentivize accurate caption corrections. Specifically, the predicted and reference captions are decomposed into object, attribute, and relation sets using scene-graph parsing algorithms. We calculate the set difference between sets of initial and self-corrected captions to identify added and removed elements. These elements are matched against the reference sets to calculate correctness bonuses for accurate refinements and mistake punishments for wrong additions and removals, thereby forming the final reward. For image caption quality assessment, we propose a set of metrics refined from CAPTURE that alleviate its incomplete precision evaluation and inefficient relation matching problems. Furthermore, we collect a fine-grained annotated image caption dataset, RefinedCaps, consisting of 6.5K diverse images from COCO dataset. Experiments show that applying SC-Captioner on large visual-language models can generate better image captions across various scenarios, significantly outperforming the direct preference optimization training strategy.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Recent studies have explored contrastive decoding as a training-free solution. However, these methods typically construct contrastive visual inputs by perturbing the original image, resulting in distorted contrastive distributions, incomplete contrastive signals, and excessive suppression of language priors. Motivated by the observation that language priors tend to remain consistent across different images, we propose Cross-Image Contrastive Decoding (CICD), a simple yet effective training-free method that uses unrelated images as contrastive visual inputs. To address the issue of over-suppressing language priors, which can negatively affect the quality of generated responses, we further introduce a dynamic selection mechanism based on the cross-image differences in model behavior. By selectively suppressing language priors, our method reduces hallucinations without compromising the model's performance. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of CICD, particularly in image captioning, where language priors are especially dominant.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, their potential for leveraging multi-modal contextual information in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, this paper introduces Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (M$^2$RAG), a benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Multi-modal Large Language Models in leveraging knowledge from multi-modal retrieval documents. The benchmark comprises four tasks: image captioning, multi-modal question answering, multi-modal fact verification, and image reranking. All tasks are set in an open-domain setting, requiring RAG models to retrieve query-relevant information from a multi-modal document collection and use it as contextual input for RAG modeling. To enhance the context utilization capabilities of MLLMs, we also introduce Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Instruction Tuning (MM-RAIT), an instruction tuning method that optimizes MLLMs within multi-modal contexts. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MM-RAIT by significantly improving the quality of responses generated by different RAG models, outperforming MiniCPM-V 2.6 and Qwen2-VL with 34% and 33% gains, respectively.

This absence limits their usefulness for developing accurate report generation AI. To address this gap, we present AbdomenAtlas 3.0, the first public, high-quality abdominal CT dataset with detailed, expert-reviewed radiology reports. All reports are paired with per-voxel masks and they describe liver, kidney and pancreatic tumors. AbdomenAtlas 3.0 has 9,262 triplets of CT, mask and report--3,955 with tumors. These CT scans come from 17 public datasets. Besides creating the reports for these datasets, we expanded their number of tumor masks by 4.2x, identifying 3,011 new tumor cases. Notably, the reports in AbdomenAtlas 3.0 are more standardized, and generated faster than traditional human-made reports. They provide details like tumor size, location, attenuation and surgical resectability. These reports were created by 12 board-certified radiologists using our proposed RadGPT, a novel framework that converted radiologist-revised tumor segmentation masks into structured and narrative reports. Besides being a dataset creation tool, RadGPT can also become a fully-automatic, segmentation-assisted report generation method. We benchmarked this method and 5 state-of-the-art report generation vision-language models. Our results show that segmentation strongly improves tumor detection in AI-made reports.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we describe how such distributions can be projected to a low-dimensional space using uncertainty-aware principal component analysis (UAPCA). We propose to model multidimensional distributions using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and derive the projection from a general formulation that allows projecting arbitrary probability density functions. The low-dimensional projections of the densities exhibit more details about the distributions and represent them more faithfully compared to UAPCA mappings. Further, we support including user-defined weights between the different distributions, which allows for varying the importance of the multidimensional distributions. We evaluate our approach by comparing the distributions in low-dimensional space obtained by our method and UAPCA to those obtained by sample-based projections.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Unfortunately, researchers use the term "social context" in varied ways. This can lead to miscommunication, making it challenging to draw connections between related work on understanding and modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions. To address this gap, we survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term "social context". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social context of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and we discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers plan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights after interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open research questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems</p></details> |

However, existing centralized approaches face significant scalability challenges when managing and coordinating the collaboration between IoT devices of diverse capabilities in large-scale heterogeneous IoT systems. This paper introduces LLMind 2.0, a distributed IoT automation framework that addresses the scalability challenges through lightweight LLM-empowered device agents via natural language-based machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Unlike previous LLM-controlled automation systems that rely on a centralized coordinator to generate device-specific code to be executed on individual devices, LLMind 2.0 distributes intelligence across individual devices through lightweight LLMs embedded in IoT devices. The central coordinator translates human instructions into simple subtasks described in natural human language, which are then processed by device-specific agents to generate device-specific code locally at the associated devices. This approach transcends device heterogeneity barriers by using natural language as a unified communication medium, enabling seamless collaboration between devices from different manufacturers. The system incorporates several key innovations: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism for accurate subtask-to-API mapping, fine-tuned lightweight LLMs for reliable code generation, and a finite state machine-based task execution framework. Experimental validation in multi-robot warehouse scenarios and real-world WiFi network deployments demonstrates significant improvements in scalability, reliability, and privacy protection compared to the centralized approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual weighted physics informed neural network for forward and inverse problems of low grade brain tumors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07058v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A low-grade tumor is a slow-growing tumor with a lower likelihood of spreading compared to high-grade tumors. Mathematical modeling using partial differential equations (PDEs) plays a crucial role in describing tumor behavior, growth, and progression. This study employs the Burgess and extended Fisher Kolmogorov equations to investigate the dynamics of low-grade brain tumors. We introduce a new method, termed the Residual Weighted Physics-Informed Neural Network (RW PINN), designed to enhance the accuracy of PINN-based algorithms. The proposed approach assigns a weight proportional to the PDE residual, scales it accordingly, and incorporates the weighted residual into the loss function to achieve more efficient and stable convergence. Using this novel RW PINN algorithm, we develop an automated numerical solver for these models and explore their application in solving forward and inverse problems in brain tumor dynamics. The study demonstrates that RW PINN based algorithms provide advanced methodologies for modeling brain tumor dynamics by integrating deep learning with physics-informed principles. Additionally, we establish generalized error bounds in terms of training and quadrature errors, and derive the convergence and stability of the neural network for both models. Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithms in nonlinear cases, and a statistical analysis of the results is presented. To further validate the effectiveness of our methodology, we also implemented PINN based forward and inverse frameworks for low-grade brain tumors and performed a comparative analysis with the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exit Stories: Using Reddit Self-Disclosures to Understand Disengagement from Problematic Communities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13837v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online platforms like Reddit are increasingly becoming popular for individuals sharing personal experiences of leaving behind social, ideological, and political groups. Specifically, a series of "ex-" subreddits on Reddit allow users to recount their departures from commitments such as religious affiliations, manosphere communities, conspiracy theories or political beliefs, and lifestyle choices. Understanding the natural process through which users exit, especially from problematic groups such as conspiracy theory communities and the manosphere, can provide valuable insights for designing interventions targeting disengagement from harmful ideologies. This paper presents an in-depth exploration of 15K exit stories across 131 subreddits, focusing on five key areas: religion, manosphere, conspiracy theories, politics, and lifestyle. Using a transdisciplinary framework that incorporates theories from social psychology, organizational behavior, and violent extremism studies, this work identifies a range of factors contributing to disengagement. The results describe how disengagement from problematic groups, such as conspiracy theories and the manosphere, is a multi-faceted process that is qualitatively different than disengaging from more established social structures, such as religions or political ideologies. This research further highlights the need for moving beyond interventions that treat conspiracy theorizing solely as an information problem and contributes insights for future research focusing on offering mental health interventions and support in exit communities.</p></details> |  |

Many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed, although less research has been devoted to describe their theoretical limitations. In this work, we take a first-principles approach and build on our earlier definition of reconstructability-the fraction of structural information recoverable from data. We relate this quantity to the true data-generating (TDG) process and delineate an information-theoretic reconstruction limit, i.e., the upper bound of the mutual information between the true underlying graph and any graph reconstructed from observations. These concepts lead us to a principled numerical method to assess the validity of empirically reconstructed networks, based on model selection and a quantity we introduce: the reconstruction index. This index approximates the reconstructability from data, quantifies the variability of the reconstructed network ensemble, and is shown to predict reconstruction error without requiring knowledge of the true underlying network. We characterize this method and test it on empirical time series and networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models (LLMs) Describe Pictures Like Children? A Comparative Corpus Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13769v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity, highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns. The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed educational tools.</p></details> |  |

While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding, their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction. Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost.

However, current works treat different tools as isolated components and fail to leverage the inherent dependencies of tools, leading to invalid planning results. Since tool dependencies are often incomplete, it becomes challenging for LLMs to accurately identify the appropriate tools required by a user request, especially when confronted with a large toolset. To solve this challenge, we propose \texttt{GTool}, which is the first work aiming to enhance the tool planning ability of LLMs under incomplete dependencies. \texttt{GTool} constructs a request-specific tool graph to select tools efficiently and generate the \texttt{<graph token>} which provides sufficient dependency information understandable by LLMs. Moreover, a missing dependency prediction task is designed to improve the reliability of \texttt{GTool} with incomplete dependencies. Without trimming LLMs, \texttt{GTool} can be seamlessly integrated with various LLM backbones without extensive retraining. Extensive experiments show that \texttt{GTool} achieves more than 29.6\% performance improvements compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines with a light-weight (7B) LLM backbone.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

This criterion assigns a distinct weight to each excursion set point based on the associated field. We apply the cmd-$n$ on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to identify the cosmic string networks (CSs) through their unique Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins effect on the temperature anisotropies. We also formulate the perturbative expansion of cmd-$n$ for the weak non-Gaussian regime up to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma_0^3)$. We propose a comprehensive pipeline designed to analyze the morphological properties of string-induced CMB maps within the flat sky approximation. To evaluate the robustness of our proposed criteria, we employ string-induced high-resolution flat-sky CMB simulated patches of $7.2$ deg$^2$ size with a resolution of $0.42$ arc-minutes. Our results demonstrate that the minimum detectable value of cosmic string tension is $G\mu\gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-7}$ when a noise-free map is analyzed with normalized cmd-$n$. Whereas for the ACT, CMB-S4, and Planck-like experiments at 95.45\% confidence level, the normalized cmd-$n$ can distinguish the CSs network for $G\mu\gtrsim2.9 \times 10^{-7}$, $G\mu\gtrsim 2.4\times 10^{-7}$ and $G\mu\gtrsim 5.8\times 10^{-7}$, respectively. The normalized cmd-$n$ exhibits a significantly enhanced capability in detecting CSs relative to the Minkowski Functionals.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures and 3 tables, comments are welcome, V2: added some references, V3: matched to the published version</p></details> |
| **[ForensicsSAM: Toward Robust and Unified Image Forgery Detection and Localization Resisting to Adversarial Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07402v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular strategy for adapting large vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and LLaVA, to downstream tasks like image forgery detection and localization (IFDL). However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model, without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization.

| **[Transferable Model-agnostic Vision-Language Model Adaptation for Efficient Weak-to-Strong Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08604v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance 'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained, this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain, often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual recognition tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, there remains a fundamental disconnect between the probabilistic 5G delay characteristics and the often idealistic delay models used to synthesize 5G-TSN network configurations. For time-driven schedules in particular, any delay outlier unforeseen during schedule synthesis can jeopardize the robustness of their real-time guarantees. To address this challenge, we present the (m,k)-firm Elevation Policy to uphold a base level of weakly hard real-time guarantees during unstable network conditions that do not match the expected delay characteristics. It augments the primary time-driven schedule with a dynamic priority-driven scheme to elevate the priority of m out of k consecutive frames if they are delayed. Our evaluations demonstrate that weakly hard real-time guarantees are essential to uphold the quality of control within a networked control system. At the same time, only a small overhead is imposed when the primary schedule can provide stronger quality of service guarantees. Our (m,k)-firm Elevation Policy thereby yields a robust but light-weight fallback mechanism to serve applications with meaningful guarantees during unstable network conditions.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Cross-BCI, A Cross-BCI-Paradigm Classifica-tion Model Towards Universal BCI Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09242v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification models used in brain-computer interface (BCI) are usually designed for a single BCI paradigm. This requires the redevelopment of the model when applying it to a new BCI paradigm, resulting in repeated costs and effort. Moreover, less complex deep learning models are desired for practical usage, as well as for deployment on portable devices. In or-der to fill the above gaps, we, in this study, proposed a light-weight and unified decoding model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification. The proposed model starts with a tempo-spatial convolution. It is followed by a multi-scale local feature selec-tion module, aiming to extract local features shared across BCI paradigms and generate weighted features. Finally, a mul-ti-dimensional global feature extraction module is designed, in which multi-dimensional global features are extracted from the weighted features and fused with the weighted features to form high-level feature representations associated with BCI para-digms. The results, evaluated on a mixture of three classical BCI paradigms (i.e., MI, SSVEP, and P300), demon-strate that the proposed model achieves 88.39%, 82.36%, 80.01%, and 0.8092 for accuracy, macro-precision, mac-ro-recall, and macro-F1-score, respectively, significantly out-performing the compared models. This study pro-vides a feasible solution for cross-BCI-paradigm classifica-tion. It lays a technological foundation for de-veloping a new generation of unified decoding systems, paving the way for low-cost and universal practical applications.</p></details> |  |

This works presents the ReQAP system that supports users with answers for complex questions that involve filters, joins and aggregation over heterogeneous sources. The unique trait of ReQAP is that it recursively decomposes questions and incrementally builds an operator tree for execution. Both the question interpretation and the individual operators make smart use of light-weight language models, with judicious fine-tuning. The demo showcases the rich functionality for advanced user questions, and also offers detailed tracking of how the answers are computed by the operators in the execution tree. Being able to trace answers back to the underlying sources is vital for human comprehensibility and user trust in the system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CIKM 2025 (demonstration paper)</p></details> |
| **[Automated Privacy Information Annotation in Large Language Model Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20910v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Users interacting with large language models (LLMs) under their real identifiers often unknowingly risk disclosing private information. Automatically notifying users whether their queries leak privacy and which phrases leak what private information has therefore become a practical need. Existing privacy detection methods, however, were designed for different objectives and application domains, typically tagging personally identifiable information (PII) in anonymous content, which is insufficient in real-name interaction scenarios with LLMs. In this work, to support the development and evaluation of privacy detection models for LLM interactions that are deployable on local user devices, we construct a large-scale multilingual dataset with 249K user queries and 154K annotated privacy phrases. In particular, we build an automated privacy annotation pipeline with strong LLMs to automatically extract privacy phrases from dialogue datasets and annotate leaked information. We also design evaluation metrics at the levels of privacy leakage, extracted privacy phrase, and privacy information. We further establish baseline methods using light-weight LLMs with both tuning-free and tuning-based methods, and report a comprehensive evaluation of their performance. Evaluation results reveal a gap between current performance and the requirements of real-world LLM applications, motivating future research into more effective local privacy detection methods grounded in our dataset.</p></details> | 8 content pages |
| **[Differentially Private Federated Clustering with Random Rebalancing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06183v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated clustering aims to group similar clients into clusters and produce one model for each cluster. Such a personalization approach typically improves model performance compared with training a single model to serve all clients, but can be more vulnerable to privacy leakage. Directly applying client-level differentially private (DP) mechanisms to federated clustering could degrade the utilities significantly. We identify that such deficiencies are mainly due to the difficulties of averaging privacy noise within each cluster (following standard privacy mechanisms), as the number of clients assigned to the same clusters is uncontrolled. To this end, we propose a simple and effective technique, named RR-Cluster, that can be viewed as a light-weight add-on to many federated clustering algorithms. RR-Cluster achieves reduced privacy noise via randomly rebalancing cluster assignments, guaranteeing a minimum number of clients assigned to each cluster. We analyze the tradeoffs between decreased privacy noise variance and potentially increased bias from incorrect assignments and provide convergence bounds for RR-Clsuter. Empirically, we demonstrate the RR-Cluster plugged into strong federated clustering algorithms results in significantly improved privacy/utility tradeoffs across both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | 21 pages |

VISTAR introduces a two-tier hybrid paradigm: it employs deterministic, scriptable metrics for physically quantifiable attributes (e.g., text rendering, lighting) and a novel Hierarchical Weighted P/N Questioning (HWPQ) scheme that uses constrained vision-language models to assess abstract semantics (e.g., style fusion, cultural fidelity). Grounded in a Delphi study with 120 experts, we defined seven user roles and nine evaluation angles to construct the benchmark, which comprises 2,845 prompts validated by over 15,000 human pairwise comparisons. Our metrics achieve high human alignment (>75%), with the HWPQ scheme reaching 85.9% accuracy on abstract semantics, significantly outperforming VQA baselines. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals no universal champion, as role-weighted scores reorder rankings and provide actionable guidance for domain-specific deployment. All resources are publicly released to foster reproducible T2I assessment.</p></details> | 17 pages,8 figures |
| **[Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators (FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion) parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of tokens for both.

However, this paradigm faces fundamental challenges: subjective tasks often lack absolute ground truth, and sparse annotation coverage makes aggregation statistically unreliable. We introduce a paradigm shift from sample-wise aggregation to annotator-wise behavior modeling. By treating annotator disagreements as valuable information rather than noise, modeling annotator-specific behavior patterns can reconstruct unlabeled data to reduce annotation cost, enhance aggregation reliability, and explain annotator decision behavior. To this end, we propose QuMAB (Query-based Multi-Annotator Behavior Pattern Learning), which uses light-weight queries to model individual annotators while capturing inter-annotator correlations as implicit regularization, preventing overfitting to sparse individual data while maintaining individualization and improving generalization, with a visualization of annotator focus regions offering an explainable analysis of behavior understanding. We contribute two large-scale datasets with dense per-annotator labels: STREET (4,300 labels/annotator) and AMER (average 3,118 labels/annotator), the first multimodal multi-annotator dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our QuMAB in modeling individual annotators' behavior patterns, their utility for consensus prediction, and applicability under sparse annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.15237</p></details> |

However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise. To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed, and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community contributions and dataset evolution.</p></details> |  |

Prior work on risk estimation either outputs coarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes indicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses narrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk Index (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks based on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting control commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning within a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) principles, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation, and an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate CRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using a state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our collision-rate metrics show a 19\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions per failed route, a 20\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a 17\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically significant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6 ms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially improves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while maintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.</p></details> | ITSC 2025, 7 pages |

While recent advances in large language models have greatly improved performance, most existing approaches depend on models with tens of billions of parameters or costly APIs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments. For real world, especially on edge devices, it is crucial for Text-to-SQL to ensure cost-effectiveness. Therefore, enabling the light-weight models for Text-to-SQL is of great practical significance. However, smaller LLMs often struggle with complicated user instruction, redundant schema linking or syntax correctness. To address these challenges, we propose MCTS-SQL, a novel framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide SQL generation through multi-step refinement. Since the light-weight models' weak performance of single-shot prediction, we generate better results through several trials with feedback. However, directly applying MCTS-based methods inevitably leads to significant time and computational overhead. Driven by this issue, we propose a token-level prefix-cache mechanism that stores prior information during iterations, effectively improved the execution speed. Experiments results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using a small open-source Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B, our method outperforms ChatGPT-3.5. When leveraging a more powerful model Gemini 2.5 to explore the performance upper bound, we achieved results competitive with the SOTA. Our findings demonstrate that even small models can be effectively deployed in practical Text-to-SQL systems with the right strategy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

However, current learning-based methods often struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency: methods that achieve high accuracy typically demand substantial processing power, while faster approaches tend to sacrifice precision. These fast approaches specifically falter in their generalization capabilities and do not perform well across diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we revisit the limitations of the SOTA methods and present NeuFlow-V2, a novel method that offers both - high accuracy in real-world datasets coupled with low computational overhead. In particular, we introduce a novel light-weight backbone and a fast refinement module to keep computational demands tractable while delivering accurate optical flow. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NeuFlow-V2 provides similar accuracy to SOTA methods while achieving 10x-70x speedups. It is capable of running at over 20 FPS on 512x384 resolution images on a Jetson Orin Nano.

Instead, neural operators rely on post hoc UQ methods that ignore geometric inductive biases. In this work, we introduce DINOZAUR: a diffusion-based neural operator parametrization with uncertainty quantification. Inspired by the structure of the heat kernel, DINOZAUR replaces the dense tensor multiplier in FNOs with a dimensionality-independent diffusion multiplier that has a single learnable time parameter per channel, drastically reducing parameter count and memory footprint without compromising predictive performance. By defining priors over those time parameters, we cast DINOZAUR as a Bayesian neural operator to yield spatially correlated outputs and calibrated uncertainty estimates. Our method achieves competitive or superior performance across several PDE benchmarks while providing efficient uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |

Existing GFSCIL approaches typically utilize Prototypical Networks (PNs) for metric-based class representations and fine-tune the model during the incremental learning stage. However, these PN-based methods oversimplify learning via novel query set fine-tuning and fail to integrate Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques due to architectural constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a more rigorous and practical setting for GFSCIL that excludes query sets during the incremental training phase. Building on this foundation, we introduce Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning (MEGA), aimed at effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting for GFSCIL. Specifically, by calculating the incremental second-order gradient during the meta-training stage, we endow the model to learn high-quality priors that enhance incremental learning by aligning its behaviors across both the meta-training and incremental learning stages. Extensive experiments on four mainstream graph datasets demonstrate that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art results and enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in GFSCIL. We believe that our proposed MEGA serves as a model-agnostic GFSCIL paradigm, paving the way for future research.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[SEDEG:Sequential Enhancement of Decoder and Encoder's Generality for Class Incremental Learning with Small Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12932v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In incremental learning, enhancing the generality of knowledge is crucial for adapting to dynamic data inputs. It can develop generalized representations or more balanced decision boundaries, preventing the degradation of long-term knowledge over time and thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Some emerging incremental learning methods adopt an encoder-decoder architecture and have achieved promising results. In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the generalization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it helps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and robustness to new, diverse data inputs. However, many existing continual methods focus solely on enhancing one of the two components, which limits their effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. And these methods perform even worse in small-memory scenarios, where only a limited number of historical samples can be stored. To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a two-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on sequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially, SEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized representations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and balance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation (KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more generalized encoder. This involves using a balanced KD approach and feature KD for effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show SEDEG's superior performance, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of its components. The code is available at https://github.com/ShaolingPu/CIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICONIP2025</p></details> |
| **[Does Prior Data Matter? Exploring Joint Training in the Context of Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10003v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to adapt to continuously emerging new classes while preserving knowledge of previously learned ones. Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) presents a greater challenge that requires the model to learn new classes from only a limited number of samples per class. While incremental learning typically assumes restricted access to past data, it often remains available in many real-world scenarios. This raises a practical question: should one retrain the model on the full dataset (i.e., joint training), or continue updating it solely with new data? In CIL, joint training is considered an ideal benchmark that provides a reference for evaluating the trade-offs between performance and computational cost. However, in FSCIL, joint training becomes less reliable due to severe imbalance between base and incremental classes. This results in the absence of a practical baseline, making it unclear which strategy is preferable for practitioners. To this end, we revisit joint training in the context of FSCIL by incorporating imbalance mitigation techniques, and suggest a new imbalance-aware joint training benchmark for FSCIL. We then conduct extensive comparisons between this benchmark and FSCIL methods to analyze which approach is most suitable when prior data is accessible. Our analysis offers realistic insights and guidance for selecting training strategies in real-world FSCIL scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/shiwonkim/Joint_FSCIL</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Level Knowledge Distillation and Dynamic Self-Supervised Learning for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12692v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental with repetition (CIR), where previously trained classes repeatedly introduced in future tasks, is a more realistic scenario than the traditional class incremental setup, which assumes that each task contains unseen classes. CIR assumes that we can easily access abundant unlabeled data from external sources, such as the Internet. Therefore, we propose two components that efficiently use the unlabeled data to ensure the high stability and the plasticity of models trained in CIR setup. First, we introduce multi-level knowledge distillation (MLKD) that distills knowledge from multiple previous models across multiple perspectives, including features and logits, so the model can maintain much various previous knowledge. Moreover, we implement dynamic self-supervised loss (SSL) to utilize the unlabeled data that accelerates the learning of new classes, while dynamic weighting of SSL keeps the focus of training to the primary task. Both of our proposed components significantly improve the performance in CIR setup, achieving 2nd place in the CVPR 5th CLVISION Challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[ESSENTIAL: Episodic and Semantic Memory Integration for Video Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10896v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning (VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 ICCV Highlight paper, 17 pages including supplementary material</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Incremental Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09974v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph incremental learning is a learning paradigm that aims to adapt trained models to continuously incremented graphs and data over time without the need for retraining on the full dataset. However, regular graph machine learning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental learning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new knowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the previously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to maintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however, do not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different timestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns can be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the new data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic mixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a DyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming data blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data sequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve old tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the number of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full mixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a sparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make predictions, significantly reducing the computation time. Our model achieved 4.92\% relative accuracy increase compared to the best baselines on class incremental learning, showing the model's exceptional power.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSS-Prompt: Dynamic-Static Synergistic Prompting for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09785v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization ability has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks recently, but it is still underexplored in the challenging few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) task. It aims to continually learn new concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely, we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic forgetting issue as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACMMM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Achieving More with Less: Additive Prompt Tuning for Rehearsal-Free Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07979v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes progressively while preserving knowledge of previously learned ones. Recent advances in this field have shifted towards parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, with many approaches building upon the framework that maintains a pool of learnable prompts. Although effective, these methods introduce substantial computational overhead, primarily due to prompt pool querying and increased input sequence lengths from prompt concatenation. In this work, we present a novel prompt-based approach that addresses this limitation. Our method trains a single set of shared prompts across all tasks and, rather than concatenating prompts to the input, directly modifies the CLS token's attention computation by adding the prompts to it. This simple and lightweight design not only significantly reduces computational complexity-both in terms of inference costs and the number of trainable parameters-but also eliminates the need to optimize prompt lengths for different downstream tasks, offering a more efficient yet powerful solution for rehearsal-free class-incremental learning. Extensive experiments across a diverse range of CIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to establish a new prompt-based CIL paradigm. Furthermore, experiments on general recognition benchmarks beyond the CIL setting also show strong performance, positioning our method as a promising candidate for a general parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Cross-Stage Adversarial Transferability in Class-Incremental Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08920v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation. Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks.

| **[Multi-level Collaborative Distillation Meets Global Workspace Model: A Unified Framework for OCIL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08677v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective. While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared, implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch, capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models across various memory budgets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

Existing pre-trained model-based CIL methods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks using additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect module selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules often overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing between similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this paper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most crucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter. Furthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal adapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks. We combine task-specific and universal adapter predictions to harness both specialized and general knowledge during inference. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

However, segmentation models trained on static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work, we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than 144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an evaluation benchmark.

Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods can effectively distinguish between known and unknown classes in the data, while incremental learning enables continuous model knowledge updates. However, in open-world scenarios, these approaches still face limitations. Relying solely on OOD detection does not facilitate knowledge updates in the model, and incremental fine-tuning typically requires supervised conditions, which significantly deviate from open-world settings. To address these challenges, this paper proposes OpenHAIV, a novel framework that integrates OOD detection, new class discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning into a unified pipeline. This framework allows models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in open-world environments.

Continual learning is supposed to help train models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection). Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MICCAI 2025 workshop on Efficient Medical AI</p></details> |
| **[Sculpting Margin Penalty: Intra-Task Adapter Merging and Classifier Calibration for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05094v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL). However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200 demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning New Concepts, Remembering the Old: Continual Learning for Multimodal Concept Bottleneck Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17471v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance the interpretability of AI systems, particularly by bridging visual input with human-understandable concepts, effectively acting as a form of multimodal interpretability model. However, existing CBMs typically assume static datasets, which fundamentally limits their adaptability to real-world, continuously evolving multimodal data streams. To address this, we define a novel continual learning task for CBMs: simultaneously handling concept-incremental and class-incremental learning. This task requires models to continuously acquire new concepts (often representing cross-modal attributes) and classes while robustly preserving previously learned knowledge. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose CONceptual Continual Incremental Learning (CONCIL), a novel framework that fundamentally re-imagines concept and decision layer updates as linear regression problems. This reformulation eliminates the need for gradient-based optimization, thereby effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, CONCIL relies solely on recursive matrix operations, rendering it highly computationally efficient and well-suited for real-time and large-scale multimodal data applications. Experimental results compellingly demonstrate that CONCIL achieves "absolute knowledge memory" and significantly surpasses the performance of traditional CBM methods in both concept- and class-incremental settings, thus establishing a new paradigm for continual learning in CBMs, particularly valuable for dynamic multimodal understanding.</p></details> |  |

Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study, we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Recently, replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this, exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other replay-based methods, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However, these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
