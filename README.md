However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Interpretable 2D Video Extraction from 3D Echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15946v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the heart has complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy, conventional medical imaging with cardiac ultrasound relies on a series of 2D videos showing individual cardiac structures. 3D echocardiography is a developing modality that now offers adequate image quality for clinical use, with potential to streamline acquisition and improve assessment of off-axis features. We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes. We release the code and a dataset of 29 3D echocardiography videos https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo .</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

This conditioning regime was formulated through survival functions and termed the accelerated failure conditionals model. Subsequently, Lakhani (2025) extended this conditioning framework to encompass distributional families whose marginal densities may exhibit unimodality and skewness, thereby moving beyond families with non-increasing densities. The present study builds on this line of work by proposing a conditional survival specification derived from a location-scale distributional family, where the dependence between $X$ and $Y$ arises not only through the acceleration function but also via a location function. An illustrative example of this new specification is developed using a Weibull marginal for $X$. The resulting models are fully characterized by closed-form expressions for their moments, and simulations are implemented using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Finally, the model is applied to a dataset in which the empirical distribution of $Y$ lies on the real line, demonstrating the models' capacity to accommodate $Y$ marginals defined over $\mathbb{R}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This does not align well with existing psychological measures, which are commonly intended to assess 3-5 dimensions of a latent construct. In this paper, I introduce a multidimensional MNLFA model that permits the moderation of item intercepts, loadings, residual variances, factor means, variances, and correlations across three or more latent factors. I describe efforts to implement the model using Bayesian methods through Stan and penalized maximum likelihood approaches to stabilize estimation and detect partial measurement non-invariance while preserving model interpretability. Closed-form analytic gradients of the likelihood, eliminating the need for costly numerical or MCMC-based approximations. We conclude by discussing the theoretical implications of penalization for measurement invariance, computational considerations, and future directions for extending the framework to categorical indicators, longitudinal data, and applied research contexts.</p></details> | 22 pages, 2 figures |

The mechanism follows directly from the Frobenius identity $(I+B)^{p^m}=I+B^{p^m}$, which eliminates all mixed binomial terms and enforces deterministic reappearance of the seed after dispersion. We provide a detailed numerical and analytical characterisation of these revivals across several moduli, examining entropy dynamics, spatial organisation, and local stability under perturbations. The revival structure yields several useful features: predictable transitions between chaotic and ordered phases, intrinsic spatial redundancy, and robust reconstruction via replica consensus in the presence of weak additive noise. We further show that composing Laplacian operators modulo multiple primes generates significantly extended periodic orbits while preserving exact reversibility. Building on these observations, we propose an explicit reversible encoding scheme based on chaotic transients and Frobenius returns, together with practical separation conditions and noise-tolerance estimates. Potential applications include reversible steganography, structured pseudorandomness, error-tolerant information representation, and procedural pattern synthesis. The results highlight an interplay between algebraic combinatorics and cellular-automaton dynamics, suggesting further avenues for theoretical and applied development.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |

Existing embodied benchmarks largely focus on passive, static household environments and evaluate only isolated capabilities, failing to capture holistic performance in dynamic, real-world complexity. To fill this gap, we present IndustryNav, the first dynamic industrial navigation benchmark for active spatial reasoning. IndustryNav leverages 12 manually created, high-fidelity Unity warehouse scenarios featuring dynamic objects and human movement. Our evaluation employs a PointGoal navigation pipeline that effectively combines egocentric vision with global odometry to assess holistic local-global planning. Crucially, we introduce the "collision rate" and "warning rate" metrics to measure safety-oriented behaviors and distance estimation. A comprehensive study of nine state-of-the-art VLLMs (including models such as GPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5, and Gemini-2.5) reveals that closed-source models maintain a consistent advantage; however, all agents exhibit notable deficiencies in robust path planning, collision avoidance and active exploration. This highlights a critical need for embodied research to move beyond passive perception and toward tasks that demand stable planning, active exploration, and safe behavior in dynamic, real-world environment.</p></details> |  |

| **[R2PS: Worst-Case Robust Real-Time Pursuit Strategies under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17367v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing worst-case robust strategies in pursuit-evasion games (PEGs) is time-consuming, especially when real-world factors like partial observability are considered. While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies. After reinforcement learning, our policy achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world graph structures and consistently outperforms the policy directly trained on the test graphs by the existing game RL approach.</p></details> |  |

However, existing diffusion and autoregressive approaches are limited by iterative sampling, sequential decoding, or task-specific designs, which hinder efficiency and reuse. We propose Masked Denoising Generation (MDG), a unified generative framework that reformulates multi-agent behavior modeling as the reconstruction of independently noised spatiotemporal tensors. Instead of relying on diffusion time steps or discrete tokenization, MDG applies continuous, per-agent and per-timestep noise masks that enable localized denoising and controllable trajectory generation in a single or few forward passes. This mask-driven formulation generalizes across open-loop prediction, closed-loop simulation, motion planning, and conditional generation within one model. Trained on large-scale real-world driving datasets, MDG achieves competitive closed-loop performance on the Waymo Sim Agents and nuPlan Planning benchmarks, while providing efficient, consistent, and controllable open-loop multi-agent trajectory generation. These results position MDG as a simple yet versatile paradigm for multi-agent behavior modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvDiff: High Quality Video with an Event Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17492v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As neuromorphic sensors, event cameras asynchronously record changes in brightness as streams of sparse events with the advantages of high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Reconstructing intensity images from events is a highly ill-posed task due to the inherent ambiguity of absolute brightness. Early methods generally follow an end-to-end regression paradigm, directly mapping events to intensity frames in a deterministic manner. While effective to some extent, these approaches often yield perceptually inferior results and struggle to scale up in model capacity and training data. In this work, we propose EvDiff, an event-based diffusion model that follows a surrogate training framework to produce high-quality videos. To reduce the heavy computational cost of high-frame-rate video generation, we design an event-based diffusion model that performs only a single forward diffusion step, equipped with a temporally consistent EvEncoder. Furthermore, our novel Surrogate Training Framework eliminates the dependence on paired event-image datasets, allowing the model to leverage large-scale image datasets for higher capacity. The proposed EvDiff is capable of generating high-quality colorful videos solely from monochromatic event streams. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method strikes a sweet spot between fidelity and realism, outperforming existing approaches on both pixel-level and perceptual metrics.</p></details> |  |

Previous deep learning methods have been applied to radar modeling; however, they often fail to represent arbitrary shapes or have difficulty with real-world radar signals which are collected over limited viewing angles. Existing methods in optical 3D reconstruction can generate arbitrary shapes from limited camera views, but struggle when they naively treat the radar signal as a camera view. In this work, we present Radar2Shape, a denoising diffusion model that handles a partially observable radar signal for 3D reconstruction by correlating its frequencies with multiresolution shape features. Our method consists of a two-stage approach: first, Radar2Shape learns a regularized latent space with hierarchical resolutions of shape features, and second, it diffuses into this latent space by conditioning on the frequencies of the radar signal in an analogous coarse-to-fine manner. We demonstrate that Radar2Shape can successfully reconstruct arbitrary 3D shapes even from partially-observed radar signals, and we show robust generalization to two different simulation methods and real-world data. Additionally, we release two synthetic benchmark datasets to encourage future research in the high-frequency radar domain so that models like Radar2Shape can safely be adapted into real-world radar systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual World Models via Digital Twin-conditioned Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17481v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models learn to predict the temporal evolution of visual observations given a control signal, potentially enabling agents to reason about environments through forward simulation. Because of the focus on forward simulation, current world models generate predictions based on factual observations. For many emerging applications, such as comprehensive evaluations of physical AI behavior under varying conditions, the ability of world models to answer counterfactual queries, such as "what would happen if this object was removed?", is of increasing importance. We formalize counterfactual world models that additionally take interventions as explicit inputs, predicting temporal sequences under hypothetical modifications to observed scene properties. Traditional world models operate directly on entangled pixel-space representations where object properties and relationships cannot be selectively modified. This modeling choice prevents targeted interventions on specific scene properties. We introduce CWMDT, a framework to overcome those limitations, turning standard video diffusion models into effective counterfactual world models. First, CWMDT constructs digital twins of observed scenes to explicitly encode objects and their relationships, represented as structured text. Second, CWMDT applies large language models to reason over these representations and predict how a counterfactual intervention propagates through time to alter the observed scene. Third, CWMDT conditions a video diffusion model with the modified representation to generate counterfactual visual sequences. Evaluations on two benchmarks show that the CWMDT approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting that alternative representations of videos, such as the digital twins considered here, offer powerful control signals for video forward simulation-based world models.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8.

However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website: https://sketchverify.github.io/</p></details> |

The mechanism follows directly from the Frobenius identity $(I+B)^{p^m}=I+B^{p^m}$, which eliminates all mixed binomial terms and enforces deterministic reappearance of the seed after dispersion. We provide a detailed numerical and analytical characterisation of these revivals across several moduli, examining entropy dynamics, spatial organisation, and local stability under perturbations. The revival structure yields several useful features: predictable transitions between chaotic and ordered phases, intrinsic spatial redundancy, and robust reconstruction via replica consensus in the presence of weak additive noise. We further show that composing Laplacian operators modulo multiple primes generates significantly extended periodic orbits while preserving exact reversibility. Building on these observations, we propose an explicit reversible encoding scheme based on chaotic transients and Frobenius returns, together with practical separation conditions and noise-tolerance estimates. Potential applications include reversible steganography, structured pseudorandomness, error-tolerant information representation, and procedural pattern synthesis.

Existing embodied benchmarks largely focus on passive, static household environments and evaluate only isolated capabilities, failing to capture holistic performance in dynamic, real-world complexity. To fill this gap, we present IndustryNav, the first dynamic industrial navigation benchmark for active spatial reasoning. IndustryNav leverages 12 manually created, high-fidelity Unity warehouse scenarios featuring dynamic objects and human movement. Our evaluation employs a PointGoal navigation pipeline that effectively combines egocentric vision with global odometry to assess holistic local-global planning. Crucially, we introduce the "collision rate" and "warning rate" metrics to measure safety-oriented behaviors and distance estimation. A comprehensive study of nine state-of-the-art VLLMs (including models such as GPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5, and Gemini-2.5) reveals that closed-source models maintain a consistent advantage; however, all agents exhibit notable deficiencies in robust path planning, collision avoidance and active exploration. This highlights a critical need for embodied research to move beyond passive perception and toward tasks that demand stable planning, active exploration, and safe behavior in dynamic, real-world environment.</p></details> |  |

In Graphic Design, integrating computational systems into co-creative workflows presents specific challenges, as it requires balancing scientific rigour with the subjective and visual nature of design practice. Following the PRISMA methodology, we identified 872 articles, resulting in a final corpus of 71 publications describing 68 unique systems. Based on this review, we introduce GRAPHIC (Guidelines for Reviewing Algorithmic Practices in Human-centred Design and Interaction for Creativity), a framework for analysing AI-based systems applied to Graphic Design. Its goal is to understand how current systems support human-AI collaboration in the Graphic Design discipline. The framework comprises main dimensions, which our analysis revealed to be essential across diverse system types: (1) Collaborative Panorama, (2) Processes and Modalities, and (3) Graphic Design Principles. Its application revealed research gaps, including the need to balance initiative and control between agents, improve communication through explainable interaction models, and promote systems that support transformational creativity grounded in core design principles.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |

The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes. We release the code and a dataset of 29 3D echocardiography videos https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo .</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

The mechanism follows directly from the Frobenius identity $(I+B)^{p^m}=I+B^{p^m}$, which eliminates all mixed binomial terms and enforces deterministic reappearance of the seed after dispersion. We provide a detailed numerical and analytical characterisation of these revivals across several moduli, examining entropy dynamics, spatial organisation, and local stability under perturbations. The revival structure yields several useful features: predictable transitions between chaotic and ordered phases, intrinsic spatial redundancy, and robust reconstruction via replica consensus in the presence of weak additive noise. We further show that composing Laplacian operators modulo multiple primes generates significantly extended periodic orbits while preserving exact reversibility. Building on these observations, we propose an explicit reversible encoding scheme based on chaotic transients and Frobenius returns, together with practical separation conditions and noise-tolerance estimates. Potential applications include reversible steganography, structured pseudorandomness, error-tolerant information representation, and procedural pattern synthesis. The results highlight an interplay between algebraic combinatorics and cellular-automaton dynamics, suggesting further avenues for theoretical and applied development.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |

Existing embodied benchmarks largely focus on passive, static household environments and evaluate only isolated capabilities, failing to capture holistic performance in dynamic, real-world complexity. To fill this gap, we present IndustryNav, the first dynamic industrial navigation benchmark for active spatial reasoning. IndustryNav leverages 12 manually created, high-fidelity Unity warehouse scenarios featuring dynamic objects and human movement. Our evaluation employs a PointGoal navigation pipeline that effectively combines egocentric vision with global odometry to assess holistic local-global planning. Crucially, we introduce the "collision rate" and "warning rate" metrics to measure safety-oriented behaviors and distance estimation. A comprehensive study of nine state-of-the-art VLLMs (including models such as GPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5, and Gemini-2.5) reveals that closed-source models maintain a consistent advantage; however, all agents exhibit notable deficiencies in robust path planning, collision avoidance and active exploration. This highlights a critical need for embodied research to move beyond passive perception and toward tasks that demand stable planning, active exploration, and safe behavior in dynamic, real-world environment.</p></details> |  |

However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Interpretable 2D Video Extraction from 3D Echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15946v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the heart has complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy, conventional medical imaging with cardiac ultrasound relies on a series of 2D videos showing individual cardiac structures. 3D echocardiography is a developing modality that now offers adequate image quality for clinical use, with potential to streamline acquisition and improve assessment of off-axis features. We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement).

| **[InTAct: Interval-based Task Activation Consolidation for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17439v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning aims to enable neural networks to acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. While recent prompt-based methods perform strongly in class-incremental settings, they remain vulnerable under domain shifts, where the input distribution changes but the label space remains fixed. This exposes a persistent problem known as representation drift. Shared representations evolve in ways that overwrite previously useful features and cause forgetting even when prompts isolate task-specific parameters. To address this issue, we introduce InTAct, a method that preserves functional behavior in shared layers without freezing parameters or storing past data. InTAct captures the characteristic activation ranges associated with previously learned tasks and constrains updates to ensure the network remains consistent within these regions, while still allowing for flexible adaptation elsewhere. In doing so, InTAct stabilizes the functional role of important neurons rather than directly restricting parameter values. The approach is architecture-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing prompt-based continual learning frameworks. By regulating representation changes where past knowledge is encoded, InTAct achieves a principled balance between stability and plasticity. Across diverse domain-incremental benchmarks, including DomainNet and ImageNet-R, InTAct consistently reduces representation drift and improves performance, increasing Average Accuracy by up to 8 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
