| **[Simulation-Driven Deep Learning Framework for Raman Spectral Denoising Under Fluorescence-Dominant Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17852v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Raman spectroscopy enables non-destructive, label-free molecular analysis with high specificity, making it a powerful tool for biomedical diagnostics. However, its application to biological tissues is challenged by inherently weak Raman scattering and strong fluorescence background, which significantly degrade signal quality. In this study, we present a simulation-driven denoising framework that combines a statistically grounded noise model with deep learning to enhance Raman spectra acquired under fluorescence-dominated conditions. We comprehensively modeled major noise sources. Based on this model, we generated biologically realistic Raman spectra and used them to train a cascaded deep neural network designed to jointly suppress stochastic detector noise and fluorescence baseline interference. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we simulated human skin spectra derived from real experimental data as a validation case study. Our results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed learning to improve spectral quality and enable faster, more accurate Raman-based tissue analysis.</p></details> |  |

As newer releases of these libraries are published, developers may opt to pin their dependencies to a particular version. While pinning may have benefits in ensuring reproducible builds and avoiding breaking changes, it bears larger risks in using outdated dependencies that may contain bugs and security vulnerabilities. To understand the frequency and consequences of dependency pinning, we first define the concepts of stale and fresh pins, which are distinguished based on how outdated the dependency is relative to the release date of the project. We conduct an empirical study to show that over 60% of consumers of popular Maven libraries contain stale pins to their dependencies, with some outdated versions over a year old. These pinned versions often miss out on security fixes; we find that 10% of all dependency upgrades in our dataset to the latest minor or patch version would reduce security vulnerabilities. We prototype an approach called Pin-Freshener that can encourage developers to freshen their pins by leveraging the insight that crowdsourced tests of peer projects can provide additional signal for the safety of an upgrade. Running Pin-Freshener on dependency upgrades shows that just 1-5 additional test suites can provide 35-100% more coverage of a dependency, compared to that of a single consumer test suite. Our evaluation on real-world pins to the top 500 popular libraries in Maven shows that Pin-Freshener can provide an additional signal of at least 5 passing crowdsourced test suites to over 3,000 consumers to safely perform an upgrade that reduces security vulnerabilities. Pin-Freshener can provide practical confidence to developers by offering additional signal beyond their own test suites, representing an improvement over current practices.</p></details> |  |

| **[Long-Range depth estimation using learning based Hybrid Distortion Model for CCTV cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17784v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate camera models are essential for photogrammetry applications such as 3D mapping and object localization, particularly for long distances. Various stereo-camera based 3D localization methods are available but are limited to few hundreds of meters' range. This is majorly due to the limitation of the distortion models assumed for the non-linearities present in the camera lens. This paper presents a framework for modeling a suitable distortion model that can be used for localizing the objects at longer distances. It is well known that neural networks can be a better alternative to model a highly complex non-linear lens distortion function; on contrary, it is observed that a direct application of neural networks to distortion models fails to converge to estimate the camera parameters. To resolve this, a hybrid approach is presented in this paper where the conventional distortion models are initially extended to incorporate higher-order terms and then enhanced using neural network based residual correction model. This hybrid approach has substantially improved long-range localization performance and is capable of estimating the 3D position of objects at distances up to 5 kilometres. The estimated 3D coordinates are transformed to GIS coordinates and are plotted on a GIS map for visualization. Experimental validation demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of proposed framework, offering a practical solution to calibrate CCTV cameras for long-range photogrammetry applications.</p></details> |  |

To unify vision generation and understanding, a burgeoning trend is to adopt high-dimensional features from representation encoders as generative latents. However, we empirically identify two fundamental obstacles in this paradigm: (1) the discriminative feature space lacks compact regularization, making diffusion models prone to off-manifold latents that lead to inaccurate object structures; and (2) the encoder's inherently weak pixel-level reconstruction hinders the generator from learning accurate fine-grained geometry and texture. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks. We introduce a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, enabling the compression of both semantic information and fine-grained details into a highly compact representation (96 channels with 16x16 spatial downsampling). This design ensures that the latent space remains semantically rich and achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, while remaining compact enough for accurate generation. Leveraging this representation, we design a unified Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing model. Benchmarking against various feature spaces, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks, validating that representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jshilong.github.io/PS-VAE-PAGE/</p></details> |
| **[Re-Depth Anything: Test-Time Depth Refinement via Self-Supervised Re-lighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17908v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular depth estimation remains challenging as recent foundation models, such as Depth Anything V2 (DA-V2), struggle with real-world images that are far from the training distribution. We introduce Re-Depth Anything, a test-time self-supervision framework that bridges this domain gap by fusing DA-V2 with the powerful priors of large-scale 2D diffusion models. Our method performs label-free refinement directly on the input image by re-lighting predicted depth maps and augmenting the input. This re-synthesis method replaces classical photometric reconstruction by leveraging shape from shading (SfS) cues in a new, generative context with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To prevent optimization collapse, our framework employs a targeted optimization strategy: rather than optimizing depth directly or fine-tuning the full model, we freeze the encoder and only update intermediate embeddings while also fine-tuning the decoder. Across diverse benchmarks, Re-Depth Anything yields substantial gains in depth accuracy and realism over the DA-V2, showcasing new avenues for self-supervision by augmenting geometric reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dexterous World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17907v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has made it easy to create realistic digital twins from everyday environments. However, current digital twins remain largely static and are limited to navigation and view synthesis without embodied interactivity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Dexterous World Model (DWM), a scene-action-conditioned video diffusion framework that models how dexterous human actions induce dynamic changes in static 3D scenes. Given a static 3D scene rendering and an egocentric hand motion sequence, DWM generates temporally coherent videos depicting plausible human-scene interactions. Our approach conditions video generation on (1) static scene renderings following a specified camera trajectory to ensure spatial consistency, and (2) egocentric hand mesh renderings that encode both geometry and motion cues to model action-conditioned dynamics directly. To train DWM, we construct a hybrid interaction video dataset. Synthetic egocentric interactions provide fully aligned supervision for joint locomotion and manipulation learning, while fixed-camera real-world videos contribute diverse and realistic object dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that DWM enables realistic and physically plausible interactions, such as grasping, opening, and moving objects, while maintaining camera and scene consistency. This framework represents a first step toward video diffusion-based interactive digital twins and enables embodied simulation from egocentric actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: snuvclab.github.io/dwm</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Forcing for Multi-Agent Interaction Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17900v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and generating multi-person interactions is a fundamental challenge with broad implications for robotics and social computing. While humans naturally coordinate in groups, modeling such interactions remains difficult due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing motion generation methods are largely task-specific and do not generalize to flexible multi-agent generation. We introduce MAGNet (Multi-Agent Diffusion Forcing Transformer), a unified autoregressive diffusion framework for multi-agent motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction tasks through flexible conditioning and sampling. MAGNet performs dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, and can autoregressively generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of v. Building on Diffusion Forcing, we introduce key modifications that explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. As a result, MAGNet captures both tightly synchronized activities (e.g, dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions. Our approach performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people, enabled by a scalable architecture that is agnostic to the number of agents. We refer readers to the supplemental video, where the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of generated interactions are best appreciated.

RadarGen adapts efficient image-latent diffusion to the radar domain by representing radar measurements in bird's-eye-view form that encodes spatial structure together with radar cross section (RCS) and Doppler attributes. A lightweight recovery step reconstructs point clouds from the generated maps. To better align generation with the visual scene, RadarGen incorporates BEV-aligned depth, semantic, and motion cues extracted from pretrained foundation models, which guide the stochastic generation process toward physically plausible radar patterns. Conditioning on images makes the approach broadly compatible, in principle, with existing visual datasets and simulation frameworks, offering a scalable direction for multimodal generative simulation. Evaluations on large-scale driving data show that RadarGen captures characteristic radar measurement distributions and reduces the gap to perception models trained on real data, marking a step toward unified generative simulation across sensing modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://radargen.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Weighted Stochastic Differential Equation to Implement Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao Gradient Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17878v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion models currently constitute the state of the art in continuous generative modeling. These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics. A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments.</p></details> | 26 pages, 1 figure |
| **[InSPECT: Invariant Spectral Features Preservation of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17873v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art image generation. However, the fundamental design choice of diffusing data all the way to white noise and then reconstructing it leads to an extremely difficult and computationally intractable prediction task. To overcome this limitation, we propose InSPECT (Invariant Spectral Feature-Preserving Diffusion Model), a novel diffusion model that keeps invariant spectral features during both the forward and backward processes. At the end of the forward process, the Fourier coefficients smoothly converge to a specified random noise, enabling features preservation while maintaining diversity and randomness. By preserving invariant features, InSPECT demonstrates enhanced visual diversity, faster convergence rate, and a smoother diffusion process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Celeb-A, and LSUN demonstrate that InSPECT achieves on average a 39.23% reduction in FID and 45.80% improvement in IS against DDPM for 10K iterations under specified parameter settings, which demonstrates the significant advantages of preserving invariant features: achieving superior generation quality and diversity, while enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster convergence rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze and preserve invariant spectral features in diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

As newer releases of these libraries are published, developers may opt to pin their dependencies to a particular version. While pinning may have benefits in ensuring reproducible builds and avoiding breaking changes, it bears larger risks in using outdated dependencies that may contain bugs and security vulnerabilities. To understand the frequency and consequences of dependency pinning, we first define the concepts of stale and fresh pins, which are distinguished based on how outdated the dependency is relative to the release date of the project. We conduct an empirical study to show that over 60% of consumers of popular Maven libraries contain stale pins to their dependencies, with some outdated versions over a year old. These pinned versions often miss out on security fixes; we find that 10% of all dependency upgrades in our dataset to the latest minor or patch version would reduce security vulnerabilities. We prototype an approach called Pin-Freshener that can encourage developers to freshen their pins by leveraging the insight that crowdsourced tests of peer projects can provide additional signal for the safety of an upgrade. Running Pin-Freshener on dependency upgrades shows that just 1-5 additional test suites can provide 35-100% more coverage of a dependency, compared to that of a single consumer test suite. Our evaluation on real-world pins to the top 500 popular libraries in Maven shows that Pin-Freshener can provide an additional signal of at least 5 passing crowdsourced test suites to over 3,000 consumers to safely perform an upgrade that reduces security vulnerabilities. Pin-Freshener can provide practical confidence to developers by offering additional signal beyond their own test suites, representing an improvement over current practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfSplign: Inference-Time Spatial Alignment of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17851v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models generate high-quality images but often fail to capture the spatial relations specified in text prompts. This limitation can be traced to two factors: lack of fine-grained spatial supervision in training data and inability of text embeddings to encode spatial semantics. We introduce InfSplign, a training-free inference-time method that improves spatial alignment by adjusting the noise through a compound loss in every denoising step. Proposed loss leverages different levels of cross-attention maps extracted from the backbone decoder to enforce accurate object placement and a balanced object presence during sampling. The method is lightweight, plug-and-play, and compatible with any diffusion backbone. Our comprehensive evaluations on VISOR and T2I-CompBench show that InfSplign establishes a new state-of-the-art (to the best of our knowledge), achieving substantial performance gains over the strongest existing inference-time baselines and even outperforming the fine-tuning-based methods. Codebase is available at GitHub.</p></details> |  |

While more sample-efficient than comparative alternatives like reinforcement learning, IL is sensitive to compounding errors induced by distribution shifts.

As newer releases of these libraries are published, developers may opt to pin their dependencies to a particular version. While pinning may have benefits in ensuring reproducible builds and avoiding breaking changes, it bears larger risks in using outdated dependencies that may contain bugs and security vulnerabilities. To understand the frequency and consequences of dependency pinning, we first define the concepts of stale and fresh pins, which are distinguished based on how outdated the dependency is relative to the release date of the project. We conduct an empirical study to show that over 60% of consumers of popular Maven libraries contain stale pins to their dependencies, with some outdated versions over a year old. These pinned versions often miss out on security fixes; we find that 10% of all dependency upgrades in our dataset to the latest minor or patch version would reduce security vulnerabilities. We prototype an approach called Pin-Freshener that can encourage developers to freshen their pins by leveraging the insight that crowdsourced tests of peer projects can provide additional signal for the safety of an upgrade. Running Pin-Freshener on dependency upgrades shows that just 1-5 additional test suites can provide 35-100% more coverage of a dependency, compared to that of a single consumer test suite. Our evaluation on real-world pins to the top 500 popular libraries in Maven shows that Pin-Freshener can provide an additional signal of at least 5 passing crowdsourced test suites to over 3,000 consumers to safely perform an upgrade that reduces security vulnerabilities. Pin-Freshener can provide practical confidence to developers by offering additional signal beyond their own test suites, representing an improvement over current practices.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce ReX-MLE, a benchmark of 20 challenges derived from high-impact medical imaging competitions spanning diverse modalities and task types. Unlike prior ML-agent benchmarks, ReX-MLE evaluates full end-to-end workflows, requiring agents to independently manage data preprocessing, model training, and submission under realistic compute and time constraints. Evaluating state-of-the-art agents (AIDE, ML-Master, R&D-Agent) with different LLM backends (GPT-5, Gemini, Claude), we observe a severe performance gap: most submissions rank in the 0th percentile compared to human experts.

Various stereo-camera based 3D localization methods are available but are limited to few hundreds of meters' range. This is majorly due to the limitation of the distortion models assumed for the non-linearities present in the camera lens. This paper presents a framework for modeling a suitable distortion model that can be used for localizing the objects at longer distances. It is well known that neural networks can be a better alternative to model a highly complex non-linear lens distortion function; on contrary, it is observed that a direct application of neural networks to distortion models fails to converge to estimate the camera parameters. To resolve this, a hybrid approach is presented in this paper where the conventional distortion models are initially extended to incorporate higher-order terms and then enhanced using neural network based residual correction model. This hybrid approach has substantially improved long-range localization performance and is capable of estimating the 3D position of objects at distances up to 5 kilometres. The estimated 3D coordinates are transformed to GIS coordinates and are plotted on a GIS map for visualization. Experimental validation demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of proposed framework, offering a practical solution to calibrate CCTV cameras for long-range photogrammetry applications.</p></details> |  |
