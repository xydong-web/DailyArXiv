| **[Effectiveness of Binary Autoencoders for QUBO-Based Optimization Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10037v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In black-box combinatorial optimization, objective evaluations are often expensive, so high quality solutions must be found under a limited budget. Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima. These geometric properties explain why bAE+FMQA improves the approximation ratio faster while maintaining feasibility throughout optimization, and they provide guidance for designing latent representations for black-box optimization.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in autonomous coordination, its resilience under sudden node failures remains a challenge due to dynamic topology deformation. This paper proposes a Topology-Aware Graph MAPPO (TAG-MAPPO) framework designed to enhance system survivability through autonomous 3D spatial reconfiguration. Our framework incorporates graph-based feature aggregation with a residual ego-state fusion mechanism to capture intricate inter-agent dependencies. This architecture enables the surviving swarm to rapidly adapt its topology compared to conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based approaches. Extensive simulations across heterogeneous environments, ranging from interference-limited Crowded Urban to sparse Rural areas, validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that TAG-MAPPO consistently outperforms baselines in both stability and efficiency; specifically, it reduces redundant handoffs by up to 50 percent while maintaining a lead in energy efficiency. Most notably, the framework exhibits exceptional self-healing capabilities following a catastrophic node failure. TAG-MAPPO restores over 90 percent of the pre-failure service coverage within 15 time steps, exhibiting a significantly faster V-shaped recovery trajectory than MLP baselines. Furthermore, in dense urban scenarios, the framework achieves a post-failure Jain's Fairness Index that even surpasses its original four-UAV configuration by effectively resolving service overlaps. These findings suggest that topology-aware coordination is essential for the realization of resilient 6G aerial networks and provides a robust foundation for adaptive deployments in volatile environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Faster-GS: Analyzing and Improving Gaussian Splatting Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09999v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have focused on accelerating optimization while preserving reconstruction quality. However, many proposed methods entangle implementation-level improvements with fundamental algorithmic modifications or trade performance for fidelity, leading to a fragmented research landscape that complicates fair comparison. In this work, we consolidate and evaluate the most effective and broadly applicable strategies from prior 3DGS research and augment them with several novel optimizations. We further investigate underexplored aspects of the framework, including numerical stability, Gaussian truncation, and gradient approximation. The resulting system, Faster-GS, provides a rigorously optimized algorithm that we evaluate across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Faster-GS achieves up to 5$\times$ faster training while maintaining visual quality, establishing a new cost-effective and resource efficient baseline for 3DGS optimization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizations can be applied to 4D Gaussian reconstruction, leading to efficient non-rigid scene optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://fhahlbohm.github.io/faster-gaussian-splatting</p></details> |
| **[Empirical Stability Analysis of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Hard-Constrained Recurrent Physics-Informed Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09988v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the integration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into hard-constrained recurrent physics-informed architectures (HRPINN) to evaluate the fidelity of learned residual manifolds in oscillatory systems. Motivated by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and preliminary gray-box results, we hypothesized that KANs would enable efficient recovery of unknown terms compared to MLPs. Through initial sensitivity analysis on configuration sensitivity, parameter scale, and training paradigm, we found that while small KANs are competitive on univariate polynomial residuals (Duffing), they exhibit severe hyperparameter fragility, instability in deeper configurations, and consistent failure on multiplicative terms (Van der Pol), generally outperformed by standard MLPs. These empirical challenges highlight limitations of the additive inductive bias in the original KAN formulation for state coupling and provide preliminary empirical evidence of inductive bias limitations for future hybrid modeling.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Supervised Metric Regularization Through Alternating Optimization for Multi-Regime Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09980v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) often face challenges when modeling parameterized dynamical systems with sharp regime transitions, such as bifurcations. In these scenarios, the continuous mapping from parameters to solutions can result in spectral bias or "mode collapse", where the network averages distinct physical behaviors. We propose a Topology-Aware PINN (TAPINN) that aims to mitigate this challenge by structuring the latent space via Supervised Metric Regularization. Unlike standard parametric PINNs that map physical parameters directly to solutions, our method conditions the solver on a latent state optimized to reflect the metric-based separation between regimes, showing ~49% lower physics residual (0.082 vs. 0.160). We train this architecture using a phase-based Alternating Optimization (AO) schedule to manage gradient conflicts between the metric and physics objectives. Preliminary experiments on the Duffing Oscillator demonstrate that while standard baselines suffer from spectral bias and high-capacity Hypernetworks overfit (memorizing data while violating physics), our approach achieves stable convergence with 2.18x lower gradient variance than a multi-output Sobolev Error baseline, and 5x fewer parameters than a hypernetwork-based alternative.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |
| **[SCOPE: A Training-Free Online 3D Deployment for UAV-BSs with Theoretical Analysis and Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09971v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-mounted Base Stations (UAV-BSs) offer a flexible solution for serving ground users in temporary hotspot scenarios. However, efficiently deploying UAV-BSs to satisfy heterogeneous user distributions remains a challenging optimization problem. While recent data-driven approaches, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), have shown promise in dynamic environments, they often suffer from prohibitive training overhead, poor generalization to topology changes, and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Satisfaction-driven Coverage Optimization via Perimeter Extraction (SCOPE), a training-free and online 3D deployment framework. Unlike heuristic baselines that rely on fixed-altitude assumptions, SCOPE integrates a perimeter extraction mechanism with the Smallest Enclosing Circle (SEC) algorithm to dynamically optimize 3D UAV positions. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous convergence proof of the proposed algorithm and derive its polynomial time complexity of $O(N^2 \log N)$. Experimentally, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study against state-of-the-art DRL baselines (e.g., PPO). Simulation results demonstrate that SCOPE achieves comparable user satisfaction to DRL methods but significantly lower computational latency (milliseconds vs. hours of training) and superior energy efficiency, making it an ideal solution for real-time, on-demand emergency deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, Full research paper providing a training-free determinisitc 3D UAV deployment algorithm, SCOPE.

| **[Chunking Strategies for Multimodal AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00185v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chunking has emerged as a critical technique that enhances generative models by grounding their responses in efficiently segmented knowledge [1]. While initially developed for unimodal (primarily textual) domains, recent advances in multimodal foundation models have extended chunking approaches to incorporate diverse data types, including images, audio, and video [2]. A critical component underpinning the success of these systems is the chunking strategy how large, continuous streams of multimodal data are segmented into semantically meaningful units suitable for processing [3]. Despite its importance, chunking remains an under-explored area, especially in the context of multimodal systems where modality-specific constraints, semantic preservation, and alignment across modalities introduce unique challenges. Our goal is to consolidating the landscape of multimodal chunking strategies, providing researchers and practitioners with a technical foundation and design space for developing more effective and efficient multimodal AI systems. This survey paves the way for innovations in robust chunking pipelines that scale with modality complexity, enhance processing accuracy, and improve generative coherence in real-world applications. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy and technical analysis of chunking strategies tailored for each modality: text, images, audio, video, and cross-modal data. We examine classical and modern approaches such as fixed-size token windowing, recursive text splitting, object-centric visual chunking, silence-based audio segmentation, and scene detection in videos. Each approach is analyzed in terms of its underlying methodology, supporting tools (e.g., LangChain, Detectron2, PySceneDetect), benefits, and challenges, particularly those related to granularity-context trade-offs and multimodal alignment. Furthermore, we explore emerging cross-modal chunking strategies that aim to preserve alignment and semantic consistency across disparate data types [4]. We also include comparative insights, highlight open problems such as asynchronous information density and noisy alignment signals, and identify opportunities for future research in adaptive, learning-based, and task-specific chunking.</p></details> | 50 pages, 5 figure |
| **[MonkeyTree: Near-Minimal Congestion for Multi-tenant Training via Migration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08296v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MonkeyTree, the first system to mitigate network congestion in multi-tenant GPU clusters through job-migration based defragmentation rather than network-layer techniques. As cloud operators co-locate ML training jobs on shared, oversubscribed networks, congestion degrades training throughput for over a third of jobs. Prior approaches either rely on routing and flow scheduling--which we show have fundamental limits when traffic exceeds capacity--or require costly full-bisection bandwidth topologies with packet spraying. MonkeyTree exploits characteristics of ML training traffic: ring-based collectives generate exactly one cross-rack flow per rack a job spans, making congestion-free placements achievable. The sparse constraint structure admits abundant valid configurations, making them easy to reach with few migrations. Once reached, low fragmentation is self-reinforcing, as new arrivals disturb only a few racks. MonkeyTree formulates defragmentation as an integer linear program that minimizes worker movements, subject to per-rack fragmentation bounds. We prove a tight bound showing any placement can be defragmented to at most two cross-rack fragments per ToR, and extend the formulation to hybrid parallelism with multiple rings per server. Migration is implemented via in-memory checkpoint-and-restore over RDMA, incurring only 9.02 seconds of system overhead end-to-end per worker. We evaluate MonkeyTree using a custom simulator modeling clusters of up to 2,048 H200 GPUs and prototype on a five-node A100 testbed. MonkeyTree improves average job completion time by 14 percent over the next best baseline on a cluster of 1,024 GPUs with a 4:1 oversubscription. With a high 16:1 oversubscription ratio and 2,048 GPUs, MonkeyTree keeps p99 job completion time within 5 percent of ideal.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |

Over six months in 2023-2024, GenAI-based enhancements were integrated into seven consumer-facing business workflows. We find that GenAI adoption significantly increases sales, with treatment effects ranging from $0\%$ to $16.3\%$, depending on GenAI's marginal contribution relative to existing firm practices. Because inputs and prices were held constant across experimental arms, these gains map directly into total factor productivity improvements. Across the four GenAI applications with positive sales effects, the implied annual incremental value is approximately $\$ 5$ per consumer-an economically meaningful impact given the retailer's scale and the early stage of GenAI adoption. The primary mechanism operates through higher conversion rates, consistent with GenAI reducing frictions and improving consumer experience. Importantly, these effects are not associated with worse post-purchase outcomes, as product return rates and customer ratings do not deteriorate. Finally, we document substantial demand-side heterogeneity, with larger gains for less experienced consumers. Our findings provide novel, large-scale causal evidence on the productivity effects of GenAI in online retail, highlighting both its immediate value and broader potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Field Experiments, Generative AI, Productivity, Retail Platforms, Consumer Experience.

This paper argues that this divide is mostly artificial, hindering progress in the field. We propose a viewpoint in which both MPNNs and spectral GNNs are understood as different parametrizations of permutation-equivariant operators acting on graph signals. From this perspective, many popular architectures are equivalent in expressive power, while genuine gaps arise only in specific regimes. We further argue that MPNNs and spectral GNNs offer complementary strengths. That is, MPNNs provide a natural language for discrete structure and expressivity analysis using tools from logic and graph isomorphism research, while the spectral perspective provides principled tools for understanding smoothing, bottlenecks, stability, and community structure. Overall, we posit that progress in graph learning will be accelerated by clearly understanding the key similarities and differences between these two types of GNNs, and by working towards unifying these perspectives within a common theoretical and conceptual framework rather than treating them as competing paradigms.</p></details> |  |

Our experiments demonstrate that Faster-GS achieves up to 5$\times$ faster training while maintaining visual quality, establishing a new cost-effective and resource efficient baseline for 3DGS optimization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizations can be applied to 4D Gaussian reconstruction, leading to efficient non-rigid scene optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://fhahlbohm.github.io/faster-gaussian-splatting</p></details> |

Motivated by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and preliminary gray-box results, we hypothesized that KANs would enable efficient recovery of unknown terms compared to MLPs. Through initial sensitivity analysis on configuration sensitivity, parameter scale, and training paradigm, we found that while small KANs are competitive on univariate polynomial residuals (Duffing), they exhibit severe hyperparameter fragility, instability in deeper configurations, and consistent failure on multiplicative terms (Van der Pol), generally outperformed by standard MLPs. These empirical challenges highlight limitations of the additive inductive bias in the original KAN formulation for state coupling and provide preliminary empirical evidence of inductive bias limitations for future hybrid modeling.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Supervised Metric Regularization Through Alternating Optimization for Multi-Regime Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09980v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) often face challenges when modeling parameterized dynamical systems with sharp regime transitions, such as bifurcations. In these scenarios, the continuous mapping from parameters to solutions can result in spectral bias or "mode collapse", where the network averages distinct physical behaviors. We propose a Topology-Aware PINN (TAPINN) that aims to mitigate this challenge by structuring the latent space via Supervised Metric Regularization. Unlike standard parametric PINNs that map physical parameters directly to solutions, our method conditions the solver on a latent state optimized to reflect the metric-based separation between regimes, showing ~49% lower physics residual (0.082 vs. 0.160). We train this architecture using a phase-based Alternating Optimization (AO) schedule to manage gradient conflicts between the metric and physics objectives. Preliminary experiments on the Duffing Oscillator demonstrate that while standard baselines suffer from spectral bias and high-capacity Hypernetworks overfit (memorizing data while violating physics), our approach achieves stable convergence with 2.18x lower gradient variance than a multi-output Sobolev Error baseline, and 5x fewer parameters than a hypernetwork-based alternative.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

However, efficiently deploying UAV-BSs to satisfy heterogeneous user distributions remains a challenging optimization problem. While recent data-driven approaches, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), have shown promise in dynamic environments, they often suffer from prohibitive training overhead, poor generalization to topology changes, and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Satisfaction-driven Coverage Optimization via Perimeter Extraction (SCOPE), a training-free and online 3D deployment framework. Unlike heuristic baselines that rely on fixed-altitude assumptions, SCOPE integrates a perimeter extraction mechanism with the Smallest Enclosing Circle (SEC) algorithm to dynamically optimize 3D UAV positions. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous convergence proof of the proposed algorithm and derive its polynomial time complexity of $O(N^2 \log N)$. Experimentally, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study against state-of-the-art DRL baselines (e.g., PPO). Simulation results demonstrate that SCOPE achieves comparable user satisfaction to DRL methods but significantly lower computational latency (milliseconds vs. hours of training) and superior energy efficiency, making it an ideal solution for real-time, on-demand emergency deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, Full research paper providing a training-free determinisitc 3D UAV deployment algorithm, SCOPE.

| **[Chunking Strategies for Multimodal AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00185v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chunking has emerged as a critical technique that enhances generative models by grounding their responses in efficiently segmented knowledge [1]. While initially developed for unimodal (primarily textual) domains, recent advances in multimodal foundation models have extended chunking approaches to incorporate diverse data types, including images, audio, and video [2]. A critical component underpinning the success of these systems is the chunking strategy how large, continuous streams of multimodal data are segmented into semantically meaningful units suitable for processing [3]. Despite its importance, chunking remains an under-explored area, especially in the context of multimodal systems where modality-specific constraints, semantic preservation, and alignment across modalities introduce unique challenges. Our goal is to consolidating the landscape of multimodal chunking strategies, providing researchers and practitioners with a technical foundation and design space for developing more effective and efficient multimodal AI systems. This survey paves the way for innovations in robust chunking pipelines that scale with modality complexity, enhance processing accuracy, and improve generative coherence in real-world applications. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy and technical analysis of chunking strategies tailored for each modality: text, images, audio, video, and cross-modal data. We examine classical and modern approaches such as fixed-size token windowing, recursive text splitting, object-centric visual chunking, silence-based audio segmentation, and scene detection in videos. Each approach is analyzed in terms of its underlying methodology, supporting tools (e.g., LangChain, Detectron2, PySceneDetect), benefits, and challenges, particularly those related to granularity-context trade-offs and multimodal alignment. Furthermore, we explore emerging cross-modal chunking strategies that aim to preserve alignment and semantic consistency across disparate data types [4]. We also include comparative insights, highlight open problems such as asynchronous information density and noisy alignment signals, and identify opportunities for future research in adaptive, learning-based, and task-specific chunking.</p></details> | 50 pages, 5 figure |

As cloud operators co-locate ML training jobs on shared, oversubscribed networks, congestion degrades training throughput for over a third of jobs. Prior approaches either rely on routing and flow scheduling--which we show have fundamental limits when traffic exceeds capacity--or require costly full-bisection bandwidth topologies with packet spraying. MonkeyTree exploits characteristics of ML training traffic: ring-based collectives generate exactly one cross-rack flow per rack a job spans, making congestion-free placements achievable. The sparse constraint structure admits abundant valid configurations, making them easy to reach with few migrations. Once reached, low fragmentation is self-reinforcing, as new arrivals disturb only a few racks. MonkeyTree formulates defragmentation as an integer linear program that minimizes worker movements, subject to per-rack fragmentation bounds. We prove a tight bound showing any placement can be defragmented to at most two cross-rack fragments per ToR, and extend the formulation to hybrid parallelism with multiple rings per server. Migration is implemented via in-memory checkpoint-and-restore over RDMA, incurring only 9.02 seconds of system overhead end-to-end per worker. We evaluate MonkeyTree using a custom simulator modeling clusters of up to 2,048 H200 GPUs and prototype on a five-node A100 testbed. MonkeyTree improves average job completion time by 14 percent over the next best baseline on a cluster of 1,024 GPUs with a 4:1 oversubscription. With a high 16:1 oversubscription ratio and 2,048 GPUs, MonkeyTree keeps p99 job completion time within 5 percent of ideal.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |

Unlike text-to-video models, existing I2V pipelines often suffer from appearance drift and geometric distortion, artifacts we attribute to the sparsity of single-view 2D observations and weak cross-modal alignment. Here we address this problem from both data and model perspectives. First, we curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale object-centric dataset built with a scalable pipeline for high-quality, temporally aligned videos, and establish ConsIDVid-Bench, where we present a novel benchmarking and evaluation framework for multi-view consistency using metrics sensitive to subtle geometric and appearance deviations. We further propose ConsID-Gen, a view-assisted I2V generation framework that augments the first frame with unposed auxiliary views and fuses semantic and structural cues via a dual-stream visual-geometric encoder as well as a text-visual connector, yielding unified conditioning for a Diffusion Transformer backbone. Experiments across ConsIDVid-Bench demonstrate that ConsID-Gen consistently outperforms in multiple metrics, with the best overall performance surpassing leading video generation models like Wan2.1 and HunyuanVideo, delivering superior identity fidelity and temporal coherence under challenging real-world scenarios. We will release our model and dataset at https://myangwu.github.io/ConsID-Gen.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://myangwu.github.io/ConsID-Gen</p></details> |

This work presents VideoWorld 2, which extends VideoWorld and offers the first investigation into learning transferable knowledge directly from raw real-world videos. At its core, VideoWorld 2 introduces a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM) that decouples action dynamics from visual appearance: a pretrained video diffusion model handles visual appearance modeling, enabling the dLDM to learn latent codes that focus on compact and meaningful task-related dynamics. These latent codes are then modeled autoregressively to learn task policies and support long-horizon reasoning. We evaluate VideoWorld 2 on challenging real-world handcraft making tasks, where prior video generation and latent-dynamics models struggle to operate reliably. Remarkably, VideoWorld 2 achieves up to 70% improvement in task success rate and produces coherent long execution videos. In robotics, we show that VideoWorld 2 can acquire effective manipulation knowledge from the Open-X dataset, which substantially improves task performance on CALVIN. This study reveals the potential of learning transferable world knowledge directly from raw videos, with all code, data, and models to be open-sourced for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models are released at: https://maverickren.github.io/VideoWorld2.github.io/</p></details> |

However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge.

| **[Causality in Video Diffusers is Separable from Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10095v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causality -- referring to temporal, uni-directional cause-effect relationships between components -- underlies many complex generative processes, including videos, language, and robot trajectories. Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on both pretraining and post-training tasks across synthetic and real benchmarks show that SCD significantly improves throughput and per-frame latency while matching or surpassing the generation quality of strong causal diffusion baselines.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed reference images to construct a complete story, our approach features a novel external iterative paradigm, extending beyond the internal iterative denoising steps of diffusion models, to continuously refine each generated image by incorporating all reference images from the previous round. To achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play, training-free global reference cross-attention (GRCA) module, modeling all reference frames with global embeddings, ensuring semantic consistency in long sequences. By progressively incorporating holistic visual context and text constraints, our iterative paradigm enables precise generation with fine-grained interactions, optimizing the story visualization step-by-step. Extensive experiments in the official story visualization dataset and our long story benchmark demonstrate that Story-Iter's state-of-the-art performance in long-story visualization (up to 100 frames) excels in both semantic consistency and fine-grained interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 33 figures, The project page and associated code can be accessed via https://jwmao1.github.io/storyiter/</p></details> |
| **[Variational Sparse Paired Autoencoders (vsPAIR) for Inverse Problems and Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02948v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse problems are fundamental to many scientific and engineering disciplines; they arise when one seeks to reconstruct hidden, underlying quantities from noisy measurements. Many applications demand not just point estimates but interpretable uncertainty. Providing fast inference alongside uncertainty estimates remains challenging yet desirable in numerous applications. We propose the Variational Sparse Paired Autoencoder (vsPAIR) to address this challenge. The architecture pairs a standard VAE encoding observations with a sparse VAE encoding quantities of interest, connected through a learned latent mapping. The variational structure enables uncertainty estimation, the paired architecture encourages interpretability by anchoring QoI representations to clean data, and sparse encodings provide structure by concentrating information into identifiable factors rather than diffusing across all dimensions. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture, we conduct experiments on blind inpainting and computed tomography, demonstrating that vsPAIR is a capable inverse problem solver that can provide interpretable and structured uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima. These geometric properties explain why bAE+FMQA improves the approximation ratio faster while maintaining feasibility throughout optimization, and they provide guidance for designing latent representations for black-box optimization.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in autonomous coordination, its resilience under sudden node failures remains a challenge due to dynamic topology deformation. This paper proposes a Topology-Aware Graph MAPPO (TAG-MAPPO) framework designed to enhance system survivability through autonomous 3D spatial reconfiguration. Our framework incorporates graph-based feature aggregation with a residual ego-state fusion mechanism to capture intricate inter-agent dependencies. This architecture enables the surviving swarm to rapidly adapt its topology compared to conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based approaches. Extensive simulations across heterogeneous environments, ranging from interference-limited Crowded Urban to sparse Rural areas, validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that TAG-MAPPO consistently outperforms baselines in both stability and efficiency; specifically, it reduces redundant handoffs by up to 50 percent while maintaining a lead in energy efficiency. Most notably, the framework exhibits exceptional self-healing capabilities following a catastrophic node failure. TAG-MAPPO restores over 90 percent of the pre-failure service coverage within 15 time steps, exhibiting a significantly faster V-shaped recovery trajectory than MLP baselines. Furthermore, in dense urban scenarios, the framework achieves a post-failure Jain's Fairness Index that even surpasses its original four-UAV configuration by effectively resolving service overlaps.

However, these design choices require significant data and computational resources and remain far from reliable, particularly within the context of multi-fingered dexterous manipulation. Fundamentally, they model skills as reactive mappings and rely on fixed-horizon action chunking to mitigate jitter, creating a rigid trade-off between temporal coherence and reactivity. In this work, we introduce Unified Behavioral Models (UBMs), a framework that learns to represent dexterous skills as coupled dynamical systems that capture how visual features of the environment (visual flow) and proprioceptive states of the robot (action flow) co-evolve. By capturing such behavioral dynamics, UBMs can ensure temporal coherence by construction rather than by heuristic averaging. To operationalize these models, we propose Koopman-UBM, a first instantiation of UBMs that leverages Koopman Operator theory to effectively learn a unified representation in which the joint flow of latent visual and proprioceptive features is governed by a structured linear system. We demonstrate that Koopman-UBM can be viewed as an implicit planner: given an initial condition, it computes the desired robot behavior with the resulting flow of visual features over the entire skill horizon. To enable reactivity, we introduce an online replanning strategy in which the model acts as its own runtime monitor that automatically triggers replanning when predicted and observed visual flow diverge. Across seven simulated and two real-world tasks, we demonstrate that K-UBM matches or exceeds the performance of SOTA baselines, while offering faster inference, smooth execution, robustness to occlusions, and flexible replanning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes can be found at https://github.com/GT-STAR-Lab/K-UBM/</p></details> |

Our goal is to consolidating the landscape of multimodal chunking strategies, providing researchers and practitioners with a technical foundation and design space for developing more effective and efficient multimodal AI systems. This survey paves the way for innovations in robust chunking pipelines that scale with modality complexity, enhance processing accuracy, and improve generative coherence in real-world applications. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy and technical analysis of chunking strategies tailored for each modality: text, images, audio, video, and cross-modal data. We examine classical and modern approaches such as fixed-size token windowing, recursive text splitting, object-centric visual chunking, silence-based audio segmentation, and scene detection in videos. Each approach is analyzed in terms of its underlying methodology, supporting tools (e.g., LangChain, Detectron2, PySceneDetect), benefits, and challenges, particularly those related to granularity-context trade-offs and multimodal alignment. Furthermore, we explore emerging cross-modal chunking strategies that aim to preserve alignment and semantic consistency across disparate data types [4]. We also include comparative insights, highlight open problems such as asynchronous information density and noisy alignment signals, and identify opportunities for future research in adaptive, learning-based, and task-specific chunking.</p></details> | 50 pages, 5 figure |

As cloud operators co-locate ML training jobs on shared, oversubscribed networks, congestion degrades training throughput for over a third of jobs. Prior approaches either rely on routing and flow scheduling--which we show have fundamental limits when traffic exceeds capacity--or require costly full-bisection bandwidth topologies with packet spraying. MonkeyTree exploits characteristics of ML training traffic: ring-based collectives generate exactly one cross-rack flow per rack a job spans, making congestion-free placements achievable. The sparse constraint structure admits abundant valid configurations, making them easy to reach with few migrations. Once reached, low fragmentation is self-reinforcing, as new arrivals disturb only a few racks. MonkeyTree formulates defragmentation as an integer linear program that minimizes worker movements, subject to per-rack fragmentation bounds. We prove a tight bound showing any placement can be defragmented to at most two cross-rack fragments per ToR, and extend the formulation to hybrid parallelism with multiple rings per server. Migration is implemented via in-memory checkpoint-and-restore over RDMA, incurring only 9.02 seconds of system overhead end-to-end per worker. We evaluate MonkeyTree using a custom simulator modeling clusters of up to 2,048 H200 GPUs and prototype on a five-node A100 testbed. MonkeyTree improves average job completion time by 14 percent over the next best baseline on a cluster of 1,024 GPUs with a 4:1 oversubscription. With a high 16:1 oversubscription ratio and 2,048 GPUs, MonkeyTree keeps p99 job completion time within 5 percent of ideal.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |

Over six months in 2023-2024, GenAI-based enhancements were integrated into seven consumer-facing business workflows. We find that GenAI adoption significantly increases sales, with treatment effects ranging from $0\%$ to $16.3\%$, depending on GenAI's marginal contribution relative to existing firm practices. Because inputs and prices were held constant across experimental arms, these gains map directly into total factor productivity improvements. Across the four GenAI applications with positive sales effects, the implied annual incremental value is approximately $\$ 5$ per consumer-an economically meaningful impact given the retailer's scale and the early stage of GenAI adoption. The primary mechanism operates through higher conversion rates, consistent with GenAI reducing frictions and improving consumer experience. Importantly, these effects are not associated with worse post-purchase outcomes, as product return rates and customer ratings do not deteriorate. Finally, we document substantial demand-side heterogeneity, with larger gains for less experienced consumers. Our findings provide novel, large-scale causal evidence on the productivity effects of GenAI in online retail, highlighting both its immediate value and broader potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Field Experiments, Generative AI, Productivity, Retail Platforms, Consumer Experience.

Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima. These geometric properties explain why bAE+FMQA improves the approximation ratio faster while maintaining feasibility throughout optimization, and they provide guidance for designing latent representations for black-box optimization.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in autonomous coordination, its resilience under sudden node failures remains a challenge due to dynamic topology deformation. This paper proposes a Topology-Aware Graph MAPPO (TAG-MAPPO) framework designed to enhance system survivability through autonomous 3D spatial reconfiguration. Our framework incorporates graph-based feature aggregation with a residual ego-state fusion mechanism to capture intricate inter-agent dependencies. This architecture enables the surviving swarm to rapidly adapt its topology compared to conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based approaches. Extensive simulations across heterogeneous environments, ranging from interference-limited Crowded Urban to sparse Rural areas, validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that TAG-MAPPO consistently outperforms baselines in both stability and efficiency; specifically, it reduces redundant handoffs by up to 50 percent while maintaining a lead in energy efficiency. Most notably, the framework exhibits exceptional self-healing capabilities following a catastrophic node failure. TAG-MAPPO restores over 90 percent of the pre-failure service coverage within 15 time steps, exhibiting a significantly faster V-shaped recovery trajectory than MLP baselines. Furthermore, in dense urban scenarios, the framework achieves a post-failure Jain's Fairness Index that even surpasses its original four-UAV configuration by effectively resolving service overlaps. These findings suggest that topology-aware coordination is essential for the realization of resilient 6G aerial networks and provides a robust foundation for adaptive deployments in volatile environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures.

Motivated by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and preliminary gray-box results, we hypothesized that KANs would enable efficient recovery of unknown terms compared to MLPs. Through initial sensitivity analysis on configuration sensitivity, parameter scale, and training paradigm, we found that while small KANs are competitive on univariate polynomial residuals (Duffing), they exhibit severe hyperparameter fragility, instability in deeper configurations, and consistent failure on multiplicative terms (Van der Pol), generally outperformed by standard MLPs. These empirical challenges highlight limitations of the additive inductive bias in the original KAN formulation for state coupling and provide preliminary empirical evidence of inductive bias limitations for future hybrid modeling.</p></details> | 5 pages |

In these scenarios, the continuous mapping from parameters to solutions can result in spectral bias or "mode collapse", where the network averages distinct physical behaviors. We propose a Topology-Aware PINN (TAPINN) that aims to mitigate this challenge by structuring the latent space via Supervised Metric Regularization. Unlike standard parametric PINNs that map physical parameters directly to solutions, our method conditions the solver on a latent state optimized to reflect the metric-based separation between regimes, showing ~49% lower physics residual (0.082 vs. 0.160). We train this architecture using a phase-based Alternating Optimization (AO) schedule to manage gradient conflicts between the metric and physics objectives. Preliminary experiments on the Duffing Oscillator demonstrate that while standard baselines suffer from spectral bias and high-capacity Hypernetworks overfit (memorizing data while violating physics), our approach achieves stable convergence with 2.18x lower gradient variance than a multi-output Sobolev Error baseline, and 5x fewer parameters than a hypernetwork-based alternative.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

However, efficiently deploying UAV-BSs to satisfy heterogeneous user distributions remains a challenging optimization problem. While recent data-driven approaches, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), have shown promise in dynamic environments, they often suffer from prohibitive training overhead, poor generalization to topology changes, and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Satisfaction-driven Coverage Optimization via Perimeter Extraction (SCOPE), a training-free and online 3D deployment framework. Unlike heuristic baselines that rely on fixed-altitude assumptions, SCOPE integrates a perimeter extraction mechanism with the Smallest Enclosing Circle (SEC) algorithm to dynamically optimize 3D UAV positions. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous convergence proof of the proposed algorithm and derive its polynomial time complexity of $O(N^2 \log N)$. Experimentally, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study against state-of-the-art DRL baselines (e.g., PPO). Simulation results demonstrate that SCOPE achieves comparable user satisfaction to DRL methods but significantly lower computational latency (milliseconds vs. hours of training) and superior energy efficiency, making it an ideal solution for real-time, on-demand emergency deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, Full research paper providing a training-free determinisitc 3D UAV deployment algorithm, SCOPE.

Effective recognition, reasoning, and editing often require not only forming such compositional representations, but also solving the decomposition problem. One popular choice for constructing these representations is through the binding operation. Resonator networks, which can be understood as coupled Hopfield networks, were proposed as a way to perform decomposition on such bound representations. Recent works have shown notable similarities between Hopfield networks and diffusion models. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a framework for semantic decomposition using coupled inference in diffusion models. Our method frames semantic decomposition as an inverse problem and couples the diffusion processes using a reconstruction-driven guidance term that encourages the composition of factor estimates to match the bound vector. We also introduce a novel iterative sampling scheme that improves the performance of our model. Finally, we show that attention-based resonator networks are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our coupled inference framework outperforms resonator networks across a range of synthetic semantic decomposition tasks.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Our experiments demonstrate that Faster-GS achieves up to 5$\times$ faster training while maintaining visual quality, establishing a new cost-effective and resource efficient baseline for 3DGS optimization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizations can be applied to 4D Gaussian reconstruction, leading to efficient non-rigid scene optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://fhahlbohm.github.io/faster-gaussian-splatting</p></details> |

Motivated by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and preliminary gray-box results, we hypothesized that KANs would enable efficient recovery of unknown terms compared to MLPs. Through initial sensitivity analysis on configuration sensitivity, parameter scale, and training paradigm, we found that while small KANs are competitive on univariate polynomial residuals (Duffing), they exhibit severe hyperparameter fragility, instability in deeper configurations, and consistent failure on multiplicative terms (Van der Pol), generally outperformed by standard MLPs. These empirical challenges highlight limitations of the additive inductive bias in the original KAN formulation for state coupling and provide preliminary empirical evidence of inductive bias limitations for future hybrid modeling.</p></details> | 5 pages |

In these scenarios, the continuous mapping from parameters to solutions can result in spectral bias or "mode collapse", where the network averages distinct physical behaviors. We propose a Topology-Aware PINN (TAPINN) that aims to mitigate this challenge by structuring the latent space via Supervised Metric Regularization. Unlike standard parametric PINNs that map physical parameters directly to solutions, our method conditions the solver on a latent state optimized to reflect the metric-based separation between regimes, showing ~49% lower physics residual (0.082 vs. 0.160). We train this architecture using a phase-based Alternating Optimization (AO) schedule to manage gradient conflicts between the metric and physics objectives. Preliminary experiments on the Duffing Oscillator demonstrate that while standard baselines suffer from spectral bias and high-capacity Hypernetworks overfit (memorizing data while violating physics), our approach achieves stable convergence with 2.18x lower gradient variance than a multi-output Sobolev Error baseline, and 5x fewer parameters than a hypernetwork-based alternative.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

However, efficiently deploying UAV-BSs to satisfy heterogeneous user distributions remains a challenging optimization problem. While recent data-driven approaches, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), have shown promise in dynamic environments, they often suffer from prohibitive training overhead, poor generalization to topology changes, and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Satisfaction-driven Coverage Optimization via Perimeter Extraction (SCOPE), a training-free and online 3D deployment framework. Unlike heuristic baselines that rely on fixed-altitude assumptions, SCOPE integrates a perimeter extraction mechanism with the Smallest Enclosing Circle (SEC) algorithm to dynamically optimize 3D UAV positions. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous convergence proof of the proposed algorithm and derive its polynomial time complexity of $O(N^2 \log N)$. Experimentally, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study against state-of-the-art DRL baselines (e.g., PPO). Simulation results demonstrate that SCOPE achieves comparable user satisfaction to DRL methods but significantly lower computational latency (milliseconds vs. hours of training) and superior energy efficiency, making it an ideal solution for real-time, on-demand emergency deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, Full research paper providing a training-free determinisitc 3D UAV deployment algorithm, SCOPE.

While initially developed for unimodal (primarily textual) domains, recent advances in multimodal foundation models have extended chunking approaches to incorporate diverse data types, including images, audio, and video [2]. A critical component underpinning the success of these systems is the chunking strategy how large, continuous streams of multimodal data are segmented into semantically meaningful units suitable for processing [3]. Despite its importance, chunking remains an under-explored area, especially in the context of multimodal systems where modality-specific constraints, semantic preservation, and alignment across modalities introduce unique challenges. Our goal is to consolidating the landscape of multimodal chunking strategies, providing researchers and practitioners with a technical foundation and design space for developing more effective and efficient multimodal AI systems. This survey paves the way for innovations in robust chunking pipelines that scale with modality complexity, enhance processing accuracy, and improve generative coherence in real-world applications. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy and technical analysis of chunking strategies tailored for each modality: text, images, audio, video, and cross-modal data. We examine classical and modern approaches such as fixed-size token windowing, recursive text splitting, object-centric visual chunking, silence-based audio segmentation, and scene detection in videos. Each approach is analyzed in terms of its underlying methodology, supporting tools (e.g., LangChain, Detectron2, PySceneDetect), benefits, and challenges, particularly those related to granularity-context trade-offs and multimodal alignment. Furthermore, we explore emerging cross-modal chunking strategies that aim to preserve alignment and semantic consistency across disparate data types [4]. We also include comparative insights, highlight open problems such as asynchronous information density and noisy alignment signals, and identify opportunities for future research in adaptive, learning-based, and task-specific chunking.</p></details> | 50 pages, 5 figure |

As cloud operators co-locate ML training jobs on shared, oversubscribed networks, congestion degrades training throughput for over a third of jobs. Prior approaches either rely on routing and flow scheduling--which we show have fundamental limits when traffic exceeds capacity--or require costly full-bisection bandwidth topologies with packet spraying. MonkeyTree exploits characteristics of ML training traffic: ring-based collectives generate exactly one cross-rack flow per rack a job spans, making congestion-free placements achievable. The sparse constraint structure admits abundant valid configurations, making them easy to reach with few migrations. Once reached, low fragmentation is self-reinforcing, as new arrivals disturb only a few racks. MonkeyTree formulates defragmentation as an integer linear program that minimizes worker movements, subject to per-rack fragmentation bounds. We prove a tight bound showing any placement can be defragmented to at most two cross-rack fragments per ToR, and extend the formulation to hybrid parallelism with multiple rings per server. Migration is implemented via in-memory checkpoint-and-restore over RDMA, incurring only 9.02 seconds of system overhead end-to-end per worker. We evaluate MonkeyTree using a custom simulator modeling clusters of up to 2,048 H200 GPUs and prototype on a five-node A100 testbed. MonkeyTree improves average job completion time by 14 percent over the next best baseline on a cluster of 1,024 GPUs with a 4:1 oversubscription. With a high 16:1 oversubscription ratio and 2,048 GPUs, MonkeyTree keeps p99 job completion time within 5 percent of ideal.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |

Over six months in 2023-2024, GenAI-based enhancements were integrated into seven consumer-facing business workflows. We find that GenAI adoption significantly increases sales, with treatment effects ranging from $0\%$ to $16.3\%$, depending on GenAI's marginal contribution relative to existing firm practices. Because inputs and prices were held constant across experimental arms, these gains map directly into total factor productivity improvements. Across the four GenAI applications with positive sales effects, the implied annual incremental value is approximately $\$ 5$ per consumer-an economically meaningful impact given the retailer's scale and the early stage of GenAI adoption. The primary mechanism operates through higher conversion rates, consistent with GenAI reducing frictions and improving consumer experience. Importantly, these effects are not associated with worse post-purchase outcomes, as product return rates and customer ratings do not deteriorate. Finally, we document substantial demand-side heterogeneity, with larger gains for less experienced consumers. Our findings provide novel, large-scale causal evidence on the productivity effects of GenAI in online retail, highlighting both its immediate value and broader potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Field Experiments, Generative AI, Productivity, Retail Platforms, Consumer Experience.

| **[Effectiveness of Binary Autoencoders for QUBO-Based Optimization Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10037v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In black-box combinatorial optimization, objective evaluations are often expensive, so high quality solutions must be found under a limited budget. Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima. These geometric properties explain why bAE+FMQA improves the approximation ratio faster while maintaining feasibility throughout optimization, and they provide guidance for designing latent representations for black-box optimization.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in autonomous coordination, its resilience under sudden node failures remains a challenge due to dynamic topology deformation. This paper proposes a Topology-Aware Graph MAPPO (TAG-MAPPO) framework designed to enhance system survivability through autonomous 3D spatial reconfiguration. Our framework incorporates graph-based feature aggregation with a residual ego-state fusion mechanism to capture intricate inter-agent dependencies. This architecture enables the surviving swarm to rapidly adapt its topology compared to conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based approaches. Extensive simulations across heterogeneous environments, ranging from interference-limited Crowded Urban to sparse Rural areas, validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that TAG-MAPPO consistently outperforms baselines in both stability and efficiency; specifically, it reduces redundant handoffs by up to 50 percent while maintaining a lead in energy efficiency. Most notably, the framework exhibits exceptional self-healing capabilities following a catastrophic node failure. TAG-MAPPO restores over 90 percent of the pre-failure service coverage within 15 time steps, exhibiting a significantly faster V-shaped recovery trajectory than MLP baselines. Furthermore, in dense urban scenarios, the framework achieves a post-failure Jain's Fairness Index that even surpasses its original four-UAV configuration by effectively resolving service overlaps. These findings suggest that topology-aware coordination is essential for the realization of resilient 6G aerial networks and provides a robust foundation for adaptive deployments in volatile environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures.

However, many proposed methods entangle implementation-level improvements with fundamental algorithmic modifications or trade performance for fidelity, leading to a fragmented research landscape that complicates fair comparison. In this work, we consolidate and evaluate the most effective and broadly applicable strategies from prior 3DGS research and augment them with several novel optimizations. We further investigate underexplored aspects of the framework, including numerical stability, Gaussian truncation, and gradient approximation. The resulting system, Faster-GS, provides a rigorously optimized algorithm that we evaluate across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks.
