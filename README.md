| **[Deep-Learning Investigation of Vibrational Raman Spectra for Plant-Stress Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15772v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting stress in plants is crucial for both open-farm and controlled-environment agriculture. Biomolecules within plants serve as key stress indicators, offering vital markers for continuous health monitoring and early disease detection. Raman spectroscopy provides a powerful, non-invasive means to quantify these biomolecules through their molecular vibrational signatures. However, traditional Raman analysis relies on customized data-processing workflows that require fluorescence background removal and prior identification of Raman peaks of interest-introducing potential biases and inconsistencies. Here, we introduce DIVA (Deep-learning-based Investigation of Vibrational Raman spectra for plant-stress Analysis), a fully automated workflow based on a variational autoencoder. Unlike conventional approaches, DIVA processes native Raman spectra-including fluorescence backgrounds-without manual preprocessing, identifying and quantifying significant spectral features in an unbiased manner. We applied DIVA to detect a range of plant stresses, including abiotic (shading, high light intensity, high temperature) and biotic stressors (bacterial infections). By integrating deep learning with vibrational spectroscopy, DIVA paves the way for AI-driven plant health assessment, fostering more resilient and sustainable agricultural practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>*Auth...</summary><p>*Authors contributed equally to this work. +Supervised this work. 5 main figures and 1 extended data figure in manuscript.

| **[The added value for MRI radiomics and deep-learning for glioblastoma prognostication compared to clinical and molecular information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15548v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Radiomics shows promise in characterizing glioblastoma, but its added value over clinical and molecular predictors has yet to be proven. This study assessed the added value of conventional radiomics (CR) and deep learning (DL) MRI radiomics for glioblastoma prognosis (<= 6 vs > 6 months survival) on a large multi-center dataset. Methods: After patient selection, our curated dataset gathers 1152 glioblastoma (WHO 2016) patients from five Swiss centers and one public source. It included clinical (age, gender), molecular (MGMT, IDH), and baseline MRI data (T1, T1 contrast, FLAIR, T2) with tumor regions. CR and DL models were developed using standard methods and evaluated on internal and external cohorts. Sub-analyses assessed models with different feature sets (imaging-only, clinical/molecular-only, combined-features) and patient subsets (S-1: all patients, S-2: with molecular data, S-3: IDH wildtype). Results: The best performance was observed in the full cohort (S-1). In external validation, the combined-feature CR model achieved an AUC of 0.75, slightly, but significantly outperforming clinical-only (0.74) and imaging-only (0.68) models. DL models showed similar trends, though without statistical significance. In S-2 and S-3, combined models did not outperform clinical-only models. Exploratory analysis of CR models for overall survival prediction suggested greater relevance of imaging data: across all subsets, combined-feature models significantly outperformed clinical-only models, though with a modest advantage of 2-4 C-index points. Conclusions: While confirming the predictive value of anatomical MRI sequences for glioblastoma prognosis, this multi-center study found standard CR and DL radiomics approaches offer minimal added value over demographic predictors such as age and gender.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Optimization for Molecules Should Be Pareto-Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13704v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) provides a principled framework for navigating trade-offs in molecular design. However, its empirical advantages over scalarized alternatives remain underexplored. We benchmark a simple Pareto-based MOBO strategy -- Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) -- against a simple fixed-weight scalarized baseline using Expected Improvement (EI), under a tightly controlled setup with identical Gaussian Process surrogates and molecular representations. Across three molecular optimization tasks, EHVI consistently outperforms scalarized EI in terms of Pareto front coverage, convergence speed, and chemical diversity. While scalarization encompasses flexible variants -- including random or adaptive schemes -- our results show that even strong deterministic instantiations can underperform in low-data regimes. These findings offer concrete evidence for the practical advantages of Pareto-aware acquisition in de novo molecular optimization, especially when evaluation budgets are limited and trade-offs are nontrivial.</p></details> |  |
| **[JAMUN: Bridging Smoothed Molecular Dynamics and Score-Based Learning for Conformational Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14621v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformational ensembles of protein structures are immensely important both for understanding protein function and drug discovery in novel modalities such as cryptic pockets. Current techniques for sampling ensembles such as molecular dynamics (MD) are computationally inefficient, while many recent machine learning methods do not transfer to systems outside their training data. We propose JAMUN which performs MD in a smoothed, noised space of all-atom 3D conformations of molecules by utilizing the framework of walk-jump sampling. JAMUN enables ensemble generation for small peptides at rates of an order of magnitude faster than traditional molecular dynamics. The physical priors in JAMUN enables transferability to systems outside of its training data, even to peptides that are longer than those originally trained on. Our model, code and weights are available at https://github.com/prescient-design/jamun.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, presented at GenBio workshop at ICML 2025, under review</p></details> |
| **[RetroDiff: Retrosynthesis as Multi-stage Distribution Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14077v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrosynthesis poses a key challenge in biopharmaceuticals, aiding chemists in finding appropriate reactant molecules for given product molecules. With reactants and products represented as 2D graphs, retrosynthesis constitutes a conditional graph-to-graph (G2G) generative task. Inspired by advancements in discrete diffusion models for graph generation, we aim to design a diffusion-based method to address this problem. However, integrating a diffusion-based G2G framework while retaining essential chemical reaction template information presents a notable challenge. Our key innovation involves a multi-stage diffusion process. We decompose the retrosynthesis procedure to first sample external groups from the dummy distribution given products, then generate external bonds to connect products and generated groups. Interestingly, this generation process mirrors the reverse of the widely adapted semi-template retrosynthesis workflow, \emph{i.e.} from reaction center identification to synthon completion. Based on these designs, we introduce Retrosynthesis Diffusion (RetroDiff), a novel diffusion-based method for the retrosynthesis task. Experimental results demonstrate that RetroDiff surpasses all semi-template methods in accuracy, and outperforms template-based and template-free methods in large-scale scenarios and molecular validity, respectively.

| **[BARNN: A Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18665v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive and recurrent networks have achieved remarkable progress across various fields, from weather forecasting to molecular generation and Large Language Models. Despite their strong predictive capabilities, these models lack a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty, which is key in scientific applications such as PDE solving, molecular generation and Machine Learning Force Fields. To address this shortcoming we present BARNN: a variational Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network. BARNNs aim to provide a principled way to turn any autoregressive or recurrent model into its Bayesian version. BARNN is based on the variational dropout method, allowing to apply it to large recurrent neural networks as well. We also introduce a temporal version of the "Variational Mixtures of Posteriors" prior (tVAMP-prior) to make Bayesian inference efficient and well-calibrated. Extensive experiments on PDE modelling and molecular generation demonstrate that BARNN not only achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, but also excels in uncertainty quantification and modelling long-range dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoDyGAN: Combining Molecular Dynamics With GANs to Investigate Protein Conformational Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13950v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensively exploring protein conformational landscapes remains a major challenge in computational biology due to the high computational cost involved in dynamic physics-based simulations. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational spaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into MD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble learning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of generated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative representation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into 2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use three rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new conformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that interpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that representing proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying advanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an efficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed framework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolPIF: A Parameter Interpolation Flow Model for Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13762v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space. However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore, the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design, demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for model design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computing and Bounding Equilibrium Concentrations in Athermic Chemical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12699v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing equilibrium concentrations of molecular complexes is generally analytically intractable and requires numerical approaches. In this work we focus on the polymer-monomer level, where indivisible molecules (monomers) combine to form complexes (polymers). Rather than employing free-energy parameters for each polymer, we focus on the athermic setting where all interactions preserve enthalpy. This setting aligns with the strongly bonded (domain-based) regime in DNA nanotechnology when strands can bind in different ways, but always with maximum overall bonding -- and is consistent with the saturated configurations in the Thermodynamic Binding Networks (TBNs) model. Within this context, we develop an iterative algorithm for assigning polymer concentrations to satisfy detailed-balance, where on-target (desired) polymers are in high concentrations and off-target (undesired) polymers are in low. Even if not directly executed, our algorithm provides effective insights into upper bounds on concentration of off-target polymers, connecting combinatorial arguments about discrete configurations such as those in the TBN model to real-valued concentrations. We conclude with an application of our method to decreasing leak in DNA logic and signal propagation. Our results offer a new framework for design and verification of equilibrium concentrations when configurations are distinguished by entropic forces.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in DNA31 (31st International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming)</p></details> |
| **[SynCoGen: Synthesizable 3D Molecule Generation via Joint Reaction and Coordinate Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11818v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring synthesizability in generative small molecule design remains a major challenge. While recent developments in synthesizable molecule generation have demonstrated promising results, these efforts have been largely confined to 2D molecular graph representations, limiting the ability to perform geometry-based conditional generation. In this work, we present SynCoGen (Synthesizable Co-Generation), a single framework that combines simultaneous masked graph diffusion and flow matching for synthesizable 3D molecule generation. SynCoGen samples from the joint distribution of molecular building blocks, chemical reactions, and atomic coordinates. To train the model, we curated SynSpace, a dataset containing over 600K synthesis-aware building block graphs and 3.3M conformers. SynCoGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional small molecule graph and conformer generation, and the model delivers competitive performance in zero-shot molecular linker design for protein ligand generation in drug discovery. Overall, this multimodal formulation represents a foundation for future applications enabled by non-autoregressive molecular generation, including analog expansion, lead optimization, and direct structure conditioning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Torsional-GFN: a conditional conformation generator for small molecules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11759v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating stable molecular conformations is crucial in several drug discovery applications, such as estimating the binding affinity of a molecule to a target. Recently, generative machine learning methods have emerged as a promising, more efficient method than molecular dynamics for sampling of conformations from the Boltzmann distribution. In this paper, we introduce Torsional-GFN, a conditional GFlowNet specifically designed to sample conformations of molecules proportionally to their Boltzmann distribution, using only a reward function as training signal. Conditioned on a molecular graph and its local structure (bond lengths and angles), Torsional-GFN samples rotations of its torsion angles. Our results demonstrate that Torsional-GFN is able to sample conformations approximately proportional to the Boltzmann distribution for multiple molecules with a single model, and allows for zero-shot generalization to unseen bond lengths and angles coming from the MD simulations for such molecules. Our work presents a promising avenue for scaling the proposed approach to larger molecular systems, achieving zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules, and including the generation of the local structure into the GFlowNet model.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The two first authors are Alexandra Volokhova and L\'ena N\'ehale Ezzine, with equal contribution</p></details> |
| **[Acquiring and Adapting Priors for Novel Tasks via Neural Meta-Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10446v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to transfer knowledge from prior experiences to novel tasks stands as a pivotal capability of intelligent agents, including both humans and computational models. This principle forms the basis of transfer learning, where large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream tasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of task adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where, due to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational models is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational immunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our work focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of priors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we demonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on non-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that our hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire more generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene generation, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a handful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We then extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel scenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed scenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a pre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction, addressing critical challenges in computational immunology.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.17075</p></details> |
| **[TextOmics-Guided Diffusion for Hit-like Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09982v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hit-like molecular generation with therapeutic potential is essential for target-specific drug discovery. However, the field lacks heterogeneous data and unified frameworks for integrating diverse molecular representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TextOmics, a pioneering benchmark that establishes one-to-one correspondences between omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions. TextOmics provides a heterogeneous dataset that facilitates molecular generation through representations alignment. Built upon this foundation, we propose ToDi, a generative framework that jointly conditions on omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions to produce biologically relevant, chemically valid, hit-like molecules. ToDi leverages two encoders (OmicsEn and TextEn) to capture multi-level biological and semantic associations, and develops conditional diffusion (DiffGen) for controllable generation. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of TextOmics and demonstrate ToDi outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, while also showcasing remarkable potential in zero-shot therapeutic molecular generation.

| **[Efficient Molecular Conformer Generation with SO(3)-Averaged Flow Matching and Reflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09785v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast and accurate generation of molecular conformers is desired for downstream computational chemistry and drug discovery tasks. Currently, training and sampling state-of-the-art diffusion or flow-based models for conformer generation require significant computational resources. In this work, we build upon flow-matching and propose two mechanisms for accelerating training and inference of generative models for 3D molecular conformer generation. For fast training, we introduce the SO(3)-Averaged Flow training objective, which leads to faster convergence to better generation quality compared to conditional optimal transport flow or Kabsch-aligned flow. We demonstrate that models trained using SO(3)-Averaged Flow can reach state-of-the-art conformer generation quality. For fast inference, we show that the reflow and distillation methods of flow-based models enable few-steps or even one-step molecular conformer generation with high quality. The training techniques proposed in this work show a path towards highly efficient molecular conformer generation with flow-based models.</p></details> | ICML 2025 poster |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v3)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning-Order Autoregressive Models with Application to Molecular Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05979v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models (ARMs) have become the workhorse for sequence generation tasks, since many problems can be modeled as next-token prediction. While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an order-policy, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation. On the challenging domain of molecular graph generation, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k benchmarks, evaluated across key metrics for distribution similarity and drug-likeless.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shortening the Trajectories: Identity-Aware Gaussian Approximation for Efficient 3D Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09043v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian-based Probabilistic Generative Models (GPGMs) generate data by reversing a stochastic process that progressively corrupts samples with Gaussian noise. While these models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, their practical deployment remains constrained by the high computational cost of long generative trajectories, which often involve hundreds to thousands of steps during training and sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretically grounded and empirically validated framework that improves generation efficiency without sacrificing training granularity or inference fidelity. Our key insight is that for certain data modalities, the noising process causes data to rapidly lose its identity and converge toward a Gaussian distribution. We analytically identify a characteristic step at which the data has acquired sufficient Gaussianity, and then replace the remaining generation trajectory with a closed-form Gaussian approximation. Unlike existing acceleration techniques that coarsening the trajectories by skipping steps, our method preserves the full resolution of learning dynamics while avoiding redundant stochastic perturbations between `Gaussian-like' distributions. Empirical results across multiple data modalities demonstrate substantial improvements in both sample quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting and generating antibiotics against future pathogens with ApexOracle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07862v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities, ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature" molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future infectious-disease outbreaks.</p></details> | 3 figures |
| **[Synthetic MC via Biological Transmitters: Therapeutic Modulation of the Gut-Brain Axis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07604v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However, generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices, poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal, safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA modulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MODA: A Unified 3D Diffusion Framework for Multi-Task Target-Aware Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07201v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional molecular generators based on diffusion models can now reach near-crystallographic accuracy, yet they remain fragmented across tasks. SMILES-only inputs, two-stage pretrain-finetune pipelines, and one-task-one-model practices hinder stereochemical fidelity, task alignment, and zero-shot transfer. We introduce MODA, a diffusion framework that unifies fragment growing, linker design, scaffold hopping, and side-chain decoration with a Bayesian mask scheduler. During training, a contiguous spatial fragment is masked and then denoised in one pass, enabling the model to learn shared geometric and chemical priors across tasks. Multi-task training yields a universal backbone that surpasses six diffusion baselines and three training paradigms on substructure, chemical property, interaction, and geometry. Model-C reduces ligand-protein clashes and substructure divergences while maintaining Lipinski compliance, whereas Model-B preserves similarity but trails in novelty and binding affinity. Zero-shot de novo design and lead-optimisation tests confirm stable negative Vina scores and high improvement rates without force-field refinement. These results demonstrate that a single-stage multi-task diffusion routine can replace two-stage workflows for structure-based molecular design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Implementation of Gaussian Process Regression Accelerated Saddle Point Searches with Application to Molecular Reactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12519v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of locating first order saddle points on high-dimensional surfaces describing the variation of energy as a function of atomic coordinates is an essential step for identifying the mechanism and estimating the rate of thermally activated events within the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. When combined directly with electronic structure calculations, the number of energy and atomic force evaluations needed for convergence is a primary issue. Here, we describe an efficient implementation of Gaussian process regression (GPR) acceleration of the minimum mode following method where a dimer is used to estimate the lowest eigenmode of the Hessian. A surrogate energy surface is constructed and updated after each electronic structure calculation. The method is applied to a test set of 500 molecular reactions previously generated by Hermez and coworkers [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 18, 6974 (2022)]. An order of magnitude reduction in the number of electronic structure calculations needed to reach the saddle point configurations is obtained by using the GPR compared to the dimer method. Despite the wide range in stiffness of the molecular degrees of freedom, the calculations are carried out using Cartesian coordinates and are found to require similar number of electronic structure calculations as an elaborate internal coordinate method implemented in the Sella software package. The present implementation of the GPR surrogate model in C++ is efficient enough for the wall time of the saddle point searches to be reduced in 3 out of 4 cases even though the calculations are carried out at a low Hartree-Fock level.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Graph Attention Specialized Expert Fusion Model for Node Classification: Based on Cora and Pubmed Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15784v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph node classification is a fundamental task in graph neural networks (GNNs), aiming to assign predefined class labels to nodes. On the PubMed citation network dataset, we observe significant classification difficulty disparities, with Category 2 achieving only 74.4% accuracy in traditional GCN, 7.5% lower than Category 1. To address this, we propose a Wasserstein-Rubinstein (WR) distance enhanced Expert Fusion Model (WR-EFM), training specialized GNN models for Categories 0/1 (with layer normalization and residual connections) and Multi-hop Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for Category 2. The WR distance metric optimizes representation similarity between models, particularly focusing on improving Category 2 performance. Our adaptive fusion strategy dynamically weights models based on category-specific performance, with Category 2 assigned a GAT weight of 0.8. WR distance further guides the fusion process by measuring distributional differences between model representations, enabling more principled integration of complementary features. Experimental results show WR-EFM achieves balanced accuracy across categories: 77.8% (Category 0), 78.0% (Category 1), and 79.9% (Category 2), outperforming both single models and standard fusion approaches. The coefficient of variation (CV) of WR-EFM's category accuracies is 0.013, 77.6% lower than GCN's 0.058, demonstrating superior stability. Notably, WR-EFM improves Category 2 accuracy by 5.5% compared to GCN, verifying the effectiveness of WR-guided fusion in capturing complex structural patterns. This work provides a novel paradigm for handling class-imbalanced graph classification tasks. To promote the research community, we release our project at https://github.com/s010m00n/GASEM4NC.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrainNetMLP: An Efficient and Effective Baseline for Functional Brain Network Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11538v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have made great progress in functional brain network classification by modeling the brain as a network of Regions of Interest (ROIs) and leveraging their connections to understand brain functionality and diagnose mental disorders. Various deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, and the recent Transformer, have been developed. However, despite the increasing complexity of these models, the performance gain has not been as salient. This raises a question: Does increasing model complexity necessarily lead to higher classification accuracy? In this paper, we revisit the simplest deep learning architecture, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and propose a pure MLP-based method, named BrainNetMLP, for functional brain network classification, which capitalizes on the advantages of MLP, including efficient computation and fewer parameters. Moreover, BrainNetMLP incorporates a dual-branch structure to jointly capture both spatial connectivity and spectral information, enabling precise spatiotemporal feature fusion. We evaluate our proposed BrainNetMLP on two public and popular brain network classification datasets, the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE).

| **[Proficient Graph Neural Network Design by Accumulating Knowledge on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06717v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level automation is increasingly critical in AI, driven by rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. However, LLMs, despite their general reasoning power, struggle significantly in specialized, data-sensitive tasks such as designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This difficulty arises from (1) the inherent knowledge gaps in modeling the intricate, varying relationships between graph properties and suitable architectures and (2) the external noise from misleading descriptive inputs, often resulting in generic or even misleading model suggestions. Achieving proficiency in designing data-aware models -- defined as the meta-level capability to systematically accumulate, interpret, and apply data-specific design knowledge -- remains challenging for existing automated approaches, due to their inefficient construction and application of meta-knowledge. To achieve the meta-level proficiency, we propose DesiGNN, a knowledge-centered framework that systematically converts past model design experiences into structured, fine-grained knowledge priors well fitted to meta-learning with LLMs. To account for the inherent variability and external noise, DesiGNN aligns empirical property filtering from extensive benchmarks with adaptive elicitation of literature insights via LLMs. By constructing a solid meta-knowledge between unseen graph understanding and known effective architecture patterns, DesiGNN can deliver top-5.77% initial model proposals for unseen datasets within seconds, and achieve consistently superior performance with minimal search costs against baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Mode-Driven Graph Convolutional Network for Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16191v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on spatiotemporal (ST) traffic prediction using graph neural networks (GNNs). Given that ST data comprises non-stationary and complex temporal patterns, interpreting and predicting such trends is inherently challenging. Representing ST data in decomposed modes helps infer underlying behavior and assess the impact of noise on predictive performance. We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into interpretable modes using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and processes them through a neural network for future state forecasting. Unlike existing graph-based traffic forecasters that operate directly on raw or aggregated time series, the proposed hybrid approach, termed the Variational Mode Graph Convolutional Network (VMGCN), first decomposes non-stationary signals into interpretable variational modes by determining the optimal mode count via reconstruction-loss minimization and then learns both intramode and cross-mode spatiotemporal dependencies through a novel attention-augmented GCN. Additionally, we analyze the significance of each mode and the effect of bandwidth constraints on multi-horizon traffic flow predictions. The proposed two-stage design yields significant accuracy gains while providing frequency-level interpretability with demonstrated superior performance on the LargeST dataset for both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The implementation is publicly available on https://github.com/OsamaAhmad369/VMGCN.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST) Submission, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Demand Prediction for Food Delivery Using Attention-Driven Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15246v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate demand forecasting is critical for enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of food delivery platforms, where spatial heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations in order volumes directly influence operational decisions. This paper proposes an attention-based Graph Neural Network framework that captures spatial-temporal dependencies by modeling the food delivery environment as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent urban delivery zones, while edges reflect spatial proximity and inter-regional order flow patterns derived from historical data. The attention mechanism dynamically weighs the influence of neighboring zones, enabling the model to focus on the most contextually relevant areas during prediction. Temporal trends are jointly learned alongside spatial interactions, allowing the model to adapt to evolving demand patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in forecasting future order volumes with high accuracy. The framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution to support proactive fleet positioning, resource allocation, and dispatch optimization in urban food delivery operations.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel multimodal approach, the Long-Short Distance Graph Neural Network (LSDGNN). Based on the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), it constructs a long-distance graph neural network and a short-distance graph neural network to obtain multimodal features of distant and nearby utterances, respectively. To ensure that long- and short-distance features are as distinct as possible in representation while enabling mutual influence between the two modules, we employ a Differential Regularizer and incorporate a BiAffine Module to facilitate feature interaction. In addition, we propose an Improved Curriculum Learning (ICL) to address the challenge of data imbalance. By computing the similarity between different emotions to emphasize the shifts in similar emotions, we design a "weighted emotional shift" metric and develop a difficulty measurer, enabling a training process that prioritizes learning easy samples before harder ones. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Feature Construction Using Network Control Theory and Rank Encoding for Graph Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15195v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we utilize the concept of average controllability in graphs, along with a novel rank encoding method, to enhance the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in social network classification tasks. GNNs have proven highly effective in various network-based learning applications and require some form of node features to function. However, their performance is heavily influenced by the expressiveness of these features. In social networks, node features are often unavailable due to privacy constraints or the absence of inherent attributes, making it challenging for GNNs to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose two strategies for constructing expressive node features. First, we introduce average controllability along with other centrality metrics (denoted as NCT-EFA) as node-level metrics that capture critical aspects of network topology. Building on this, we develop a rank encoding method that transforms average controllability or any other graph-theoretic metric into a fixed-dimensional feature space, thereby improving feature representation. We conduct extensive numerical evaluations using six benchmark GNN models across four social network datasets to compare different node feature construction methods. Our results demonstrate that incorporating average controllability into the feature space significantly improves GNN performance. Moreover, the proposed rank encoding method outperforms traditional one-hot degree encoding, improving the ROC AUC from 68.7% to 73.9% using GraphSAGE on the GitHub Stargazers dataset, underscoring its effectiveness in generating expressive and efficient node representations.</p></details> |  |

An Agent-Based Simulation of Human Mobility in a Futuristic Smart City](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15143v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the feasibility of human mobility in The Line, a proposed 170-kilometer linear smart city in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. To assess whether citizens can move freely within this unprecedented urban topology, we develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and graph neural networks. The simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across 50 vertical levels and varying density scenarios using both synthetic data and real-world traces from high-density cities. Our experiments reveal that with the full AI-integrated architecture, agents achieved an average commute time of 7.8 to 8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89 percent, and a reachability index of over 91 percent, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies confirmed that the removal of intelligent modules such as reinforcement learning or graph neural networks significantly degrades performance, with commute times increasing by up to 85 percent and reachability falling below 70 percent. Environmental modeling further demonstrated low energy consumption and minimal CO2 emissions when electric modes are prioritized. The findings suggest that freedom of movement is not only conceptually achievable in The Line, but also operationally realistic if supported by adaptive AI systems, sustainable infrastructure, and real-time feedback loops.</p></details> |  |

We propose a graph-based deep learning framework to detect epilepsy from low-cost Electroencephalography (EEG) hardware, tested on recordings from Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau. Our focus is on fair, accessible automatic assessment and explainability to shed light on epilepsy biomarkers. Methods: We model EEG signals as spatio-temporal graphs, classify them, and identify interchannel relationships and temporal dynamics using graph attention networks (GAT). To emphasize connectivity biomarkers, we adapt the inherently node-focused GAT to analyze edges. We also designed signal preprocessing for low-fidelity recordings and a lightweight GAT architecture trained on Google Colab and deployed on RaspberryPi devices. Results: The approach achieves promising classification performance, outperforming a standard classifier based on random forest and graph convolutional networks in terms of accuracy and robustness over multiple sessions, but also highlighting specific connections in the fronto-temporal region. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential of GATs to provide insightful and scalable diagnostic support for epilepsy in underserved regions, paving the way for affordable and accessible neurodiagnostic tools.</p></details> |  |

However, their applications have been limited primarily to small-scale datasets because of memory constraints. While distributed training offers a solution, current frameworks lack support for spatiotemporal models and overlook the properties of spatiotemporal data. Informed by a scaling study on a large-scale workload, we present PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I), an extension to PyTorch Geometric Temporal that integrates distributed data parallel training and two novel strategies: index-batching and distributed-index-batching. Our index techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing peak memory usage by up to 89% and achieving up to a 11.78x speedup over standard DDP with 128 GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the 2025 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis</p></details> |

We introduce the Graph Tsetlin Machine (GraphTM) for learning interpretable deep clauses from graph-structured input. Moving beyond flat, fixed-length input, the GraphTM gets more versatile, supporting sequences, grids, relations, and multimodality. Through message passing, the GraphTM builds nested deep clauses to recognize sub-graph patterns with exponentially fewer clauses, increasing both interpretability and data utilization. For image classification, GraphTM preserves interpretability and achieves 3.86%-points higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 than a convolutional TM. For tracking action coreference, faced with increasingly challenging tasks, GraphTM outperforms other reinforcement learning methods by up to 20.6%-points. In recommendation systems, it tolerates increasing noise to a greater extent than a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN), e.g., for noise ratio 0.1, GraphTM obtains accuracy 89.86% compared to GCN's 70.87%. Finally, for viral genome sequence data, GraphTM is competitive with BiLSTM-CNN and GCN accuracy-wise, training 2.5x faster than GCN. The GraphTM's application to these varied fields demonstrates how graph representation learning and deep clauses bring new possibilities for TM learning.</p></details> | 34 pages, 10 figures |

This is a non-Transformer, non-GPT, non-traditional machine learning input-output controlled generative language model. The model is based on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) definition on the directed graph in terms of the neural network, and has the interpretability of all nodes on the graph of the whole model, instead of the traditional machine learning model that only has limited interpretability at the input and output ends. In the language model scenario, the token is defined as a node in the graph. A randomly shaped or user-defined signal flow flows between nodes on the principle of "least resistance" along paths. The next token or node to be predicted or generated is the target of the signal flow. As a language model, BriLLM theoretically supports infinitely long $n$-gram models when the model size is independent of the input and predicted length of the model. The model's working signal flow provides the possibility of recall activation and innate multi-modal support similar to the cognitive patterns of the human brain. At present, we released the first BriLLM version in Chinese, with 4000 tokens, 32-dimensional node width, 16-token long sequence prediction ability, and language model prediction performance comparable to GPT-1. More computing power will help us explore the infinite possibilities depicted above.</p></details> |  |

These difficulties stem from iterative message-passing techniques, which place significant computational demands and require extensive GPU memory, particularly when dealing with the neighbor explosion issue inherent in large-scale graphs. This paper introduces a scalable, low-cost, flexible, and efficient GNN framework called LPS-GNN, which can perform representation learning on 100 billion graphs with a single GPU in 10 hours and shows a 13.8% improvement in User Acquisition scenarios. We examine existing graph partitioning methods and design a superior graph partition algorithm named LPMetis. In particular, LPMetis outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on various evaluation metrics. In addition, our paper proposes a subgraph augmentation strategy to enhance the model's predictive performance. It exhibits excellent compatibility, allowing the entire framework to accommodate various GNN algorithms. Successfully deployed on the Tencent platform, LPS-GNN has been tested on public and real-world datasets, achieving performance lifts of 8. 24% to 13. 89% over SOTA models in online applications.</p></details> |  |

Although GNNs inherently encode specific inductive biases (e.g., acting as low-pass or high-pass filters), most existing methods implicitly assume conditional independence among node labels in their optimization objectives. While this assumption is suitable for traditional classification tasks such as image recognition, it contradicts the intuitive observation that node labels in graphs remain correlated, even after conditioning on the graph structure. To make structured predictions for node labels, we propose ReDiSC, namely, Reparameterized masked Diffusion model for Structured node Classification. ReDiSC estimates the joint distribution of node labels using a reparameterized masked diffusion model, which is learned through the variational expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Our theoretical analysis shows the efficiency advantage of ReDiSC in the E-step compared to DPM-SNC, a state-of-the-art model that relies on a manifold-constrained diffusion model in continuous domain. Meanwhile, we explicitly link ReDiSC's M-step objective to popular GNN and label propagation hybrid approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReDiSC achieves superior or highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GNN, label propagation, and diffusion-based baselines across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs of varying sizes. Notably, ReDiSC scales effectively to large-scale datasets on which previous structured diffusion methods fail due to computational constraints, highlighting its significant practical advantage in structured node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Knowledge Embedding (KE) methods capture global semantics but struggle with dynamic structural integration, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel locally but often lack semantic understanding. Even ensemble approaches, including those leveraging language models, often fail to achieve a deep, adaptive, and synergistic co-evolution between semantic comprehension and structural learning. Addressing this critical gap in fostering continuous, reciprocal refinement between these two aspects in complex biomedical KGs is paramount. Results: We introduce BioGraphFusion, a novel framework for deeply synergistic semantic and structural learning. BioGraphFusion establishes a global semantic foundation via tensor decomposition, guiding an LSTM-driven mechanism to dynamically refine relation embeddings during graph propagation. This fosters adaptive interplay between semantic understanding and structural learning, further enhanced by query-guided subgraph construction and a hybrid scoring mechanism. Experiments across three key biomedical tasks demonstrate BioGraphFusion's superior performance over state-of-the-art KE, GNN, and ensemble models.

However, the traditional methods rely on standard graph structures often fail to capture the intricate higher-order spatio-temporal correlations inherent in real-world traffic dynamics. Standard graphs cannot fully represent the spatial relationships within road networks, which limits the effectiveness of graph-based approaches. In contrast, directed hypergraphs provide more accurate representation of spatial information to model complex directed relationships among multiple nodes. In this paper, we propose DHLight, a novel multi-agent policy-based framework that synergistically integrates directed hypergraph learning module. This framework introduces a novel dynamic directed hypergraph construction mechanism, which captures complex and evolving spatio-temporal relationships among intersections in road networks. By leveraging the directed hypergraph relational structure, DHLight empowers agents to achieve adaptive decision-making in traffic signal control. The effectiveness of DHLight is validated against state-of-the-art baselines through extensive experiments in various network datasets.

A GNN with shallow layer architectures can only learn short-term relation or localized structure information, limiting its power of learning long-term connection, evidenced by their inferior learning performance on heterophilous graphs. Tackling oversmoothing is crucial for harnessing deep-layer architectures for GNNs. To date, many methods have been proposed to alleviate oversmoothing. The vast difference behind their design principles, combined with graph complications, make it difficult to understand and even compare the difference between different approaches in tackling the oversmoothing. In this paper, we propose ATNPA, a unified view with five key steps: Augmentation, Transformation, Normalization, Propagation, and Aggregation, to summarize GNN oversmoothing alleviation approaches. We first propose a taxonomy for GNN oversmoothing alleviation which includes three themes to tackle oversmoothing. After that, we separate all methods into six categories, followed by detailed reviews of representative methods, including their relation to ATNPA, and discussion of their niche, strength, and weakness. The review not only draws an in-depth understanding of existing methods in the field but also shows a clear road map for future study.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages; Published at Knowledge and Information Systems Journal</p></details> |

Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Quantum Search via Recursive Oracle Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15797v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel deterministic quantum search algorithm that provides a practical alternative to conventional probabilistic search approaches. Our scheme eliminates the inherent uncertainty of quantum search without relying on arbitrary phase rotations, a key limitation of other deterministic methods. The algorithm achieves certainty by recursively expanding the base oracle so that it marks all states prefixed by the same two bits as the target, encompassing exactly one-quarter of the search space. This enables a step-by-step reduction of the superposition until the target state can be measured with certainty. The algorithm achieves deterministic success with a query complexity of $O(N^{\log_2(3)/2}) \approx O(N^{0.7925})$, falling between Grover's $O(\sqrt{N})$ scaling and the classical $O(N)$. Our approach relies exclusively on two-qubit nearest-neighbour diffusion operators, avoiding global diffusion entirely. We show that, despite the increased query complexity, this design reduces the total number of two-qubit gates required for diffusion by more than an order of magnitude for search spaces up to at least 18 qubits, with even greater advantages on hardware with limited qubit connectivity. The scheme's inherent determinism, reliance on simple nearest-neighbour, low-depth operations, and scalable recursive structure make it well-suited for hardware implementation. Additionally, we show that the algorithm naturally supports partial database search, enabling deterministic identification of selected target bits without requiring a full search, further broadening its applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures.

Traditional approaches often treat them separately, limiting the ability for interactive planning. While recent diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in multi-agent trajectory generation, their slow sampling is less suitable for high-frequency planning tasks. In this paper, we leverage the consistency model to build a predictive planner that samples from a joint distribution of ego and surrounding agents, conditioned on the ego vehicle's navigational goal. Trained on real-world human driving datasets, our consistency model generates higher-quality trajectories with fewer sampling steps than standard diffusion models, making it more suitable for real-time deployment. To enforce multiple planning constraints simultaneously on the ego trajectory, a novel online guided sampling approach inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is introduced. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our method enables proactive behavior such as nudging and yielding, and also demonstrates smoother, safer, and more efficient trajectories and satisfaction of multiple constraints under a limited computational budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 28th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) 2025</p></details> |

Here, we present DiffuMeta, a generative framework integrating diffusion transformers with a novel algebraic language representation, encoding 3D geometries as mathematical sentences. This compact, unified parameterization spans diverse topologies while enabling direct application of transformers to structural design. DiffuMeta leverages diffusion models to generate novel shell structures with precisely targeted stress-strain responses under large deformations, accounting for buckling and contact while addressing the inherent one-to-many mapping by producing diverse solutions. Uniquely, our approach enables simultaneous control over multiple mechanical objectives, including linear and nonlinear responses beyond training domains. Experimental validation of fabricated structures further confirms the efficacy of our approach for accelerated design of metamaterials and structures with tailored properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[TokensGen: Harnessing Condensed Tokens for Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15728v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while diffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips, extending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and long-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage framework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method decomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic control, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth transition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion model guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses short clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To (Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens at once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference, an adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips, reducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions.

| **[A Practical Investigation of Spatially-Controlled Image Generation with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15724v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models. First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate "forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control consistency. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> | preprint |

Unlike conventional differentiable particle filters, which require importance weighting and typically rely on predefined or low-capacity proposal distributions. DiffPF learns a flexible posterior sampler by conditioning a diffusion model on predicted particles and the current observation. This enables accurate, equally-weighted sampling from complex, high-dimensional, and multimodal filtering distributions. We evaluate DiffPF across a range of scenarios, including both unimodal and highly multimodal distributions, and test it on simulated as well as real-world tasks, where it consistently outperforms existing filtering baselines. In particular, DiffPF achieves an 82.8% improvement in estimation accuracy on a highly multimodal global localization benchmark, and a 26% improvement on the real-world KITTI visual odometry benchmark, compared to state-of-the-art differentiable filters. To the best of our knowledge, DiffPF is the first method to integrate conditional diffusion models into particle filtering, enabling high-quality posterior sampling that produces more informative particles and significantly improves state estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[BackdoorDM: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Backdoor Learning on Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11798v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor learning is a critical research topic for understanding the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks. While the diffusion model (DM) has been broadly deployed in public over the past few years, the understanding of its backdoor vulnerability is still in its infancy compared to the extensive studies in discriminative models. Recently, many different backdoor attack and defense methods have been proposed for DMs, but a comprehensive benchmark for backdoor learning on DMs is still lacking. This absence makes it difficult to conduct fair comparisons and thorough evaluations of the existing approaches, thus hindering future research progress. To address this issue, we propose \textit{BackdoorDM}, the first comprehensive benchmark designed for backdoor learning on DMs. It comprises nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack methods, four SOTA defense strategies, and three useful visualization analysis tools. We first systematically classify and formulate the existing literature in a unified framework, focusing on three different backdoor attack types and five backdoor target types, which are restricted to a single type in discriminative models. Then, we systematically summarize the evaluation metrics for each type and propose a unified backdoor evaluation method based on multimodal large language model (MLLM). Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and highlight several important conclusions. We believe that BackdoorDM will help overcome current barriers and contribute to building a trustworthy artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) community. The codes are released in https://github.com/linweiii/BackdoorDM.</p></details> |  |

Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source text-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12 billion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises concerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability. Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the environment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to enhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models. Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters and prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated images while also lowering the energy consumption required for image generation. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to that of the original SD model. Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion, testing it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our results demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%, ethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and GPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are consistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts. Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social and environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible without fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture.</p></details> |  |

However, modeling their behavior is challenging because of the complex interplay between oxygen availability, drug activation, and cell survival. In this work, we develop a multiscale and mixed-dimensional model that couples spatially resolved drug and oxygen transport with pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to simulate the cellular response. The model integrates blood flow, oxygen diffusion and consumption, drug delivery, and metabolism. To reduce computational cost, we mitigate the global nonlinearity through a one-way coupling of the multiscale and mixed/dimensional models with a reduced 0D model for the drug metabolism. The global sensitivity analysis is then used to identify key parameters influencing drug activation and therapeutic outcome. This approach enables efficient simulation and supports the design of optimized hypoxia-targeted therapies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultra-fast feature learning for the training of two-layer neural networks in the two-timescale regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18208v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the convergence of gradient methods for the training of mean-field single-hidden-layer neural networks with square loss. For this high-dimensional and non-convex optimization problem, most known convergence results are either qualitative or rely on a neural tangent kernel analysis where nonlinear representations of the data are fixed. Using that this problem belongs to the class of separable nonlinear least squares problems, we consider here a Variable Projection (VarPro) or two-timescale learning algorithm, thereby eliminating the linear variables and reducing the learning problem to the training of nonlinear features. In a teacher-student scenario, we show such a strategy enables provable convergence rates for the sampling of a teacher feature distribution. Precisely, in the limit where the regularization strength vanishes, we show that the dynamic of the feature distribution corresponds to a weighted ultra-fast diffusion equation. Recent results on the asymptotic behavior of such PDEs then give quantitative guarantees for the convergence of the learned feature distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[SegDT: A Diffusion Transformer-Based Segmentation Model for Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15595v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is crucial for many healthcare tasks, including disease diagnosis and treatment planning. One key area is the segmentation of skin lesions, which is vital for diagnosing skin cancer and monitoring patients. In this context, this paper introduces SegDT, a new segmentation model based on diffusion transformer (DiT). SegDT is designed to work on low-cost hardware and incorporates Rectified Flow, which improves the generation quality at reduced inference steps and maintains the flexibility of standard diffusion models. Our method is evaluated on three benchmarking datasets and compared against several existing works, achieving state-of-the-art results while maintaining fast inference speeds. This makes the proposed model appealing for real-world medical applications. This work advances the performance and capabilities of deep learning models in medical image analysis, enabling faster, more accurate diagnostic tools for healthcare professionals.

| **[Flow-GRPO: Training Flow Matching Models via Online RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05470v4)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

Linear combinations of such functions are called graph motif parameters and have recently received significant attention in counting complexity after a seminal paper by Curticapean, Dell and Marx (STOC'17). We show that, among linear combinations of functions #IndSub(H,*) involving only graphs H without isolated vertices, precisely those with positive integer coefficients maintain a combinatorial interpretation. It is important to note that graph motif parameters can be nonnegative for all inputs G, even when some coefficients are negative. Formally, we show that evaluating any graph motif parameter with a negative coefficient is impossible in an oracle variant of #P, where an implicit graph is accessed by oracle queries. Our proof follows the classification of the relativizing closure properties of #P by Hertrampf, Vollmer, and Wagner (SCT'95) and the framework developed by Ikenmeyer and Pak (STOC'22), but our application of the required Ramsey theorem turns out to be more subtle, as graphs do not have the required Ramsey property. Our techniques generalize from graphs to relational structures, including colored graphs. Vastly generalizing this, we introduce motif parameters over categories that count occurrences of sub-objects in the category. We then prove a general dichotomy theorem that characterizes which such parameters have a combinatorial interpretation. Using known results in Ramsey theory for categories, we obtain a dichotomy for motif parameters of finite vector spaces as well as parameter sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, full version</p></details> |

This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity connections across frames. We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models to discriminate between coherent image sequences and stories from unrelated images. We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to teach appropriate entity connection behavior. We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic contexts. Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on Qwen2.5-VL 7B). Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1 from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%). Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except "its", and cross-frame character and object persistence increased across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%). Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story, increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[SQLNet: Scale-Modulated Query and Localization Network for Few-Shot Class-Agnostic Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10011v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The class-agnostic counting (CAC) task has recently been proposed to solve the problem of counting all objects of an arbitrary class with several exemplars given in the input image. To address this challenging task, existing leading methods all resort to density map regression, which renders them impractical for downstream tasks that require object locations and restricts their ability to well explore the scale information of exemplars for supervision. To address the limitations, we propose a novel localization-based CAC approach, termed Scale-modulated Query and Localization Network (SQLNet). It fully explores the scales of exemplars in both the query and localization stages and achieves effective counting by accurately locating each object and predicting its approximate size. Specifically, during the query stage, rich discriminative representations of the target class are acquired by the Hierarchical Exemplars Collaborative Enhancement (HECE) module from the few exemplars through multi-scale exemplar cooperation with equifrequent size prompt embedding. These representations are then fed into the Exemplars-Unified Query Correlation (EUQC) module to interact with the query features in a unified manner and produce the correlated query tensor. In the localization stage, the Scale-aware Multi-head Localization (SAML) module utilizes the query tensor to predict the confidence, location, and size of each potential object. Moreover, a scale-aware localization loss is introduced, which exploits flexible location associations and exemplar scales for supervision to optimize the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SQLNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular CAC benchmarks, achieving excellent performance not only in counting accuracy but also in localization and bounding box generation.

| **[Text-promptable Object Counting via Quantity Awareness Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06679v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in solving the text-promptable object counting problem. Representative methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness. Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147, CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability for zero-shot class-agnostic counting.

| **[Counting Stacked Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19149v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual object counting is a fundamental computer vision task underpinning numerous real-world applications, from cell counting in biomedicine to traffic and wildlife monitoring. However, existing methods struggle to handle the challenge of stacked 3D objects in which most objects are hidden by those above them. To address this important yet underexplored problem, we propose a novel 3D counting approach that decomposes the task into two complementary subproblems - estimating the 3D geometry of the object stack and the occupancy ratio from multi-view images. By combining geometric reconstruction and deep learning-based depth analysis, our method can accurately count identical objects within containers, even when they are irregularly stacked. We validate our 3D Counting pipeline on diverse real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets, which we will release publicly to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV2...</summary><p>ICCV25.

| **[Prompt-Free Conditional Diffusion for Multi-object Image Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06146v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models has underpinned much recent advances of dataset augmentation in various computer vision tasks. However, when involving generating multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images, resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization capabilities.

In this work, we present the first large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions: (1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3) How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context? Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key areas for improvement in medical visual language models.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we evaluate the extent to which vision-and-language models (VLMs) are compatible with humans when producing or judging the appropriateness of vague quantifiers in visual contexts. We release a novel dataset, VAQUUM, containing 20,300 human ratings on quantified statements across a total of 1089 images. Using this dataset, we compare human judgments and VLM predictions using three different evaluation methods. Our findings show that VLMs, like humans, are influenced by object counts in vague quantifier use. However, we find significant inconsistencies across models in different evaluation settings, suggesting that judging and producing vague quantifiers rely on two different processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ACL 2025, 10 pages</p></details> |

Despite progress in computer vision, existing benchmarks reveal significant gaps in models' abilities to accurately recognize object attributes and reason about spatial relationships, both essential for dynamic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose MIRAGE, a multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate models' capabilities in Counting (object attribute recognition), Relation (spatial relational reasoning), and Counting with Relation. Through diverse and complex scenarios requiring fine-grained recognition and reasoning, MIRAGE highlights critical limitations in state-of-the-art models, underscoring the need for improved representations and reasoning frameworks. By targeting these foundational abilities, MIRAGE provides a pathway toward spatiotemporal reasoning in future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Theory of Conditional Feature Alignment for Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17137v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object counting models suffer when deployed across domains with differing density variety, since density shifts are inherently task-relevant and violate standard domain adaptation assumptions. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets (e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in unsupervised domain-adaptive counting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with varying density distributions. The results show that our method outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Unlike prior approaches that mostly rely on deterministic part pose prediction and category-specific training, Assembler is designed to handle diverse, in-the-wild objects with varying part counts, geometries, and structures. It addresses the core challenges of scaling to general 3D part assembly through innovations in task formulation, representation, and data. First, Assembler casts part assembly as a generative problem and employs diffusion models to sample plausible configurations, effectively capturing ambiguities arising from symmetry, repeated parts, and multiple valid assemblies. Second, we introduce a novel shape-centric representation based on sparse anchor point clouds, enabling scalable generation in Euclidean space rather than SE(3) pose prediction. Third, we construct a large-scale dataset of over 320K diverse part-object assemblies using a synthesis and filtering pipeline built on existing 3D shape repositories. Assembler achieves state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and is the first to demonstrate high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects. Based on Assembler, we further introduce an interesting part-aware 3D modeling system that generates high-resolution, editable objects from images, demonstrating potential for interactive and compositional design.

This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and significantly outperforms strong baselines.

| **[ViCrit: A Verifiable Reinforcement Learning Proxy Task for Visual Perception in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10128v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle, synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math, showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Same Task, Different Circuits: Disentangling Modality-Specific Mechanisms in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09047v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the \textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach for reducing it.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARMOT: Masked Autoencoder for Modeling Transient Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08470v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained models have demonstrated impressive success in many modalities such as language and vision. Recent works facilitate the pretraining paradigm in imaging research. Transients are a novel modality, which are captured for an object as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved sensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of hidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using NLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or surfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned from datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling transient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a self-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient datasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features from partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the unmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts full measurements. Pretrained on TransVerse-a synthesized transient dataset of 500K 3D models-MARMOT adapts to downstream imaging tasks using direct feature transfer or decoder finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the efficiency of our MARMOT.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing works focus on designing architectures and constructing visual cues only for the specific task, which ignores the potential uniformity introduced by the DL paradigm. In this paper, we attempt to construct a novel $\underline{ComP}$lementary $\underline{tr}$ansformer, $\textbf{ComPtr}$, for diverse bi-source dense prediction tasks. Specifically, unlike existing methods that over-specialize in a single task or a subset of tasks, ComPtr starts from the more general concept of bi-source dense prediction. Based on the basic dependence on information complementarity, we propose consistency enhancement and difference awareness components with which ComPtr can evacuate and collect important visual semantic cues from different image sources for diverse tasks, respectively. ComPtr treats different inputs equally and builds an efficient dense interaction model in the form of sequence-to-sequence on top of the transformer. This task-generic design provides a smooth foundation for constructing the unified model that can simultaneously deal with various bi-source information. In extensive experiments across several representative vision tasks, i.e. remote sensing change detection, RGB-T crowd counting, RGB-D/T salient object detection, and RGB-D semantic segmentation, the proposed method consistently obtains favorable performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/lartpang/ComPtr.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods sometimes lead to the generation of hallucinated captions, compromising caption quality. This paper explores the issue of hallucination in 3D object captioning, with a focus on Cap3D method, which renders 3D objects into 2D views for captioning using pre-trained models. We pinpoint a major challenge: certain rendered views of 3D objects are atypical, deviating from the training data of standard image captioning models and causing hallucinations. To tackle this, we present DiffuRank, a method that leverages a pre-trained text-to-3D model to assess the alignment between 3D objects and their 2D rendered views, where the view with high alignment closely represent the object's characteristics. By ranking all rendered views and feeding the top-ranked ones into GPT4-Vision, we enhance the accuracy and detail of captions, enabling the correction of 200k captions in the Cap3D dataset and extending it to 1 million captions across Objaverse and Objaverse-XL datasets. Additionally, we showcase the adaptability of DiffuRank by applying it to pre-trained text-to-image models for a Visual Question Answering task, where it outperforms the CLIP model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV2...</summary><p>ECCV2024, Dataset link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiange/Cap3D</p></details> |

However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and requires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this analysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities for interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in providing detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for integrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted analysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study, several LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the quality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different NDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions. Each LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed descriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and demonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine models provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of topics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models are summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of the bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more effective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an innovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and summarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and enhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Pre-training of Multimodal Language Models Customized for Chart Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14506v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies customizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for domain-specific tasks have yielded promising results, especially in the field of scientific chart comprehension. These studies generally utilize visual instruction tuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer (QA) accuracy within the chart domain. However, they often neglect the fundamental discrepancy between natural image-caption pre-training data and digital chart image-QA data, particularly in the models' capacity to extract underlying numeric values from charts. This paper tackles this oversight by exploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs' comprehension of charts. We present three key findings: (1) Incorporating raw data values in alignment pre-training markedly improves comprehension of chart data. (2) Replacing images with their textual representation randomly during end-to-end fine-tuning transfer the language reasoning capability to chart interpretation skills. (3) Requiring the model to first extract the underlying chart data and then answer the question in the fine-tuning can further improve the accuracy. Consequently, we introduce CHOPINLLM, an MLLM tailored for in-depth chart comprehension. CHOPINLLM effectively interprets various types of charts, including unannotated ones, while maintaining robust reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of different chart types across various comprehension levels. Experimental results show that CHOPINLLM exhibits strong performance in understanding both annotated and unannotated charts across a wide range of types.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Adaptive Foundation Models</p></details> |

However, they overlook the semantic enhancement effects of large multimodal models and pay little attention to the emotional features of news. In addition, people find that fake news is more inclined to contain negative emotions than real ones. Therefore, we propose a novel Semantic Enhancement and Emotional Reasoning (SEER) Network for multimodal fake news detection. We generate summarized captions for image semantic understanding and utilize the products of large multimodal models for semantic enhancement. Inspired by the perceived relationship between news authenticity and emotional tendencies, we propose an expert emotional reasoning module that simulates real-life scenarios to optimize emotional features and infer the authenticity of news. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our SEER over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | Accepted by SMC 2025 |

However, previous research has not adequately understood the semantics of images, and models struggle to discern news authenticity with limited textual information. Meanwhile, treating all emotional types of news uniformly without tailored approaches further leads to performance degradation. Therefore, we propose a novel Knowledge Augmentation and Emotion Guidance Network (KEN). On the one hand, we effectively leverage LVLM's powerful semantic understanding and extensive world knowledge. For images, the generated captions provide a comprehensive understanding of image content and scenes, while for text, the retrieved evidence helps break the information silos caused by the closed and limited text and context. On the other hand, we consider inter-class differences between different emotional types of news through balanced learning, achieving fine-grained modeling of the relationship between emotional types and authenticity. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our KEN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods struggle with cross-modal heterogeneity, where visual and textual features reside in disparate semantic spaces, creating substantial inter-modal gaps that limit fusion effectiveness. We propose SCMM (Sew Calibration and Masked Modeling), a novel framework addressing these fusion challenges through two complementary mechanisms. First, our sew calibration loss implements adaptive margin constraints guided by caption quality, dynamically aligning image-text features while accommodating varying information density across modalities. Second, our masked caption modeling loss establishes fine-grained cross-modal correspondences through masked prediction tasks and cross-modal attention, enabling detailed visual-textual relationship learning. The streamlined dual-encoder architecture maintains computational efficiency while achieving superior fusion performance through synergistic alignment and correspondence strategies. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate SCMM's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art Rank1 accuracies of 73.81%, 64.25%, and 57.35% on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReID respectively. These results demonstrate the importance of quality-aware adaptive constraints and fine-grained correspondence modeling in advancing multimodal information fusion for person search applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In the context of remote sensing, image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex satellite imagery, aiding applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and urban planning. This motivates us, in this paper, to present a transformer based network architecture for remote sensing image captioning (RSIC) in which multiple techniques of Static Expansion, Memory-Augmented Self-Attention, Mesh Transformer are evaluated and integrated. We evaluate our proposed models using two benchmark remote sensing image datasets of UCM-Caption and NWPU-Caption. Our best model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on most of evaluation metrics, which demonstrates potential to apply for real-life remote sensing image systems.</p></details> |  |

Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text, without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2025 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics</p></details> |
| **[RetinaLogos: Fine-Grained Synthesis of High-Resolution Retinal Images Through Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12887v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of high-quality, labelled retinal imaging data, which presents a significant challenge in the development of machine learning models for ophthalmology, hinders progress in the field. Existing methods for synthesising Colour Fundus Photographs (CFPs) largely rely on predefined disease labels, which restricts their ability to generate images that reflect fine-grained anatomical variations, subtle disease stages, and diverse pathological features beyond coarse class categories. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce an innovative pipeline that creates a large-scale, captioned retinal dataset comprising 1.4 million entries, called RetinaLogos-1400k. Specifically, RetinaLogos-1400k uses the visual language model(VLM) to describe retinal conditions and key structures, such as optic disc configuration, vascular distribution, nerve fibre layers, and pathological features. Building on this dataset, we employ a novel three-step training framework, RetinaLogos, which enables fine-grained semantic control over retinal images and accurately captures different stages of disease progression, subtle anatomical variations, and specific lesion types. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance across multiple datasets, with 62.07% of text-driven synthetic CFPs indistinguishable from real ones by ophthalmologists. Moreover, the synthetic data improves accuracy by 5%-10% in diabetic retinopathy grading and glaucoma detection.

This makes it difficult to distinguish between similar-looking concepts with potentially different cultural meanings. Such deficiencies are mainly due to a limited amount of high-quality cultural data, contextual information, and the lack of negative examples that highlight subtle differences. To mitigate this, we design a data curation pipeline leveraging open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image models to construct CulTwin, a synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but are culturally different. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to develop CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced captions and synthetic images through tailored contrastive learning. Experiments on culture-specific benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained concept recognition on certain tasks while preserving CLIP's original generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.</p></details> | 25 pages, COLM 2025 |

LG-CAV-MAE integrates a pretrained text encoder into contrastive audio-visual masked autoencoders, enabling the model to learn across audio, visual and text modalities. To train LG-CAV-MAE, we introduce an automatic method to generate audio-visual-text triplets from unlabeled videos. We first generate frame-level captions using an image captioning model and then apply CLAP-based filtering to ensure strong alignment between audio and captions. This approach yields high-quality audio-visual-text triplets without requiring manual annotations. We evaluate LG-CAV-MAE on audio-visual retrieval tasks, as well as an audio-visual classification task. Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to a 5.6% improvement in recall@10 for retrieval tasks and a 3.2% improvement for the classification task.</p></details> | Interspeech 2025 |

Multiple heads intuitively enable different parallel processes over the same input. Yet, they also obscure the attribution of each input patch to the output of a model. We propose a novel 1-head Transformer Attention Bottleneck (TAB) layer, inserted after the traditional MHSA architecture, to serve as an attention bottleneck for interpretability and intervention. Unlike standard self-attention, TAB constrains the total attention over all patches to $\in [0, 1]$. That is, when the total attention is 0, no visual information is propagated further into the network, and the vision-language model (VLM) would default to a generic, image-independent response. To demonstrate the advantages of TAB, we train VLMs with TAB to perform image-difference captioning. Over three datasets, our models perform similarly to baseline VLMs in captioning but the bottleneck is superior in localizing changes and in identifying when no changes occur. TAB is the first architecture to enable users to debug by editing attention, which often produces expected outputs by VLMs.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the CV-Probes dataset, containing image-caption pairs involving verb phrases that require both social knowledge and visual context to interpret (e.g., "beg"), as well as pairs involving verb phrases that can be grounded based on information directly available in the image (e.g., "sit"). We show that VL models struggle to ground VPs that are strongly context-dependent. Further analysis using explainable AI techniques shows that such models may not pay sufficient attention to the verb token in the captions. Our results suggest a need for improved methodologies in VL model training and evaluation.

We introduce ViLU, a new Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations. ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found here: https://github.com/ykrmm/ViLU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent Natural Language with Communication Games for Improving Image Captioning Capabilities without Additional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08610v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems, and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models. Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the 'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the 'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the $44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the 'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii) a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.</p></details> |  |

Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569 for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for microscopy based patient diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment. We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be applied to broader research areas.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

However, challenges remain in integrating speech, text, and vision into a unified model, especially for spoken tasks. Speech generation methods vary (some produce speech directly), others through text (but their impact on quality is unclear). Evaluation often relies on automatic speech recognition, which may introduce bias. We propose SVLA, a unified speech vision language model based on a transformer architecture that handles multimodal inputs and outputs. We train it on 38.2 million speech text image examples, including 64.1 hours of synthetic speech. We also introduce Speech VQA Accuracy, a new metric for evaluating spoken responses. SVLA improves multimodal understanding and generation by better combining speech, vision, and language.</p></details> | 21 pages |

This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced, cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings, we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis reveals that existing hallucination detection methods struggle with detailed captions. We attribute this to the increasing reliance of MLLMs on their generated text, rather than the input image, as the sequence length grows. To address this issue, we propose a multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and a benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight a limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLM's performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions.

From event ticketing, vendor booth or lodging reservations, sanitation, event scheduling, customer service, crime reporting, media streaming and messaging on digital display boards, surveillance, crowd control, traffic control and many other services are based on mobile and web applications, wired and wireless networking, network of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras, specialized control room with network and video-feed monitoring. Consequently, cyber threats directed at such digital infrastructure are common. Starting from hobby hackers, hacktivists, cyber crime gangs, to the nation state actors, all target such infrastructure to unleash chaos on an otherwise smooth operation, and often the cyber threat actors attempt to embarrass the organizing country or the organizers. Unlike long-standing organizations such as a corporate or a government department, the infrastructure of mega-events is temporary, constructed over a short time span in expediency, and often shortcuts are taken to make the deadline for the event. As a result, securing such an elaborate yet temporary infrastructure requires a different approach than securing a standard organizational digital infrastructure. In this paper, we describe our approach to securing MahaKumbh 2025, a 600 million footfall event for 45 days in Prayagraj, India, as a cyber security assessment and risk management oversight team. We chronicle the scope, process, methodology, and outcome of our team's effort to secure this mega event. It should be noted that none of the cyber attacks during the 45-day event was successful. Our goal is to put on record the methodology and discuss what we would do differently in case we work on similar future mega event.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 tables |

The FMTE is a composite of machine learning models trained on experimental binding energies from the Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME) 2012. The FMTE predicts binding energy values for all nuclei with N > 7 and Z > 7 from AME 2020 with a standard deviation of 76 keV and a mean average deviation of 34 keV. The FMTE model was developed by combining three new models with one prior model. The new models presented here have been trained on binding energy residuals from mass models using four machine learning approaches. The models presented in this work leverage shape parameters along with other physical features. We have determined the preferred machine learning approach for binding energy residuals is the least-squares boosted ensemble of trees. This approach appears to have a superior ability to both interpolate and extrapolate binding energy residuals. A comparison with the masses of isotopes that were not measured previously and a discussion of extrapolations approaching the neutron drip line have been included.</p></details> | <details><summary>Phys....</summary><p>Phys.

We also show how to reduce the running time for the second shortest homotopically non-trivial closed walk to $O(n\log n)$ when both the genus and the number of boundaries are fixed. Our algorithms rely on a careful analysis of the configurations of the first three shortest homotopically non-trivial curves in $S$. As an intermediate step, we also describe how to compute a shortest essential arc between \emph{one} pair of vertices or between \emph{all} pairs of vertices of a given boundary component of $S$ in $O(n^2)$ time or $O(n^3)$ time, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 6 figures.

A common approach applied by the current SOTAs in OCL is with the use of memory saving exemplars or features from previous classes to be replayed in the current task. On the other hand, the prompt-based approach performs excellently in continual learning but with the cost of a growing number of trainable parameters. The first approach may not be applicable in practice due to data openness policy, while the second approach has the issue of throughput associated with the streaming data. In this study, we propose a novel prompt-based method for online continual learning that includes 4 main components: (1) single light-weight prompt generator as a general knowledge, (2) trainable scaler-and-shifter as specific knowledge, (3) pre-trained model (PTM) generalization preserving, and (4) hard-soft updates mechanism. Our proposed method achieves significantly higher performance than the current SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB dataset. Our complexity analysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of parameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput. For further study, the source code of our method is available at https://github.com/anwarmaxsum/PROL.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage, supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a 2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse lighting and weather conditions.

| **[EXPO: Stable Reinforcement Learning with Expressive Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07986v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution. The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.</p></details> | <details><summary>corre...</summary><p>corrected typo, formatting, added experiments</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Variation-Resilient Random Number Generator for Embedded Encryption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05523v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With a growing interest in securing user data within the internet-of-things (IoT), embedded encryption has become of paramount importance, requiring light-weight high-quality Random Number Generators (RNGs). Emerging stochastic device technologies produce random numbers from stochastic physical processes at high quality, however, their generated random number streams are adversely affected by process and supply voltage variations, which can lead to bias in the generated streams. In this work, we present an adaptive variation-resilient RNG capable of extracting unbiased encryption-grade random number streams from physically driven entropy sources, for embedded cryptography applications. As a proof of concept, we employ a stochastic magnetic tunnel junction (sMTJ) device as an entropy source. The impact of variations in the sMTJ is mitigated by employing an adaptive digitizer with an adaptive voltage reference that dynamically tracks any stochastic signal drift or deviation, leading to unbiased random bit stream generation. The generated unbiased bit streams, due to their higher entropy, then only need to undergo simplified post-processing. Statistical randomness tests based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test suite are conducted on bit streams obtained using simulations and FPGA entropy source emulation experiments, validating encryption-grade randomness at a significantly reduced hardware cost, and across a wide range of process-induced device variations and supply voltage fluctuations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random weights of DNNs and emergence of fixed points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04182v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is concerned with a special class of deep neural networks (DNNs) where the input and the output vectors have the same dimension. Such DNNs are widely used in applications, e.g., autoencoders. The training of such networks can be characterized by their fixed points (FPs). We are concerned with the dependence of the FPs number and their stability on the distribution of randomly initialized DNNs' weight matrices. Specifically, we consider the i.i.d. random weights with heavy and light-tail distributions. Our objectives are twofold. First, the dependence of FPs number and stability of FPs on the type of the distribution tail. Second, the dependence of the number of FPs on the DNNs' architecture. We perform extensive simulations and show that for light tails (e.g., Gaussian), which are typically used for initialization, a single stable FP exists for broad types of architectures. In contrast, for heavy tail distributions (e.g., Cauchy), which typically appear in trained DNNs, a number of FPs emerge. We further observe that these FPs are stable attractors and their basins of attraction partition the domain of input vectors. Finally, we observe an intriguing non-monotone dependence of the number of fixed points $Q(L)$ on the DNNs' depth $L$. The above results were first obtained for untrained DNNs with two types of distributions at initialization and then verified by considering DNNs in which the heavy tail distributions arise in training.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Lightweight Method for Generating Multi-Tier JIT Compilation Virtual Machine in a Meta-Tracing Compiler Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17460v3)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta-compiler frameworks, such as RPython and Graal/Truffle, generate high-performance virtual machines (VMs) from interpreter definitions. Although they generate VMs with high-quality just-in-time (JIT) compilers, they still lack an important feature that dedicated VMs (i.e., VMs that are developed for specific languages) have, namely \emph{multi-tier compilation}. Multi-tier compilation uses light-weight compilers at early stages and highly-optimizing compilers at later stages in order to balance between compilation overheads and code quality. We propose a novel approach to enabling multi-tier compilation in the VMs generated by a meta-compiler framework. Instead of extending the JIT compiler backend of the framework, our approach drives an existing (heavyweight) compiler backend in the framework to quickly generate unoptimized native code by merely embedding directives and compile-time operations into interpreter definitions. As a validation of the approach, we developed 2SOM, a Simple Object Machine with a two-tier JIT compiler based on RPython. 2SOM first applies the tier-1 threaded code generator that is generated by our proposed technique, then, to the loops that exceed a threshold, applies the tier-2 tracing JIT compiler that is generated by the original RPython framework. Our performance evaluation that runs a program with a realistic workload showed that 2SOM improved, when compared against an RPython-based VM, warm-up performance by 15\%, with merely a 5\% reduction in peak performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECOOP...</summary><p>ECOOP 2025.

This class of functions has enabled the development of non-linear statistical concepts, such as distance variance, distance covariance, and distance correlation. The main obstacle is the computational burden associated with $\mathcal{\varepsilon}$-statistics is substantial, particularly when the data are multivariate. To address this challenge, we have developed a method to significantly reduce memory requirements and accelerate computations, thus facilitating the analysis of large data sets. The following cases are demonstrated: univariate and multivariate distance variance, distance covariance, partial distance correlation, energy distance, and hypothesis testing for the equality of univariate distributions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing lidar and camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in visually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data processing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer a cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging regardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers from sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this work, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph neural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in complex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the low-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such resource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources. We evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and autonomous navigation, in three different environments. Our results demonstrate strong reliability and generalizability, making RaGNNarok a robust solution for low-cost indoor mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

Current approaches extract the surface through costly post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds, with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior, our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics simulations or animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

Most existing machine learning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each microstructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained foundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic microstructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a microstructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained state-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM) in two case studies on machine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on simulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys based on experimental data published in literature. Our results show the potential of foundational vision transformers for robust microstructure representation and efficient machine learning of microstructure--property relationships without the need for expensive task-specific training or fine-tuning of bespoke deep learning models.</p></details> |  |

We propose a light-weight, target-speaker-based extension to an existing streaming ASR system to enable practical transcription of overlapping speech with minimal computational overhead. Our approach combines a speaker-independent (SI) model for standard operation with a speaker-conditioned (SC) model selectively applied in overlapping scenarios. Overlap detection is achieved using a compact binary classifier trained on frozen SI model output, offering accurate segmentation at negligible cost. The SC model employs Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to incorporate speaker embeddings and is trained on synthetically mixed data to transcribe only the target speaker. Our method supports dynamic speaker tracking and reuses existing modules with minimal modifications. Evaluated on a challenging set of Czech television debates with 16% overlap, the system reduced WER on overlapping segments from 68.0% (baseline) to 35.78% while increasing total computational load by only 44%. The proposed system offers an effective and scalable solution for overlap transcription in continuous ASR services.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learning Point Correspondences In Radar 3D Point Clouds For Radar-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18580v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using 3D point clouds in odometry estimation in robotics often requires finding a set of correspondences between points in subsequent scans. While there are established methods for point clouds of sufficient quality, state-of-the-art still struggles when this quality drops. Thus, this paper presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting robust point correspondences between pairs of noisy, sparse and unstructured 3D point clouds from a light-weight, low-power, inexpensive, consumer-grade System-on-Chip (SoC) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensor. Our network is based on the transformer architecture which allows leveraging the attention mechanism to discover pairs of points in consecutive scans with the greatest mutual affinity. The proposed network is trained in a self-supervised way using set-based multi-label classification cross-entropy loss, where the ground-truth set of matches is found by solving the Linear Sum Assignment (LSA) optimization problem, which avoids tedious hand annotation of the training data. Additionally, posing the loss calculation as multi-label classification permits supervising on point correspondences directly instead of on odometry error, which is not feasible for sparse and noisy data from the SoC radar we use. We evaluate our method with an open-source state-of-the-art Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) framework in real-world Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights and with the widely used public Coloradar dataset. Evaluation shows that the proposed method improves the position estimation accuracy by over 14 % and 19 % on average, respectively.

| **[Global Microprocessor Correctness in the Presence of Transient Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17154v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Correctness for microprocessors is generally understood to be conformance with the associated instruction set architecture (ISA). This is the basis for one of the most important abstractions in computer science, allowing hardware designers to develop highly-optimized processors that are functionally "equivalent" to an ideal processor that executes instructions atomically. This specification is almost always informal, e.g., commercial microprocessors generally do not come with conformance specifications. In this paper, we advocate for the use of formal specifications, using the theory of refinement. We introduce notions of correctness that can be used to deal with transient execution attacks, including Meltdown and Spectre. Such attacks have shown that ubiquitous microprocessor optimizations, appearing in numerous processors for decades, are inherently buggy. Unlike alternative approaches that use non-interference properties, our notion of correctness is global, meaning it is single specification that: formalizes conformance, includes functional correctness and is parameterized by an microarchitecture. We introduce action skipping refinement, a new type of refinement and we describe how our notions of refinement can be decomposed into properties that are more amenable to automated verification using the the concept of shared-resource commitment refinement maps. We do this in the context of formal, fully executable bit- and cycle-accurate models of an ISA and a microprocessor. Finally, we show how light-weight formal methods based on property-based testing can be used to identify transient execution bugs.</p></details> |  |

However, training the candidates generated by the search algorithm for performance evaluation incurs considerable computational overhead.

Our training-free NAS method is data-agnostic and light-weight. It can find the best architecture among 200 randomly sampled architectures from NAS-Bench201 in 217 CPU seconds. Besides, our method is able to achieve competitive performance on various datasets including NASBench-101, NASBench-201, and NDS search spaces.

Such models are light-weight and computationally efficient, allowing them to be trained on consumer laptops. SHRED-based models rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the temporal encoding and spatial decoding respectively. Despite the relatively simple structure of SHRED, they are able to predict chaotic dynamical systems on different physical, spatial, and temporal scales directly from a sparse set of sensor measurements. In this work, we improve SHRED by leveraging transformers (T-SHRED) for the temporal encoding which improves performance on next-step state prediction on large datasets. We also introduce a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) attention mechanism into T-SHRED to perform symbolic regression directly on the latent space as part of the model regularization architecture. Symbolic regression improves model interpretability by learning and regularizing the dynamics of the latent space during training. We analyze the performance of T-SHRED on three different dynamical systems ranging from low-data to high-data regimes. We observe that SINDy attention T-SHRED accurately predicts future frames based on an interpretable symbolic model across all tested datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Transactions of the Royal Society (Symbolic Regression in the Physical Sciences)</p></details> |

However, we show that the current SRG analysis suffers from a pitfall that limits its applicability in analyzing practical nonlinear systems. We overcome this pitfall by introducing a novel reformulation of the SRG of a linear time-invariant operator and combining the SRG with the Nyquist criterion. The result is a theorem that can be used to assess stability and $L_2$-gain performance for general interconnections of nonlinear dynamic systems. We provide practical calculation results for canonical interconnections and apply our result to Lur'e systems to obtain a generalization of the celebrated circle criterion, which deals with broader class of nonlinearities, and we derive (incremental) $L_2$-gain performance bounds. We illustrate the power of the new approach on the analysis of several examples.</p></details> |  |

Recent top-performing approaches are prompt-based methods that utilize a set of learnable parameters (i.e., prompts) to encode task knowledge, from which appropriate ones are selected to guide the fixed pre-trained model in generating features tailored to a certain task. However, existing methods rely on predicting prompt identities for prompt selection, where the identity prediction process cannot be optimized with task loss. This limitation leads to sub-optimal prompt selection and inadequate adaptation of pre-trained features for a specific task. Previous efforts have tried to address this by directly generating prompts from input queries instead of selecting from a set of candidates. However, these prompts are continuous, which lack sufficient abstraction for task knowledge representation, making them less effective for continual learning. To address these challenges, we propose VQ-Prompt, a prompt-based continual learning method that incorporates Vector Quantization (VQ) into end-to-end training of a set of discrete prompts. In this way, VQ-Prompt can optimize the prompt selection process with task loss and meanwhile achieve effective abstraction of task knowledge for continual learning. Extensive experiments show that VQ-Prompt outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods across a variety of benchmarks under the challenging class-incremental setting.

Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding, we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental learning.

| **[Noradrenergic-inspired gain modulation attenuates the stability gap in joint training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14056v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning, revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably, persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps. Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap. Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 1 pseudo-code</p></details> |

The emergence of foundation models (FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization, replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real world medical applications.

Beyond Unexplored Doubts in Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13739v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions. Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>6th C...</summary><p>6th CLVISION ICCV Workshop accepted</p></details> |

The absence of ground truths for unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB) is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions. To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to WACV 2025 (Tucson, Arizona, USA), February 28-March 4 2025</p></details> |

With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models. Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring additional replay data.

| **[The Bayesian Approach to Continual Learning: An Overview](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08922v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is an online paradigm where a learner continually accumulates knowledge from different tasks encountered over sequential time steps. Importantly, the learner is required to extend and update its knowledge without forgetting about the learning experience acquired from the past, and while avoiding the need to retrain from scratch. Given its sequential nature and its resemblance to the way humans think, continual learning offers an opportunity to address several challenges which currently stand in the way of widening the range of applicability of deep models to further real-world problems. The continual need to update the learner with data arriving sequentially strikes inherent congruence between continual learning and Bayesian inference which provides a principal platform to keep updating the prior beliefs of a model given new data, without completely forgetting the knowledge acquired from the old data. This survey inspects different settings of Bayesian continual learning, namely task-incremental learning and class-incremental learning. We begin by discussing definitions of continual learning along with its Bayesian setting, as well as the links with related fields, such as domain adaptation, transfer learning and meta-learning. Afterwards, we introduce a taxonomy offering a comprehensive categorization of algorithms belonging to the Bayesian continual learning paradigm. Meanwhile, we analyze the state-of-the-art while zooming in on some of the most prominent Bayesian continual learning algorithms to date. Furthermore, we shed some light on links between continual learning and developmental psychology, and correspondingly introduce analogies between both fields. We follow that with a discussion of current challenges, and finally conclude with potential areas for future research on Bayesian continual learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[BayesTTA: Continual-Temporal Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models via Gaussian Discriminant Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08607v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting; entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data, adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment. We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets. Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining efficiency.

| **[Embedding Space Allocation with Angle-Norm Joint Classifiers for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09250v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continually learn new classes from only a few samples without forgetting previous ones, requiring intelligent agents to adapt to dynamic environments. FSCIL combines the characteristics and challenges of class-incremental learning and few-shot learning: (i) Current classes occupy the entire feature space, which is detrimental to learning new classes. (ii) The small number of samples in incremental rounds is insufficient for fully training. In existing mainstream virtual class methods, for addressing the challenge (i), they attempt to use virtual classes as placeholders. However, new classes may not necessarily align with the virtual classes. For the challenge (ii), they replace trainable fully connected layers with Nearest Class Mean (NCM) classifiers based on cosine similarity, but NCM classifiers do not account for sample imbalance issues. To address these issues in previous methods, we propose the class-center guided embedding Space Allocation with Angle-Norm joint classifiers (SAAN) learning framework, which provides balanced space for all classes and leverages norm differences caused by sample imbalance to enhance classification criteria. Specifically, for challenge (i), SAAN divides the feature space into multiple subspaces and allocates a dedicated subspace for each session by guiding samples with the pre-set category centers. For challenge (ii), SAAN establishes a norm distribution for each class and generates angle-norm joint logits. Experiments demonstrate that SAAN can achieve state-of-the-art performance and it can be directly embedded into other SOTA methods as a plug-in, further enhancing their performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to Neural Networks</p></details> |
| **[Mamba-CL: Optimizing Selective State Space Model in Null Space for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15469v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Learning (CL) aims to equip AI models with the ability to learn a sequence of tasks over time, without forgetting previously learned knowledge. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba model, have achieved notable success in computer vision. Building on the strengths of SSMs, this study explores leveraging the Mamba model for CL. Therefore, we introduce Mamba-CL, a framework that continuously fine-tunes the core SSMs of the large-scale Mamba foundation model by updating parameters orthogonal to the feature subspace of previous tasks. This approach theoretically guarantees the consistency objective aiming to preserves consistent output for each SSM module across both previous and current tasks, so as to overcome catastrophic forgetting issue. Specifically, we achieve this goal by deducing the overall consistency constraints on four key time-invariant parameters in the Mamba model, streamlining its recurrent state-space structure and non-linear discretization process in SSM. In practice, we apply the null-space projection to efficiently implement the orthogonality within Mamba model. Extensive experiments on four class-incremental benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of Mamba-CL for anti-forgetting, achieving superior performances to state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Rethinking Query-based Transformer for Continual Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07831v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study, however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks, settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Balancing the Past and Present: A Coordinated Replay Framework for Federated Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07712v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[OVOR: OnePrompt with Virtual Outlier Regularization for Rehearsal-Free Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04129v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have shown that by using large pre-trained models along with learnable prompts, rehearsal-free methods for class-incremental learning (CIL) settings can achieve superior performance to prominent rehearsal-based ones. Rehearsal-free CIL methods struggle with distinguishing classes from different tasks, as those are not trained together. In this work we propose a regularization method based on virtual outliers to tighten decision boundaries of the classifier, such that confusion of classes among different tasks is mitigated. Recent prompt-based methods often require a pool of task-specific prompts, in order to prevent overwriting knowledge of previous tasks with that of the new task, leading to extra computation in querying and composing an appropriate prompt from the pool. This additional cost can be eliminated, without sacrificing accuracy, as we reveal in the paper. We illustrate that a simplified prompt-based method can achieve results comparable to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods equipped with a prompt pool, using much less learnable parameters and lower inference cost. Our regularization method has demonstrated its compatibility with different prompt-based methods, boosting those previous SOTA rehearsal-free CIL methods' accuracy on the ImageNet-R and CIFAR-100 benchmarks.

Although effective in homogeneous task sequences, these approaches struggle when faced with the heterogeneity of real-world task distributions. We introduce Plasticity-Enhanced Test-Time Adaptation in Class-Incremental Learning (PLASTIC), a method that reinstates plasticity in CIL while preserving model stability. PLASTIC leverages Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) by dynamically fine-tuning LayerNorm parameters on unlabeled test data, enabling adaptability to evolving tasks and improving robustness against data corruption. To prevent TTA-induced model divergence and maintain stable learning across tasks, we introduce a teacher-student distillation framework, ensuring that adaptation remains controlled and generalizable. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PLASTIC consistently outperforms both conventional and state-of-the-art PTM-based CIL approaches, while also exhibiting inherent robustness to data corruptions.

Despite existing pre-trained model (PTM) based methods performing excellently in CIL, it is better to fine-tune them on downstream incremental tasks with massive patterns unknown to PTMs. However, using task streams for fine-tuning could lead to \textit{catastrophic forgetting} that will erase the knowledge in PTMs. This paper proposes the Dual Prototype network for Task-wise Adaption (DPTA) of PTM-based CIL. For each incremental learning task, an adapter module is built to fine-tune the PTM, where the center-adapt loss forces the representation to be more centrally clustered and class separable. The dual prototype network improves the prediction process by enabling test-time adapter selection, where the raw prototypes deduce several possible task indexes of test samples to select suitable adapter modules for PTM, and the augmented prototypes that could separate highly correlated classes are utilized to determine the final result. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the excellent performance of DPTA.

Existing methods, primarily based on regularization techniques like knowledge distillation, help preserve old knowledge but often face challenges in effectively integrating new knowledge, resulting in limited overall improvement. Endpoints Weight Fusion (EWF) method, while simple, effectively addresses some of these limitations by dynamically fusing the model weights from previous steps with those from the current step, using a fusion parameter alpha determined by the relative number of previously known classes and newly introduced classes. However, the simplicity of the alpha calculation may limit its ability to fully capture the complexities of different task scenarios, potentially leading to suboptimal fusion outcomes. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach called Adaptive Weight Fusion (AWF), which introduces an alternating training strategy for the fusion parameter, allowing for more flexible and adaptive weight integration. AWF achieves superior performance by better balancing the retention of old knowledge with the learning of new classes, significantly improving results on benchmark CISS tasks compared to the original EWF. And our experiment code will be released on Github.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Prototype Calibration of Vision-Language Models for Generalized Few-shot Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22979v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) aims to extend a segmentation model to novel classes with only a few annotated examples while maintaining performance on base classes. Recently, pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve generalization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning. However, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic, limiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples, particularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we propose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over multi-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive prototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype calibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable visual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive representation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning techniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these calibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and uncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to limited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental results on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed FewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS and class-incremental setting.

Existing methods face a critical dilemma: static architectures rely on a fixed parameter space to learn from data that arrive sequentially, prone to overfitting to the current session, while dynamic architectures require the expansion of the parameter space continually, leading to increased complexity. In this study, we explore the potential of Selective State Space Models (SSMs) for FSCIL. Mamba leverages its input-dependent parameters to dynamically adjust its processing patterns and generate content-aware scan patterns within a fixed architecture. This enables it to configure distinct processing for base and novel classes, effectively preserving existing knowledge while adapting to new ones. To leverage Mamba's potential for FSCIL, we design two key modules: First, we propose a dual selective SSM projector that dynamically adjusts the projection parameters based on the intermediate features for dynamic adaptation. The dual-design structurally decouples base and novel class processing with a frozen base branch, employing a frozen base branch to maintain robust base-class features and a dynamic incremental branch that adaptively learns distinctive feature shifts for novel classes. Second, we develop a class-sensitive selective scan mechanism to guide dynamic adaptation of the incremental branch. It minimizes the disruption to base-class representations caused by training on novel data, and meanwhile, forces the selective scan to perform in distinct patterns between base and novel classes. Extensive experiments on miniImageNet, CUB-200, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that Mamba-FSCIL achieves state-of-the-art performance.
