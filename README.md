| **[CineScene: Implicit 3D as Effective Scene Representation for Cinematic Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06959v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cinematic video production requires control over scene-subject composition and camera movement, but live-action shooting remains costly due to the need for constructing physical sets. To address this, we introduce the task of cinematic video generation with decoupled scene context: given multiple images of a static environment, the goal is to synthesize high-quality videos featuring dynamic subject while preserving the underlying scene consistency and following a user-specified camera trajectory. We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories. Experiments show that CineScene achieves state-of-the-art performance in scene-consistent cinematic video generation, handling large camera movements and demonstrating generalization across diverse environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://karine-huang.github.io/CineScene/</p></details> |

To overcome this, the study proposes an enhanced workflow based on the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)-a transparent, state-of-the-art implementation of the GA2M algorithm-optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and preprocessing refinement. Rather than relying on conventional sampling techniques that may introduce bias or cause information loss, the optimized EBM achieves an effective balance between accuracy and interpretability, enabling precise detection of fraudulent transactions while providing actionable insights into feature importance and interaction effects. Furthermore, the Taguchi method is employed to optimize both the sequence of data scalers and model hyperparameters, ensuring robust, reproducible, and systematically validated performance improvements. Experimental evaluation on benchmark credit card data yields an ROC-AUC of 0.983, surpassing prior EBM baselines (0.975) and outperforming Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models.

As a result, most of the methods reported in the literature deliver non-deterministic partitions that are sensitive to initialization, seed order, and threshold heuristics. We propose PANC, a weakly supervised spectral segmentation framework that uses a minimal set of annotated visual tokens to produce stable, controllable, and reproducible object masks. From the TokenCut approach, we augment the token-token affinity graph with a handful of priors coupled to anchor nodes. By manipulating the graph topology, we bias the spectral eigenspace toward partitions that are consistent with the annotations. Our approach preserves the global grouping enforced by dense self-supervised visual features, trading annotated tokens for significant gains in reproducibility, user control, and segmentation quality. Using 5 to 30 annotations per dataset, our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art performance among weakly and unsupervised approaches on standard benchmarks (e.g., DUTS-TE, ECSSD, MS COCO). Contrarily, it excels in domains where dense labels are costly or intra-class differences are subtle. We report strong and reliable results on homogeneous, fine-grained, and texture-limited domains, achieving 96.8% (+14.43% over SotA), 78.0% (+0.2%), and 78.8% (+0.37%) average mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) on CrackForest (CFD), CUB-200-2011, and HAM10000 datasets, respectively. For multi-object benchmarks, the framework showcases explicit, user-controllable semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learning a Generative Meta-Model of LLM Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06964v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches for analyzing neural network activations, such as PCA and sparse autoencoders, rely on strong structural assumptions. Generative models offer an alternative: they can uncover structure without such assumptions and act as priors that improve intervention fidelity. We explore this direction by training diffusion models on one billion residual stream activations, creating "meta-models" that learn the distribution of a network's internal states. We find that diffusion loss decreases smoothly with compute and reliably predicts downstream utility. In particular, applying the meta-model's learned prior to steering interventions improves fluency, with larger gains as loss decreases. Moreover, the meta-model's neurons increasingly isolate concepts into individual units, with sparse probing scores that scale as loss decreases. These results suggest generative meta-models offer a scalable path toward interpretability without restrictive structural assumptions.

| **[DAWN: Dependency-Aware Fast Inference for Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06953v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown advantages in text generation, particularly due to their inherent ability for parallel decoding. However, constrained by the quality--speed trade-off, existing inference solutions adopt conservative parallel strategies, leaving substantial efficiency potential underexplored. A core challenge is that parallel decoding assumes each position can be filled independently, but tokens are often semantically coupled. Thus, the correct choice at one position constrains valid choices at others. Without modeling these inter-token dependencies, parallel strategies produce deteriorated outputs. Motivated by this insight, we propose DAWN, a training-free, dependency-aware decoding method for fast dLLM inference. DAWN extracts token dependencies and leverages two key motivations: (1) positions dependent on unmasked certain positions become more reliable, (2) simultaneously unmasking strongly coupled uncertain positions induces errors. Given those findings, DAWN leverages a dependency graph to select more reliable unmasking positions at each iteration, achieving high parallelism with negligible loss in generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that DAWN speedups the inference by 1.80-8.06x over baselines while preserving the generation quality. Code is released at https://github.com/lizhuo-luo/DAWN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dataset Distillation as Pushforward Optimal Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07681v3)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation aims to find a synthetic training set such that training on the synthetic data achieves similar performance to training on real data, with orders of magnitude less computational requirements. Existing methods can be broadly categorized as either bi-level optimization problems that have neural network training heuristics as the lower level problem, or disentangled methods that bypass the bi-level optimization by matching distributions of data. The latter method has the major advantages of speed and scalability in terms of size of both training and distilled datasets. We demonstrate that when equipped with an encoder-decoder structure, the empirically successful disentangled methods can be reformulated as an optimal quantization problem, where a finite set of points is found to approximate the underlying probability measure by minimizing the expected projection distance. In particular, we link existing disentangled dataset distillation methods to the classical optimal quantization and Wasserstein barycenter problems, demonstrating consistency of distilled datasets for diffusion-based generative priors. We propose Dataset Distillation by Optimal Quantization, based on clustering in a latent space. Compared to the previous SOTA method D\textsuperscript{4}M, we achieve better performance and inter-model generalization on the ImageNet-1K dataset with trivial additional computation, and SOTA performance in higher image-per-class settings. Using the distilled noise initializations in a stronger diffusion transformer model, we obtain SOTA distillation performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets, outperforming diffusion guidance methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026, https://openreview.net/forum?id=FMSp8AUF3m</p></details> |

| **[Continuous-time reinforcement learning: ellipticity enables model-free value function approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06930v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study off-policy reinforcement learning for controlling continuous-time Markov diffusion processes with discrete-time observations and actions. We consider model-free algorithms with function approximation that learn value and advantage functions directly from data, without unrealistic structural assumptions on the dynamics. Leveraging the ellipticity of the diffusions, we establish a new class of Hilbert-space positive definiteness and boundedness properties for the Bellman operators. Based on these properties, we propose the Sobolev-prox fitted $q$-learning algorithm, which learns value and advantage functions by iteratively solving least-squares regression problems. We derive oracle inequalities for the estimation error, governed by (i) the best approximation error of the function classes, (ii) their localized complexity, (iii) exponentially decaying optimization error, and (iv) numerical discretization error. These results identify ellipticity as a key structural property that renders reinforcement learning with function approximation for Markov diffusions no harder than supervised learning.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry, we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for comprehensive 3D completion.

To address this, we introduce the task of cinematic video generation with decoupled scene context: given multiple images of a static environment, the goal is to synthesize high-quality videos featuring dynamic subject while preserving the underlying scene consistency and following a user-specified camera trajectory. We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories. Experiments show that CineScene achieves state-of-the-art performance in scene-consistent cinematic video generation, handling large camera movements and demonstrating generalization across diverse environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://karine-huang.github.io/CineScene/</p></details> |

| **[Distributed Knowledge in Simplicial Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06945v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The usual semantics of multi-agent epistemic logic is based on Kripke models, defined in terms of binary relations on a set of possible worlds. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using simplicial complexes rather than graphs, as models for multi-agent epistemic logic. This approach uses agents' views as the fundamental object instead of worlds. A set of views by different agents about a world forms a simplex, and a set of simplexes defines a simplicial complex, that can serve as a model for multi-agent epistemic logic. This new approach reveals topological information that is implicit in Kripke models, because the binary indistinguishability relations are more clearly seen as n-ary relations in the simplicial complex. This paper, written for an economics audience, introduces simplicial models to non-experts and connects distributed computing, epistemic logic and topology. Our focus is on distributed knowledge and its fixed point, common distributed knowledge. These concepts arise when considering the knowledge that a group of agents would acquire, if they could communicate their local knowledge perfectly. While common knowledge has been shown to be related to consensus, we illustrate how distributed knowledge is related to a task weaker to consensus, called majority consensus. We describe three models of communication, some well-known (immediate snapshot), and others less studied (related to broadcast and test-and-set). When majority consensus is solvable, we describe the distributed knowledge that is used to solve it. When it is not solvable, we present a logical obstruction, a formula that should always be known according to the task specification, but which the players cannot know.</p></details> |  |

GLP was designed as a language for grassroots platforms -- distributed systems with multiple instances that can operate independently of each other and of any global resource, and can coalesce into ever larger instances -- with its target architecture being smartphones communicating peer-to-peer. The operational semantics of Concurrent (single-agent) GLP and of multiagent GLP (maGLP) were defined via transition systems/multiagent transition systems, respectively. Here, we describe the mathematics developed to facilitate the workstation- and smartphone-based implementations of GLP by AI in Dart. We developed dGLP -- implementation-ready deterministic operational semantics for single-agent GLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the Concurrent GLP operational semantics; dGLP was used by AI as a formal spec, from which it developed a workstation-based implementation of GLP. We developed madGLP -- an implementation-ready multiagent operational semantics for maGLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the maGLP operational semantics; madGLP is deterministic at the agent level (not at the system level due to communication asynchrony), and is being used by AI as a formal spec from which it develops a smartphone-based implementation of maGLP.</p></details> |  |

| **[Topological Semantics for Common Inductive Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06927v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lewis' account of common knowledge in Convention describes the generation of higher-order expectations between agents as hinging upon agents' inductive standards and a shared witness. This paper attempts to draw from insights in learning theory to provide a formal account of common inductive knowledge and how it can be generated by a witness. Our language has a rather rich syntax in order to capture equally rich notions central to Lewis' account of common knowledge; for instance, we speak of an agent 'having some reason to believe' a proposition and one proposition 'indicating' to an agent that another proposition holds. A similar line of work was pursued by Cubitt & Sugden 2003; however, their account was left wanting for a corresponding semantics. Our syntax affords a novel topological semantics which, following Kelly 1996's approach in The Logic of Reliable Inquiry, takes as primitives agents' information bases. In particular, we endow each agent with a 'switching tolerance' meant to represent their personal inductive standards for learning. Curiously, when all agents are truly inductive learners (not choosing to believe only those propositions which are deductively verified), we show that the set of worlds where a proposition $P$ is common inductive knowledge is invariant of agents' switching tolerances. Contrarily, the question of whether a specific witness $W$ generates common inductive knowledge of $P$ is sensitive to changing agents' switching tolerances. After establishing soundness of our proof system with respect to this semantics, we conclude by applying our logic to solve an 'inductive' variant of the coordinated attack problem.</p></details> | 30 pages |

To address this, we introduce the task of cinematic video generation with decoupled scene context: given multiple images of a static environment, the goal is to synthesize high-quality videos featuring dynamic subject while preserving the underlying scene consistency and following a user-specified camera trajectory. We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories. Experiments show that CineScene achieves state-of-the-art performance in scene-consistent cinematic video generation, handling large camera movements and demonstrating generalization across diverse environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://karine-huang.github.io/CineScene/</p></details> |
| **[Improving Credit Card Fraud Detection with an Optimized Explainable Boosting Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06955v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Addressing class imbalance is a central challenge in credit card fraud detection, as it directly impacts predictive reliability in real-world financial systems. To overcome this, the study proposes an enhanced workflow based on the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)-a transparent, state-of-the-art implementation of the GA2M algorithm-optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and preprocessing refinement. Rather than relying on conventional sampling techniques that may introduce bias or cause information loss, the optimized EBM achieves an effective balance between accuracy and interpretability, enabling precise detection of fraudulent transactions while providing actionable insights into feature importance and interaction effects. Furthermore, the Taguchi method is employed to optimize both the sequence of data scalers and model hyperparameters, ensuring robust, reproducible, and systematically validated performance improvements. Experimental evaluation on benchmark credit card data yields an ROC-AUC of 0.983, surpassing prior EBM baselines (0.975) and outperforming Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models. These results highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning and data-driven optimization for advancing trustworthy fraud analytics in financial systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
