| **[Decoding and Engineering the Phytobiome Communication for Smart Agriculture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03584v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart agriculture applications, integrating technologies like the Internet of Things and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) into agriculture, hold promise to address modern challenges of rising food demand, environmental pollution, and water scarcity. Alongside the concept of the phytobiome, which defines the area including the plant, its environment, and associated organisms, and the recent emergence of molecular communication (MC), there exists an important opportunity to advance agricultural science and practice using communication theory. In this article, we motivate to use the communication engineering perspective for developing a holistic understanding of the phytobiome communication and bridge the gap between the phytobiome communication and smart agriculture. Firstly, an overview of phytobiome communication via molecular and electrophysiological signals is presented and a multi-scale framework modeling the phytobiome as a communication network is conceptualized. Then, how this framework is used to model electrophysiological signals is demonstrated with plant experiments. Furthermore, possible smart agriculture applications, such as smart irrigation and targeted delivery of agrochemicals, through engineering the phytobiome communication are proposed. These applications merge ML/AI methods with the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things enabled by MC and pave the way towards more efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly agricultural production. Finally, the implementation challenges, open research issues, and industrial outlook for these applications are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under revision for IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Neural Network applications to Protein Binding Affinity Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03446v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binding energy is a fundamental thermodynamic property that governs molecular interactions, playing a crucial role in fields such as healthcare and the natural sciences. It is particularly relevant in drug development, vaccine design, and other biomedical applications. Over the years, various methods have been developed to estimate protein binding energy, ranging from experimental techniques to computational approaches, with machine learning making significant contributions to this field. Although classical computing has demonstrated strong results in constructing predictive models, the variation of quantum computing for machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative. Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have gained traction as a research focus, raising the question of their potential advantages in predicting binding energies. To investigate this potential, this study explored the feasibility of QNNs for this task by proposing thirty variations of multilayer perceptron-based quantum neural networks. These variations span three distinct architectures, each incorporating ten different quantum circuits to configure their quantum layers. The performance of these quantum models was compared with that of a state-of-the-art classical multilayer perceptron-based artificial neural network, evaluating both accuracy and training time. A primary dataset was used for training, while two additional datasets containing entirely unseen samples were employed for testing. Results indicate that the quantum models achieved approximately 20% higher accuracy on one unseen dataset, although their accuracy was lower on the other datasets. Notably, quantum models exhibited training times several orders of magnitude shorter than their classical counterparts, highlighting their potential for efficient protein binding energy prediction.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[An Auditable Agent Platform For Automated Molecular Optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03444v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery frequently loses momentum when data, expertise, and tools are scattered, slowing design cycles. To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical, tool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal Researcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target information, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to molecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a docking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic polices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full reasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise provenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule centered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in context learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein using five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking score, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then compared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three configurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an architectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding optimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast, single agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the cost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet their lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning paths unverified. These results show that test time scaling, focused feedback loops and provenance convert general purpose LLMs into auditable systems for molecular design, and suggest that extending the toolset to ADMET and selectivity predictors could push research workflows further along the discovery pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Potential Score Matching: Debiasing Molecular Structure Sampling with Potential Energy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14569v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoTox: Chain-of-Thought-Based Molecular Toxicity Reasoning and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03159v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale. To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO) terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support early-stage drug safety assessment. The code and prompt used in this work are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/CoTox.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03111v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting, it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.</p></details> |  |

| **[MolReasoner: Toward Effective and Interpretable Reasoning for Molecular LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02066v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics, while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT) samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently, Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions, thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[BSL: A Unified and Generalizable Multitask Learning Platform for Virtual Drug Discovery from Design to Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01195v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health, prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced, open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery, offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor, successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery. The platform is accessible at https://www.baishenglai.net.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolPIF: A Parameter Interpolation Flow Model for Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13762v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space. However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore, the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design, demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for model design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Super-resolution Inspired Electron Density Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12335v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drawing inspiration from the domain of image super-resolution, we view the electron density as a 3D grayscale image and use a convolutional residual network to transform a crude and trivially generated guess of the molecular density into an accurate ground-state quantum mechanical density. We find that this model outperforms all prior density prediction approaches. Because the input is itself a real-space density, the predictions are equivariant to molecular symmetry transformations even though the model is not constructed to be. Due to its simplicity, the model is directly applicable to unseen molecular conformations and chemical elements. We show that fine-tuning on limited new data provides high accuracy even in challenging cases of exotic elements and charge states. Our work suggests new routes to learning real-space physical quantities drawing from the established ideas of image processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Representation Condition Improves Equivariant Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03655v4)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in molecular generative models have demonstrated great promise for accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often struggle to generate high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to improve molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared with single-stage generation, the easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second stage generation toward a high-quality molecule in a goal-oriented way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 50\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations. Furthermore, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly reducing the generation iterations needed.

| **[Look the Other Way: Designing 'Positive' Molecules with Negative Data via Task Arithmetic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17876v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive' molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions' $--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules. Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning strategy for de novo molecule design.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenMol: A Drug Discovery Generalist with Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06158v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is a complex process that involves multiple stages and tasks. However, existing molecular generative models can only tackle some of these tasks. We present Generalist Molecular generative model (GenMol), a versatile framework that uses only a single discrete diffusion model to handle diverse drug discovery scenarios. GenMol generates Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing the utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering while having better sampling efficiency. GenMol uses fragments as basic building blocks for molecules and introduces fragment remasking, a strategy that optimizes molecules by regenerating masked fragments, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. We further propose molecular context guidance (MCG), a guidance method tailored for masked discrete diffusion of GenMol. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model in de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization. These results demonstrate that GenMol can tackle a wide range of drug discovery tasks, providing a unified and versatile approach for molecular design. Our code is available at https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/genmol.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Aligned Manifold Property and Topology Point Clouds for Learning Molecular Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16223v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models for molecular property prediction generally rely on representations -- such as SMILES strings and molecular graphs -- that overlook the surface-local phenomena driving intermolecular behavior. 3D-based approaches often reduce surface detail or require computationally expensive SE(3)-equivariant architectures to manage spatial variance. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces AMPTCR (Aligned Manifold Property and Topology Cloud Representation), a molecular surface representation that combines local quantum-derived scalar fields and custom topological descriptors within an aligned point cloud format. Each surface point includes a chemically meaningful scalar, geodesically derived topology vectors, and coordinates transformed into a canonical reference frame, enabling efficient learning with conventional SE(3)-sensitive architectures. AMPTCR is evaluated using a DGCNN framework on two tasks: molecular weight and bacterial growth inhibition. For molecular weight, results confirm that AMPTCR encodes physically meaningful data, with a validation R^2 of 0.87. In the bacterial inhibition task, AMPTCR enables both classification and direct regression of E. coli inhibition values using Dual Fukui functions as the electronic descriptor and Morgan Fingerprints as auxiliary data, achieving an ROC AUC of 0.912 on the classification task, and an R^2 of 0.54 on the regression task. These results help demonstrate that AMPTCR offers a compact, expressive, and architecture-agnostic representation for modeling surface-mediated molecular properties.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[BARNN: A Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18665v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive and recurrent networks have achieved remarkable progress across various fields, from weather forecasting to molecular generation and Large Language Models. Despite their strong predictive capabilities, these models lack a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty, which is key in scientific applications such as PDE solving, molecular generation and Machine Learning Force Fields. To address this shortcoming we present BARNN: a variational Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network. BARNNs aim to provide a principled way to turn any autoregressive or recurrent model into its Bayesian version. BARNN is based on the variational dropout method, allowing to apply it to large recurrent neural networks as well. We also introduce a temporal version of the "Variational Mixtures of Posteriors" prior (tVAMP-prior) to make Bayesian inference efficient and well-calibrated. Extensive experiments on PDE modelling and molecular generation demonstrate that BARNN not only achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, but also excels in uncertainty quantification and modelling long-range dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoDyGAN: Combining Molecular Dynamics With GANs to Investigate Protein Conformational Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13950v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensively exploring protein conformational landscapes remains a major challenge in computational biology due to the high computational cost involved in dynamic physics-based simulations. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational spaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into MD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble learning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of generated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative representation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into 2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use three rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new conformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that interpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that representing proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying advanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an efficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed framework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computing and Bounding Equilibrium Concentrations in Athermic Chemical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12699v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing equilibrium concentrations of molecular complexes is generally analytically intractable and requires numerical approaches. In this work we focus on the polymer-monomer level, where indivisible molecules (monomers) combine to form complexes (polymers). Rather than employing free-energy parameters for each polymer, we focus on the athermic setting where all interactions preserve enthalpy. This setting aligns with the strongly bonded (domain-based) regime in DNA nanotechnology when strands can bind in different ways, but always with maximum overall bonding -- and is consistent with the saturated configurations in the Thermodynamic Binding Networks (TBNs) model. Within this context, we develop an iterative algorithm for assigning polymer concentrations to satisfy detailed-balance, where on-target (desired) polymers are in high concentrations and off-target (undesired) polymers are in low. Even if not directly executed, our algorithm provides effective insights into upper bounds on concentration of off-target polymers, connecting combinatorial arguments about discrete configurations such as those in the TBN model to real-valued concentrations. We conclude with an application of our method to decreasing leak in DNA logic and signal propagation. Our results offer a new framework for design and verification of equilibrium concentrations when configurations are distinguished by entropic forces.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in DNA31 (31st International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming)</p></details> |

While recent developments in synthesizable molecule generation have demonstrated promising results, these efforts have been largely confined to 2D molecular graph representations, limiting the ability to perform geometry-based conditional generation. In this work, we present SynCoGen (Synthesizable Co-Generation), a single framework that combines simultaneous masked graph diffusion and flow matching for synthesizable 3D molecule generation. SynCoGen samples from the joint distribution of molecular building blocks, chemical reactions, and atomic coordinates. To train the model, we curated SynSpace, a dataset containing over 600K synthesis-aware building block graphs and 3.3M conformers. SynCoGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional small molecule graph and conformer generation, and the model delivers competitive performance in zero-shot molecular linker design for protein ligand generation in drug discovery. Overall, this multimodal formulation represents a foundation for future applications enabled by non-autoregressive molecular generation, including analog expansion, lead optimization, and direct structure conditioning.</p></details> |  |

| **[S2FGL: Spatial Spectral Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02409v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the semantic knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drift occurs, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate the challenge of poor semantic knowledge caused by label signal disruption. Furthermore, we design a frequency alignment to address spectral client drift. The combination of Spatial and Spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[GaitAdapt: Continual Learning for Evolving Gait Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03375v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt, which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks, thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[BriLLM: Brain-inspired Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11299v6)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce BriLLM, a brain-inspired large language model that redefines the foundations of generative language modeling. Departing from Transformer architectures, GPT frameworks, and traditional input-output constrained paradigms, BriLLM is built on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) mechanism - a directed graph-based neural network design that enables full interpretability across all nodes, in contrast to conventional models limited to input-output interpretability. In this framework, tokens are represented as graph nodes, with signal flows - either randomly initialized or user-defined - propagating along paths following a "least resistance" principle. The next token to be generated emerges as the target of this signal flow. Theoretically, BriLLM supports infinitely long n-gram modeling, with model size decoupled from input and prediction length. Its signal propagation dynamics mimic human-like cognitive patterns, enabling recall activation and inherent multi-modal compatibility. We release initial Chinese and English BriLLM versions (4000 tokens, 32-dimensional nodes, 32-token sequence prediction capacity) with sizes ~2B and ~1B parameters, respectively, achieving performance comparable to GPT-1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterophily-Aware Fair Recommendation using Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03365v4)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to improve the accuracy and performance of recommender systems. Modern recommender systems are not only designed to serve end users, but also to benefit other participants, such as items and item providers. These participants may have different or conflicting goals and interests, which raises the need for fairness and popularity bias considerations. GNN-based recommendation methods also face the challenges of unfairness and popularity bias, and their normalization and aggregation processes suffer from these challenges. In this paper, we propose a fair GNN-based recommender system, called HetroFair, to improve item-side fairness. HetroFair uses two separate components to generate fairness-aware embeddings: i) Fairness-aware attention, which incorporates the dot product in the normalization process of GNNs to decrease the effect of nodes' degrees. ii) Heterophily feature weighting, to assign distinct weights to different features during the aggregation process. To evaluate the effectiveness of HetroFair, we conduct extensive experiments over six real-world datasets. Our experimental results reveal that HetroFair not only alleviates unfairness and popularity bias on the item side but also achieves superior accuracy on the user side. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/NematGH/HetroFair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Continual Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03283v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The aim of Continual Learning (CL) is to learn new tasks incrementally while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Online Continual Learning (OCL) specifically focuses on learning efficiently from a continuous stream of data with shifting distribution. While recent studies explore Continual Learning on graphs exploiting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), only few of them focus on a streaming setting. Yet, many real-world graphs evolve over time, often requiring timely and online predictions. Current approaches, however, are not well aligned with the standard OCL setting, partly due to the lack of a clear definition of online Continual Learning on graphs. In this work, we propose a general formulation for online Continual Learning on graphs, emphasizing the efficiency requirements on batch processing over the graph topology, and providing a well-defined setting for systematic model evaluation. Finally, we introduce a set of benchmarks and report the performance of several methods in the CL literature, adapted to our setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness -- some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second, predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph. ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Information Bottleneck-Guided Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Interpretable Neurodevelopmental Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20769v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing interpretable models for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) diagnosis presents significant challenges in effectively encoding, decoding, and integrating multimodal neuroimaging data. While many existing machine learning approaches have shown promise in brain network analysis, they typically suffer from limited interpretability, particularly in extracting meaningful biomarkers from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and establishing clear relationships between imaging features and demographic characteristics. Besides, current graph neural network methodologies face limitations in capturing both local and global functional connectivity patterns while simultaneously achieving theoretically principled multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a unified framework that applies information bottleneck principles to guide both brain connectivity modeling and cross-modal feature integration. This framework comprises two complementary components. The first is the Information Bottleneck Graph Transformer (IBGraphFormer), which combines transformer-based global attention mechanisms with graph neural networks through information bottleneck-guided pooling to identify sufficient biomarkers. The second is the Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (IB-HGAN), which employs meta-path-based heterogeneous graph learning with structural consistency constraints to achieve interpretable fusion of neuroimaging and demographic data. The experimental results demonstrate that I2B-HGNN achieves superior performance in diagnosing NDDs, exhibiting both high classification accuracy and the ability to provide interpretable biomarker identification while effectively analyzing non-imaging data.</p></details> |  |

A necessary enabler to this capability is to find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods, such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates, whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Pr...</summary><p>in Proc. 75th Int.

| **[GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03111v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting, it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Spectral Graph Neural Networks with LLM-Predicted Homophily](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14220v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in tasks such as node classification due to their ability to learn flexible filters. Typically, these filters are learned under the supervision of downstream tasks, enabling SGNNs to adapt to diverse structural patterns. However, in scenarios with limited labeled data, SGNNs often struggle to capture the optimal filter shapes, resulting in degraded performance, especially on graphs with heterophily. Meanwhile, the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for enhancing graph learning without modifying graph structure or requiring task-specific training. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages LLMs to estimate the homophily level of a graph and uses this global structural prior to guide the construction of spectral filters. Specifically, we design a lightweight and plug-and-play pipeline where a small set of labeled node pairs is formatted as natural language prompts for the LLM, which then predicts the graph's homophily ratio. This estimated value informs the spectral filter basis, enabling SGNNs to adapt more effectively to both homophilic and heterophilic structures. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our LLM-assisted spectral framework consistently improves performance over strong SGNN baselines. Importantly, this enhancement incurs negligible computational and monetary cost, making it a practical solution for real-world graph applications.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated results using the model trained on the ALEX-MP-20 dataset. 13+14 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |

In addition to users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged by other large-scale industrial models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02600v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces, struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training, we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover, the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Contextual Graph Transformer: A Small Language Model for Enhanced Engineering Document Information Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02532v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text, often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering. CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram, and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical domains often require specialized language models with stronger contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7% higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented responses in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Structure Sharing Empowers Multi-task Heterogeneous GNNs for Customer Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22089v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customer expansion, i.e., growing a business existing customer base by acquiring new customers, is critical for scaling operations and sustaining the long-term profitability of logistics companies. Although state-of-the-art works model this task as a single-node classification problem under a heterogeneous graph learning framework and achieve good performance, they struggle with extremely positive label sparsity issues in our scenario. Multi-task learning (MTL) offers a promising solution by introducing a correlated, label-rich task to enhance the label-sparse task prediction through knowledge sharing. However, existing MTL methods result in performance degradation because they fail to discriminate task-shared and task-specific structural patterns across tasks. This issue arises from their limited consideration of the inherently complex structure learning process of heterogeneous graph neural networks, which involves the multi-layer aggregation of multi-type relations. To address the challenge, we propose a Structure-Aware Hierarchical Information Sharing Framework (SrucHIS), which explicitly regulates structural information sharing across tasks in logistics customer expansion. SrucHIS breaks down the structure learning phase into multiple stages and introduces sharing mechanisms at each stage, effectively mitigating the influence of task-specific structural patterns during each stage. We evaluate StrucHIS on both private and public datasets, achieving a 51.41% average precision improvement on the private dataset and a 10.52% macro F1 gain on the public dataset. StrucHIS is further deployed at one of the largest logistics companies in China and demonstrates a 41.67% improvement in the success contract-signing rate over existing strategies, generating over 453K new orders within just two months.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Finite Element Method (FEM)-based simulations, while accurate, are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time scenarios. Learning-based approaches have shown promise in accelerating predictions but have fallen short in modeling soft-rigid interactions effectively. We introduce MIXPINN, a physics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for mixed-material simulations, explicitly capturing soft-rigid interactions using graph-based augmentations. Our approach integrates Virtual Nodes (VNs) and Virtual Edges (VEs) to enhance rigid body constraint satisfaction while preserving computational efficiency. By leveraging a graph-based representation of biomechanical structures, MIXPINN learns high-fidelity deformations from FEM-generated data and achieves real-time inference with sub-millimeter accuracy. We validate our method in a realistic clinical scenario, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline GNN models and traditional FEM methods. Our results show that MIXPINN reduces computational cost by an order of magnitude while maintaining high physical accuracy, making it a viable solution for real-time surgical simulation and robotic-assisted procedures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

While traditional network management approaches will suffice, an automated solutions are becoming a must. However, network automation frameworks are prone to errors, and often they employ ML-based techniques that require training to learn how the network can be optimized. In this sense, network digital twins are a useful tool that allows for the simulation, testing, and training of AI models without affecting the real-world networks and users. This paper presents an AI-based Network Digital Twin (AI-NDT) that leverages a multi-layered knowledge graph architecture and graph neural networks to predict network metrics that directly affect the quality of experience of users. An evaluation of the four most prominent Graph Neural Networks (GNN) architectures was conducted to assess their effectiveness in developing network digital twins. We trained the digital twin on publicly available measurement data from RIPE Atlas, therefore obtaining results close to what is expected in real-world applications. The results show that among the four architectures evaluated, GraphTransformer presents the best performance. However, other architectures might fit better in scenarios where shorter training time is important, while also delivering acceptable results. The results of this work are indicative of what might become common practice for proactive network management, offering a scalable and accurate solution aligned with the requirements of the next-generation networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Skeleton-Guided Learning for Shortest Path Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02270v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage. Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for learning-based shortest path search.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional statistical methods struggle with nonlinear effects, while machine learning models often fail to capture geographical (nearby areas being more similar) and topological (unequal connectivity between places) effects in an interpretable way. To address this, we propose MedGNN, a spatio-topologically explicit framework that constructs a 2-hop spatial graph, integrating positional and locational node embeddings with urban characteristics in a graph neural network. Applied to MEDSAT, a comprehensive dataset covering over 150 environmental and socio-demographic factors and six prescription outcomes (depression, anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and opioids) across 4,835 Greater London neighborhoods, MedGNN improved predictions by over 25% on average compared to baseline methods. Using depression prescriptions as a case study, we analyzed graph embeddings via geographical principal component analysis, identifying findings that: align with prior research (e.g., higher antidepressant prescriptions among older and White populations), contribute to ongoing debates (e.g., greenery linked to higher and NO2 to lower prescriptions), and warrant further study (e.g., canopy evaporation correlated with fewer prescriptions). These results demonstrate MedGNN's potential, and more broadly, of carefully applied machine learning, to advance transdisciplinary public health research.</p></details> |  |

Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic 4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence, and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation and simulation.

While recent diffusion-based models achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 10 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially, complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion; and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism (CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency, while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 10 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of extracting sensitive training examples from diffusion models, with conditional diffusion models exhibiting a stronger tendency to memorize and leak information. In this work, we investigate data memorization and extraction risks in CLIP through the lens of CLIP inversion, a process that aims to reconstruct training images from text prompts. To this end, we introduce \textbf{LeakyCLIP}, a novel attack framework designed to achieve high-quality, semantically accurate image reconstruction from CLIP embeddings. We identify three key challenges in CLIP inversion: 1) non-robust features, 2) limited visual semantics in text embeddings, and 3) low reconstruction fidelity. To address these challenges, LeakyCLIP employs 1) adversarial fine-tuning to enhance optimization smoothness, 2) linear transformation-based embedding alignment, and 3) Stable Diffusion-based refinement to improve fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of LeakyCLIP, achieving over 358% improvement in Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) for ViT-B-16 compared to baseline methods on LAION-2B subset. Furthermore, we uncover a pervasive leakage risk, showing that training data membership can even be successfully inferred from the metrics of low-fidelity reconstructions. Our work introduces a practical method for CLIP inversion while offering novel insights into the nature and scope of privacy risks in multimodal models.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiWA: Diffusion Policy Adaptation with World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03645v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency, making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)</p></details> |
| **[Likelihood Matching for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03636v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a Likelihood Matching approach for training diffusion models by first establishing an equivalence between the likelihood of the target data distribution and a likelihood along the sample path of the reverse diffusion. To efficiently compute the reverse sample likelihood, a quasi-likelihood is considered to approximate each reverse transition density by a Gaussian distribution with matched conditional mean and covariance, respectively. The score and Hessian functions for the diffusion generation are estimated by maximizing the quasi-likelihood, ensuring a consistent matching of both the first two transitional moments between every two time points. A stochastic sampler is introduced to facilitate computation that leverages on both the estimated score and Hessian information. We establish consistency of the quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, and provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for the proposed sampler, quantifying the rates of the approximation errors due to the score and Hessian estimation, dimensionality, and the number of diffusion steps. Empirical and simulation evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Likelihood Matching and validate the theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

Our approach uses a copula-based transformation to flexibly model skewness, heavy tails, and other non-Gaussian features often observed in real data. We rigorously define the process, establish key probabilistic properties, and construct a corresponding diffusion model via stochastic calculus, including proofs of existence and uniqueness. A simplified approximation is introduced and analyzed, with error bounds derived from asymptotic expansions. Simulations demonstrate that both the full and simplified models recover target marginals with high accuracy. Examples using the Student's t, asymmetric Laplace, and Exponentialized Generalized Beta of the Second Kind (EGB2) distributions illustrate the flexibility and tractability of the framework.</p></details> |  |

However, optimizing these models for downstream tasks often involves nested bilevel structures, such as tuning hyperparameters for fine-tuning tasks or noise schedules in training dynamics, where traditional bilevel methods fail due to the infinite-dimensional probability space and prohibitive sampling costs. We formalize this challenge as a generative bilevel optimization problem and address two key scenarios: (1) fine-tuning pre-trained models via an inference-only lower-level solver paired with a sample-efficient gradient estimator for the upper level, and (2) training diffusion model from scratch with noise schedule optimization by reparameterizing the lower-level problem and designing a computationally tractable gradient estimator. Our first-order bilevel framework overcomes the incompatibility of conventional bilevel methods with diffusion processes, offering theoretical grounding and computational practicality. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing fine-tuning and hyperparameter search baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Cameral-ready version: added experiments using the HPSv2 reward, improved notation consistency for the diffusion model, and added related works</p></details> |

To address this issue, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing why caching damage the generation processes. In this paper, we first confirm that the cache greatly amplifies the exposure bias, resulting in a decline in the generation quality. However, directly applying noise scaling is challenging for this issue due to the non-smoothness of exposure bias. We found that this phenomenon stems from the mismatch between its frequency response characteristics and the simple cache of Attention and MLP. Since these two components exhibit unique preferences for frequency signals, which provides us with a caching strategy to separate Attention and MLP to achieve an enhanced fit of exposure bias and reduce it. Based on this, we introduced FEB-Cache, a joint caching strategy that aligns with the non-exposed bias diffusion process (which gives us a higher performance cap) of caching Attention and MLP based on the frequency-guided cache table. Our approach combines a comprehensive understanding of the caching mechanism and offers a new perspective on leveraging caching to accelerate the diffusion process. Empirical results indicate that FEB-Cache optimizes model performance while concurrently facilitating acceleration.</p></details> |  |

A general-purpose robot must be capable of grasping diverse objects in arbitrary scenarios. However, existing research typically relies on restrictive assumptions, such as single-object settings or limited environments, showing constrained generalization. We present DexGraspVLA, a hierarchical framework for robust generalization in language-guided general dexterous grasping and beyond. It utilizes a pre-trained Vision-Language model as the high-level planner and learns a diffusion-based low-level Action controller. The key insight to achieve generalization lies in iteratively transforming diverse language and visual inputs into domain-invariant representations via foundation models, where imitation learning can be effectively applied due to the alleviation of domain shift. Notably, our method achieves a 90+% dexterous grasping success rate under thousands of challenging unseen cluttered scenes. Empirical analysis confirms the consistency of internal model behavior across environmental variations, validating our design. DexGraspVLA also, for the first time, simultaneously demonstrates free-form long-horizon prompt execution, robustness to adversarial objects and human disturbance, and failure recovery. Extended application to nonprehensile grasping further proves its generality. Project website: https://dexgraspvla.github.io.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |

However, detecting pathology in such heterogeneous cohorts is a difficult challenge. Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers a promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is modeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to disease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly detection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and generate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration; differences between the original and restored images highlight potential abnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model approaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important context to guide the disease detection process. Furthermore, standard approaches often poorly restore healthy regions, resulting in poor reconstructions and suboptimal detection performance. We present CADD, the first conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images. To guide the healthy restoration process, we propose a novel inference inpainting strategy which balances anomaly removal with retention of subject-specific features. Evaluated on three challenging datasets, including clinical scans, which may have lower contrast, thicker slices, and motion artifacts, CADD achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities in heterogeneous cohorts.</p></details> |  |

Understanding how the brain perceives and processes 3D visual stimuli in the real world has been a longstanding endeavor in neuroscience. Towards this goal, we introduce a new neuroscience task: decoding 3D visual perception from EEG signals, a neuroimaging technique that enables real-time monitoring of neural dynamics enriched with complex visual cues. To provide the essential benchmark, we first present EEG-3D, a pioneering dataset featuring multimodal analysis data and extensive EEG recordings from 12 subjects viewing 72 categories of 3D objects rendered in both videos and images. Furthermore, we propose Neuro-3D, a 3D visual decoding framework based on EEG signals. This framework adaptively integrates EEG features derived from static and dynamic stimuli to learn complementary and robust neural representations, which are subsequently utilized to recover both the shape and color of 3D objects through the proposed diffusion-based colored point cloud decoder. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore EEG-based 3D visual decoding. Experiments indicate that Neuro-3D not only reconstructs colored 3D objects with high fidelity, but also learns effective neural representations that enable insightful brain region analysis. The dataset and associated code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quality-Aware Language-Conditioned Local Auto-Regressive Anomaly Synthesis and Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03539v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore, inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for emotion-driven artistic creation.

A core contribution is the 'cardinality' map, a novel regression target that accounts for variations in object size and spatial distribution. Leveraging representation alignment and a hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object count estimation and fine-grained guidance for generative models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that YOLO-Count achieves state-of-the-art counting accuracy while providing robust and effective quantity control for T2I systems.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations, including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM25 has accepted this paper</p></details> |

Effectively querying this data is essential to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data, state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories, resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counting Stacked Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19149v4)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual object counting is a fundamental computer vision task underpinning numerous real-world applications, from cell counting in biomedicine to traffic and wildlife monitoring. However, existing methods struggle to handle the challenge of stacked 3D objects in which most objects are hidden by those above them. To address this important yet underexplored problem, we propose a novel 3D counting approach that decomposes the task into two complementary subproblems - estimating the 3D geometry of the object stack and the occupancy ratio from multi-view images. By combining geometric reconstruction and deep learning-based depth analysis, our method can accurately count identical objects within containers, even when they are irregularly stacked. We validate our 3D Counting pipeline on diverse real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets, which we will release publicly to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV2...</summary><p>ICCV25 Oral.

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

Linear combinations of such functions are called graph motif parameters and have recently received significant attention in counting complexity after a seminal paper by Curticapean, Dell and Marx (STOC'17). We show that, among linear combinations of functions #IndSub(H,*) involving only graphs H without isolated vertices, precisely those with positive integer coefficients maintain a combinatorial interpretation. It is important to note that graph motif parameters can be nonnegative for all inputs G, even when some coefficients are negative. Formally, we show that evaluating any graph motif parameter with a negative coefficient is impossible in an oracle variant of #P, where an implicit graph is accessed by oracle queries. Our proof follows the classification of the relativizing closure properties of #P by Hertrampf, Vollmer, and Wagner (SCT'95) and the framework developed by Ikenmeyer and Pak (STOC'22), but our application of the required Ramsey theorem turns out to be more subtle, as graphs do not have the required Ramsey property. Our techniques generalize from graphs to relational structures, including colored graphs. Vastly generalizing this, we introduce motif parameters over categories that count occurrences of sub-objects in the category. We then prove a general dichotomy theorem that characterizes which such parameters have a combinatorial interpretation. Using known results in Ramsey theory for categories, we obtain a dichotomy for motif parameters of finite vector spaces as well as parameter sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, full version</p></details> |

This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity connections across frames. We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models to discriminate between coherent image sequences and stories from unrelated images. We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to teach appropriate entity connection behavior. We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic contexts. Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on Qwen2.5-VL 7B). Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1 from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%). Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except "its", and cross-frame character and object persistence increased across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%). Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story, increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[SQLNet: Scale-Modulated Query and Localization Network for Few-Shot Class-Agnostic Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10011v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The class-agnostic counting (CAC) task has recently been proposed to solve the problem of counting all objects of an arbitrary class with several exemplars given in the input image. To address this challenging task, existing leading methods all resort to density map regression, which renders them impractical for downstream tasks that require object locations and restricts their ability to well explore the scale information of exemplars for supervision. To address the limitations, we propose a novel localization-based CAC approach, termed Scale-modulated Query and Localization Network (SQLNet). It fully explores the scales of exemplars in both the query and localization stages and achieves effective counting by accurately locating each object and predicting its approximate size. Specifically, during the query stage, rich discriminative representations of the target class are acquired by the Hierarchical Exemplars Collaborative Enhancement (HECE) module from the few exemplars through multi-scale exemplar cooperation with equifrequent size prompt embedding. These representations are then fed into the Exemplars-Unified Query Correlation (EUQC) module to interact with the query features in a unified manner and produce the correlated query tensor. In the localization stage, the Scale-aware Multi-head Localization (SAML) module utilizes the query tensor to predict the confidence, location, and size of each potential object. Moreover, a scale-aware localization loss is introduced, which exploits flexible location associations and exemplar scales for supervision to optimize the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SQLNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular CAC benchmarks, achieving excellent performance not only in counting accuracy but also in localization and bounding box generation.

Representative methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness. Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147, CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability for zero-shot class-agnostic counting.

However, when involving generating multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images, resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization capabilities.

In this work, we present the first large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions: (1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3) How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context? Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key areas for improvement in medical visual language models.</p></details> |  |

We release a novel dataset, VAQUUM, containing 20,300 human ratings on quantified statements across a total of 1089 images. Using this dataset, we compare human judgments and VLM predictions using three different evaluation methods. Our findings show that VLMs, like humans, are influenced by object counts in vague quantifier use. However, we find significant inconsistencies across models in different evaluation settings, suggesting that judging and producing vague quantifiers rely on two different processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ACL 2025, 10 pages</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we propose MIRAGE, a multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate models' capabilities in Counting (object attribute recognition), Relation (spatial relational reasoning), and Counting with Relation. Through diverse and complex scenarios requiring fine-grained recognition and reasoning, MIRAGE highlights critical limitations in state-of-the-art models, underscoring the need for improved representations and reasoning frameworks.

| **[On the Theory of Conditional Feature Alignment for Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17137v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object counting models suffer when deployed across domains with differing density variety, since density shifts are inherently task-relevant and violate standard domain adaptation assumptions. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets (e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in unsupervised domain-adaptive counting.

| **[Assembler: Scalable 3D Part Assembly via Anchor Point Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17074v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Assembler, a scalable and generalizable framework for 3D part assembly that reconstructs complete objects from input part meshes and a reference image. Unlike prior approaches that mostly rely on deterministic part pose prediction and category-specific training, Assembler is designed to handle diverse, in-the-wild objects with varying part counts, geometries, and structures. It addresses the core challenges of scaling to general 3D part assembly through innovations in task formulation, representation, and data. First, Assembler casts part assembly as a generative problem and employs diffusion models to sample plausible configurations, effectively capturing ambiguities arising from symmetry, repeated parts, and multiple valid assemblies. Second, we introduce a novel shape-centric representation based on sparse anchor point clouds, enabling scalable generation in Euclidean space rather than SE(3) pose prediction. Third, we construct a large-scale dataset of over 320K diverse part-object assemblies using a synthesis and filtering pipeline built on existing 3D shape repositories. Assembler achieves state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and is the first to demonstrate high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects. Based on Assembler, we further introduce an interesting part-aware 3D modeling system that generates high-resolution, editable objects from images, demonstrating potential for interactive and compositional design.

| **[Open-World Object Counting in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15368v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the CountVid model, and all the code are available at https://github.com/niki-amini-naieni/CountVid/.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViCrit: A Verifiable Reinforcement Learning Proxy Task for Visual Perception in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10128v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle, synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math, showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.</p></details> |  |

UCCT formalizes this process as Bayesian competition between statistical priors learned in pre-training and context-driven target patterns, yielding a single quantitative account that unifies existing adaptation techniques. We ground the theory in three principles: threshold crossing, modality universality, and density-distance predictive power, and validate them with (i) cross-domain demonstrations (text QA, image captioning, multi-agent debate) and (ii) two depth-oriented experiments: a controlled numeral-base study (bases 8, 9, 10) that isolates pattern-density effects, and a layer-wise trajectory analysis that reveals phase transitions inside a 7B-parameter model. Both experiments confirm UCCT's predictions of threshold behavior, asymmetric interference, and memory hysteresis. By showing that LLM ``intelligence'' is created through semantic anchoring rather than contained within the model, UCCT offers a principled foundation for interpretable diagnostics and practical guidance for prompt engineering, model selection, and alignment-centric system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figure, 2 table</p></details> |

However, existing real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific, dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight)</p></details> |

To one extreme, pre-trained encoders convert images into visual tokens, with which objects and spatiotemporal relationships may be implicitly modeled. To the other extreme, image captions by themselves provide strong empirical performances for understanding tasks, despite missing fine-grained spatiotemporal information. To answer this question, we introduce ObjectMLLM, a framework capable of leveraging arbitrary computer vision algorithm to extract and integrate structured visual representation. Through extensive evaluations on six video question answering benchmarks, we confirm that explicit integration of object-centric representation remains necessary. Surprisingly, we observe that the simple approach of quantizing the continuous, structured object information and representing them as plain text performs the best, offering a data-efficient approach to integrate other visual perception modules into MLLM design. Our code and models are released at https://github.com/brown-palm/ObjectMLLM.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term, high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components: Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA, comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87.

We build the first robustness benchmark for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted, lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger defences.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

Therefore, we introduce Llama3-MS-CLIP, the first vision-language model pre-trained with contrastive learning on a large-scale multispectral dataset and report on the performance gains due to the extended spectral range. Furthermore, we present the largest-to-date image-caption dataset for multispectral data, consisting of one million Sentinel-2 samples and corresponding textual descriptions generated using Llama3-LLaVA-Next and Overture Maps data. We develop a scalable captioning pipeline, which is validated by domain experts. We evaluate Llama3-MS-CLIP on multispectral zero-shot image classification and retrieval using three datasets of varying complexity. Our results demonstrate that Llama3-MS-CLIP significantly outperforms other RGB-based approaches, improving classification accuracy by +6.77% on average and retrieval performance by +4.63% mAP compared to the second-best model. Our results emphasize the relevance of multispectral vision-language learning.

Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships. Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision (PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones.

The computational cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method (ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates. Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6% with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

However, such pairs often contain noise, including redundant or irrelevant information on either the image or caption side. To mitigate this issue, we propose MCSEO, a method that enhances multimodal sentence embeddings by incorporating fine-grained object-phrase alignment alongside traditional image-caption alignment. Specifically, MCSEO utilizes existing segmentation and object detection models to extract accurate object-phrase pairs, which are then used to optimize a contrastive learning objective tailored to object-phrase correspondence. Experimental results on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks across different backbone models demonstrate that MCSEO consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the significance of precise object-phrase alignment in multimodal representation learning.</p></details> | Work in progress |

To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{HumaniBench}, a novel benchmark of 32,000 real-world image-question pairs and an evaluation suite. Labels are generated via an AI-assisted pipeline and validated by experts. HumaniBench assesses LMMs across seven key alignment principles: fairness, ethics, empathy, inclusivity, reasoning, robustness, and multilinguality, through diverse open-ended and closed-ended VQA tasks. Grounded in AI ethics and real-world needs, these principles provide a holistic lens for societal impact. Benchmarking results on different LMM shows that proprietary models generally lead in reasoning, fairness, and multilinguality, while open-source models excel in robustness and grounding. Most models struggle to balance accuracy with ethical and inclusive behavior. Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time scaling improve alignment. As the first benchmark tailored for HC alignment, HumaniBench offers a rigorous testbed to diagnose limitations, and promote responsible LMM development. All data and code are publicly available for reproducibility. Keywords: HumaniBench, vision-language models, responsible AI benchmark, AI alignment evaluation, AI ethics assessment, fairness in AI models, visual question answering (VQA) benchmark, image captioning evaluation, visual grounding tasks, trustworthy AI models, Chain-of-Thought prompting, test-time scaling, ethical AI development tools.</p></details> |  |

A significant portion of key information is embedded in molecular structure figures, complicating large-scale literature searches and limiting the application of large language models in fields such as biology, chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. The automatic extraction of precise chemical structures is of critical importance. However, the presence of numerous Markush structures in real-world documents, along with variations in molecular image quality, drawing styles, and noise, significantly limits the performance of existing optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) methods. We present MolParser, a novel end-to-end OCSR method that efficiently and accurately recognizes chemical structures from real-world documents, including difficult Markush structure. We use a extended SMILES encoding rule to annotate our training dataset. Under this rule, we build MolParser-7M, the largest annotated molecular image dataset to our knowledge. While utilizing a large amount of synthetic data, we employed active learning methods to incorporate substantial in-the-wild data, specifically samples cropped from real patents and scientific literature, into the training process. We trained an end-to-end molecular image captioning model, MolParser, using a curriculum learning approach. MolParser significantly outperforms classical and learning-based methods across most scenarios, with potential for broader downstream applications.

While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g., text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio (Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities. Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings. Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens. These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces, primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.</p></details> |  |

However, such resources are often limited due to privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs) offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on meaningful dermatological descriptions.

However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers, posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data.

To address this gap, we introduce ComicsPAP, a large-scale benchmark designed for comic strip understanding. Comprising over 100k samples and organized into 5 subtasks under a Pick-a-Panel framework, ComicsPAP demands models to identify the missing panel in a sequence. Our evaluations, conducted under both multi-image and single-image protocols, reveal that current state-of-the-art LMMs perform near chance on these tasks, underscoring significant limitations in capturing sequential and contextual dependencies. To close the gap, we adapted LMMs for comic strip understanding, obtaining better results on ComicsPAP than 10x bigger models, demonstrating that ComicsPAP offers a robust resource to drive future research in multimodal comic comprehension.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable limitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information. To address this constraint, researchers have endeavored to integrate visual capabilities with LLMs, resulting in the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These advanced models are instrumental in tackling more intricate tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. In our comprehensive survey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our classification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated to vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to generate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce multimodal inputs and outputs.This classification is based on their respective capabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various modalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive analysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as its strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of its essential components.

In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs, underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Vision-Language Models, Frequency-Domain Perturbations, Adversarial Robustness, Image Authenticity, Reliability</p></details> |

However, CLIP struggles with potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on certain downstream tasks involving short prompts. In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only \emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also \emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification theory.

Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both vision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from large language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems converge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared, embedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a space manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three participants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100 natural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural Scenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not only converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar network of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images. Furthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings outperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the behavioural similarity structure. These findings demonstrate that human visual and linguistic similarity judgements are grounded in a shared, modality-agnostic representational structure that mirrors how the visual system encodes experience. The convergence between sensory and artificial systems suggests a common capacity of how conceptual representations are formed-not as arbitrary products of first order, modality-specific input, but as structured representations that reflect the stable, relational properties of the external world.</p></details> | 51 pages, 15 figures |

While substitution should be a familiar concept from high-school algebra, students often have difficulty applying it to new settings, such as recursive definitions, algebraic data types and higher-order functions. Step-by-step interpreters have been shown to help beginners by clarifying misconceptions and improving understanding. This paper reports on the experience of using a step-by-step tracing interpreter for a subset of Haskell while teaching an introductory functional programming course at the University of Porto. We describe the use of the interpreter, present some feedback obtained from students, reflect on the lessons learned and point directions for further work.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings TFPiE 2025, arXiv:2508.02305</p></details> |

This framework includes a design recipe for regular expressions and a customized error messaging system. The error messaging system produces recipe-based errors that include the step of the design recipe not successfully completed. Furthermore, the error messages follow the established practices of being concise, succinct, jargon-free, and nonprescriptive. In addition, a shorthand syntax developed for writing unit tests is described. The in-class use of the design recipe is illustrated, two debugging sessions using the described system are discussed, and the implementation of the error messaging system is briefly sketched.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings TFPiE 2025, arXiv:2508.02305</p></details> |
| **[A Scalable Machine Learning Pipeline for Building Footprint Detection in Historical Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03564v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6 inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co. Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25 inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the Great Famine period.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Traditionally, this prediction has relied on qualitative, narrative methods. Here we describe a method which uses experimental methods to simulate future technologies, and collect quantitative measures of the attitudes and behaviors of participants assigned to controlled variations of the future. We call this method 'science fiction science'. We suggest that the reason why this method has not been fully embraced yet, despite its potential benefits, is that experimental scientists may be reluctant to engage in work facing such serious validity threats as science fiction science. To address these threats, we consider possible constraints on the kind of technology that science fiction science may study, as well as the unconventional, immersive methods that science fiction science may require. We seek to provide perspective on the reasons why this method has been marginalized for so long, what benefits it would bring if it could be built on strong yet unusual methods, and how we can normalize these methods to help the diverse community of science fiction scientists to engage in a virtuous cycle of validity improvement.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise. To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed, and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community contributions and dataset evolution.</p></details> |  |

Prior work on risk estimation either outputs coarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes indicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses narrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk Index (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks based on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting control commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning within a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) principles, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation, and an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate CRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using a state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our collision-rate metrics show a 19\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions per failed route, a 20\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a 17\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically significant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6 ms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially improves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while maintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.</p></details> | ITSC 2025, 7 pages |

While recent advances in large language models have greatly improved performance, most existing approaches depend on models with tens of billions of parameters or costly APIs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments. For real world, especially on edge devices, it is crucial for Text-to-SQL to ensure cost-effectiveness. Therefore, enabling the light-weight models for Text-to-SQL is of great practical significance. However, smaller LLMs often struggle with complicated user instruction, redundant schema linking or syntax correctness. To address these challenges, we propose MCTS-SQL, a novel framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide SQL generation through multi-step refinement. Since the light-weight models' weak performance of single-shot prediction, we generate better results through several trials with feedback. However, directly applying MCTS-based methods inevitably leads to significant time and computational overhead. Driven by this issue, we propose a token-level prefix-cache mechanism that stores prior information during iterations, effectively improved the execution speed. Experiments results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using a small open-source Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B, our method outperforms ChatGPT-3.5. When leveraging a more powerful model Gemini 2.5 to explore the performance upper bound, we achieved results competitive with the SOTA. Our findings demonstrate that even small models can be effectively deployed in practical Text-to-SQL systems with the right strategy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

However, current learning-based methods often struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency: methods that achieve high accuracy typically demand substantial processing power, while faster approaches tend to sacrifice precision. These fast approaches specifically falter in their generalization capabilities and do not perform well across diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we revisit the limitations of the SOTA methods and present NeuFlow-V2, a novel method that offers both - high accuracy in real-world datasets coupled with low computational overhead. In particular, we introduce a novel light-weight backbone and a fast refinement module to keep computational demands tractable while delivering accurate optical flow. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NeuFlow-V2 provides similar accuracy to SOTA methods while achieving 10x-70x speedups. It is capable of running at over 20 FPS on 512x384 resolution images on a Jetson Orin Nano.

We uncover monosemantic interpretable features by leveraging k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAE). We substantiate our mechanistic interpretations via transfer learning using light-weight classifiers on off-the-shelf diffusion models' features. On $4$ datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of diffusion features for representation learning. We provide an in-depth analysis of how different diffusion architectures, pre-training datasets, and language model conditioning impacts visual representation granularity, inductive biases, and transfer learning capabilities.

| **[Light-Weight Diffusion Multiplier and Uncertainty Quantification for Fourier Neural Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00643v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operator learning is a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential equations, with Fourier Neural Operators serving as a widely adopted foundation. However, FNOs face significant scalability challenges due to overparameterization and offer no native uncertainty quantification -- a key requirement for reliable scientific and engineering applications. Instead, neural operators rely on post hoc UQ methods that ignore geometric inductive biases. In this work, we introduce DINOZAUR: a diffusion-based neural operator parametrization with uncertainty quantification. Inspired by the structure of the heat kernel, DINOZAUR replaces the dense tensor multiplier in FNOs with a dimensionality-independent diffusion multiplier that has a single learnable time parameter per channel, drastically reducing parameter count and memory footprint without compromising predictive performance. By defining priors over those time parameters, we cast DINOZAUR as a Bayesian neural operator to yield spatially correlated outputs and calibrated uncertainty estimates. Our method achieves competitive or superior performance across several PDE benchmarks while providing efficient uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we present an autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) system which purely relies on cost-effective and light-weight passive visual and inertial sensors to perform large-scale autonomous navigation in outdoor,unstructured and cluttered environments. We leverage visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) for accurate MAV state estimates and couple it with a volumetric occupancy submapping system to achieve a scalable mapping framework which can be directly used for path planning. To ensure the safety of the MAV during navigation, we also propose a novel reference trajectory anchoring scheme that deforms the reference trajectory the MAV is tracking upon state updates from the VI-SLAM system in a consistent way, even upon large state updates due to loop-closures. We thoroughly validate our system in both real and simulated forest environments and at peak velocities up to 3 m/s while not encountering a single collision or system failure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system which achieves this level of performance in such an unstructured environment using low-cost passive visual sensors and fully on-board computation, including VI-SLAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Specifically, it takes in 32 input images at a resolution of 960x540 and produces the Gaussian reconstruction in just 1 second on a single A100 GPU. To handle the long sequence of 250K tokens brought by the large input size, Long-LRM features a mixture of the recent Mamba2 blocks and the classical transformer blocks, enhanced by a light-weight token merging module and Gaussian pruning steps that balance between quality and efficiency. We evaluate Long-LRM on the large-scale DL3DV benchmark and Tanks&Temples, demonstrating reconstruction quality comparable to the optimization-based methods while achieving an 800x speedup w.r.t. the optimization-based approaches and an input size at least 60x larger than the previous feed-forward approaches. We conduct extensive ablation studies on our model design choices for both rendering quality and computation efficiency. We also explore Long-LRM's compatibility with other Gaussian variants such as 2D GS, which enhances Long-LRM's ability in geometry reconstruction.

| **[Optimizing against Infeasible Inclusions from Data for Semantic Segmentation through Morphology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14672v6)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art semantic segmentation models are typically optimized in a data-driven fashion, minimizing solely per-pixel or per-segment classification objectives on their training data. This purely data-driven paradigm often leads to absurd segmentations, especially when the domain of input images is shifted from the one encountered during training. For instance, state-of-the-art models may assign the label "road" to a segment that is included by another segment that is respectively labeled as "sky". However, the ground truth of the existing dataset at hand dictates that such inclusion is not feasible. Our method, Infeasible Semantic Inclusions (InSeIn), first extracts explicit inclusion constraints that govern spatial class relations from the semantic segmentation training set at hand in an offline, data-driven fashion, and then enforces a morphological yet differentiable loss that penalizes violations of these constraints during training to promote prediction feasibility. InSeIn is a light-weight plug-and-play method, constitutes a novel step towards minimizing infeasible semantic inclusions in the predictions of learned segmentation models, and yields consistent and significant performance improvements over diverse state-of-the-art networks across the ADE20K, Cityscapes, and ACDC datasets. https://github.com/SHAMIK-97/InSeIn</p></details> |  |

Accurate VAD is essential in automatic speech recognition, voice-to-text, conversational agents, etc, where noise can severely degrade the performance. A modern application includes the voice assistant, specially mounted on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) devices such as cell phones, smart glasses, earbuds, etc, where the voice signal includes background noise. Therefore, VAD modules must remain light-weight due to their practical on-device limitation. The existing models often struggle with low signal-to-noise ratios across diverse acoustic environments. A simple VAD often detects human voice in a clean environment, but struggles to detect the human voice in noisy conditions. We propose a noise-robust VAD that comprises a light-weight VAD, with data pre-processing and post-processing added modules to handle the background noise. This approach significantly enhances the VAD accuracy in noisy environments and requires neither a larger model, nor fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a notable improvement compared to baselines, particularly in environments with high background noise interference. This modified VAD additionally improving clean speech detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Hamed...</summary><p>Hamed Jafarzadeh Asl and Mahsa Ghazvini Nejad contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

To address this, we propose Forward-Backward RAG (FB-RAG), a new training-free framework based on a simple yet powerful forward-looking strategy. FB-RAG employs a light-weight LLM to peek into potential future generations, using evidence from multiple sampled outputs to precisely identify the most relevant context for a final, more powerful generator. This improves performance without complex finetuning or Reinforcement Learning common in prior work. Across 9 datasets, FB-RAG consistently delivers strong results. Further, the performance gains can be achieved with reduced latency due to a shorter, more focused prompt for the powerful generator. On EN.QA dataset, FB-RAG matches the leading baseline with over 48% latency reduction or achieves an 8% performance improvement with a 10% latency reduction. Our analysis finds cases where even when the forward-looking LLM fails to generate correct answers, its attempts are sufficient to guide the final model to an accurate response, demonstrating how smaller LLMs can systematically improve the performance and efficiency of larger ones.</p></details> |  |

Although existing super-resolution-based methods show promising results on public datasets, they often rely on idealized assumptions like accurate region correspondences and reliable dToF inputs, overlooking calibration errors that cause misalignment and anomaly signals inherent to dToF imaging, limiting real-world applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel completion-based method, named DEPTHOR, featuring advances in both the training strategy and model architecture. First, we propose a method to simulate real-world dToF data from the accurate ground truth in synthetic datasets to enable noise-robust training. Second, we design a novel network that incorporates monocular depth estimation (MDE), leveraging global depth relationships and contextual information to improve prediction in challenging regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset, our training strategy significantly enhances depth completion models, achieving results comparable to depth super-resolution methods, while our model achieves state-of-the-art results, improving Rel and RMSE by 27% and 18%, respectively. On a more challenging set of dToF samples we collected, our method outperforms SOTA methods on preliminary stereo-based GT, improving Rel and RMSE by 23% and 22%, respectively.

Conventional RGB-D visual odometry(RGBD-VO) often relies on iterative optimization solvers to estimate pose and involves a process of feature extraction and matching. This results in significant computational burden and time delays. To address this, our innovative method for RGBD-VO separates the estimation of rotation and translation. Initially, we exploit the overlaid planar characteristics within the scene to calculate the rotation matrix. Following this, we utilize a kernel cross-correlator (KCC) to ascertain the translation. By sidestepping the resource-intensive iterative optimization and feature extraction and alignment procedures, our methodology offers improved computational efficacy, achieving a performance of 71Hz on a lower-end i5 CPU. When the RGBD-VO does not rely on feature points, our technique exhibits enhanced performance in low-texture degenerative environments compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, this paradigm faces fundamental challenges: subjective tasks often lack absolute ground truth, and sparse annotation coverage makes aggregation statistically unreliable. We introduce a paradigm shift from sample-wise aggregation to annotator-wise behavior modeling. By treating annotator disagreements as valuable information rather than noise, modeling annotator-specific behavior patterns can reconstruct unlabeled data to reduce annotation cost, enhance aggregation reliability, and explain annotator decision behavior. To this end, we propose QuMATL (Query-based Multi-Annotator Behavior Pattern Learning), which uses light-weight queries to model individual annotators while capturing inter-annotator correlations as implicit regularization, preventing overfitting to sparse individual data while maintaining individualization and improving generalization, with a visualization of annotator focus regions offering an explainable analysis of behavior understanding. We contribute two large-scale datasets with dense per-annotator labels: STREET (4,300 labels/annotator) and AMER (average 3,118 labels/annotator), the first multimodal multi-annotator dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.15237</p></details> |

The paper establishes, for small sources, the existence of solutions on the continuous and discrete level of lowest-order piecewise divergence-free Crouzeix--Raviart finite elements. The vorticity employs a vector version of the pressure space with normal and tangential velocity jump penalisation terms. A simple Raviart--Thomas interpolant leads to pressure-robust a priori error estimates. An explicit residual-based a posteriori error estimate allows for efficient and reliable a posteriori error control. The efficiency for the Forchheimer nonlinearity requires a novel discrete inequality of independent interest. The implementation is based upon a light-weight forest-of-trees data structure handled by a highly parallel set of adaptive mesh refining algorithms. Numerical simulations reveal robustness of the a posteriori error estimates and improved convergence rates by adaptive mesh-refining.</p></details> |  |

However, existing CBMs typically assume static datasets, which fundamentally limits their adaptability to real-world, continuously evolving multimodal data streams. To address this, we define a novel continual learning task for CBMs: simultaneously handling concept-incremental and class-incremental learning. This task requires models to continuously acquire new concepts (often representing cross-modal attributes) and classes while robustly preserving previously learned knowledge. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose CONceptual Continual Incremental Learning (CONCIL), a novel framework that fundamentally re-imagines concept and decision layer updates as linear regression problems. This reformulation eliminates the need for gradient-based optimization, thereby effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, CONCIL relies solely on recursive matrix operations, rendering it highly computationally efficient and well-suited for real-time and large-scale multimodal data applications. Experimental results compellingly demonstrate that CONCIL achieves "absolute knowledge memory" and significantly surpasses the performance of traditional CBM methods in both concept- and class-incremental settings, thus establishing a new paradigm for continual learning in CBMs, particularly valuable for dynamic multimodal understanding.</p></details> |  |

Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study, we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, segmentation models trained on static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work, we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than 144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at http://topics.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Recently, replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this, exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other replay-based methods, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[DuET: Dual Incremental Object Detection via Exemplar-Free Task Arithmetic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21260v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Ambiguity-Guided Learnable Distribution Calibration for Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23237v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes. Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However, these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

Despite their effectiveness, the inherent memory restriction results in saving a limited number of exemplars with poor diversity. In this paper, we introduce PESCR, a novel approach that substantially increases the quantity and enhances the diversity of exemplars based on a pre-trained general-purpose diffusion model, without fine-tuning it on target datasets or storing it in the memory buffer. Images are compressed into visual and textual prompts, which are saved instead of the original images, decreasing memory consumption by a factor of 24. In subsequent phases, diverse exemplars are regenerated by the diffusion model. We further propose partial compression and diffusion-based data augmentation to minimize the domain gap between generated exemplars and real images. PESCR significantly improves CIL performance across multiple benchmarks, e.g., 3.2% above the previous state-of-the-art on ImageNet-100.</p></details> | <details><summary>BMVC ...</summary><p>BMVC 2025.

To meet the complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods across all scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[CLoRA: Parameter-Efficient Continual Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19887v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past, continual learning (CL) was mostly concerned with the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, that arises when incrementally learning a sequence of tasks. Current CL methods function within the confines of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA, we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CoLLAs 2025</p></details> |
| **[External Knowledge Injection for CLIP-Based Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08510v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables learning systems to continuously adapt to evolving data streams. With the advancement of pre-training, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) offers a promising starting point for CIL. However, CLIP makes decisions by matching visual embeddings to class names, overlooking the rich contextual information conveyed through language. For instance, the concept of ``cat'' can be decomposed into features like tail, fur, and face for recognition. Besides, since the model is continually updated, these detailed features are overwritten in CIL, requiring external knowledge for compensation. In this paper, we introduce ExterNal knowledGe INjEction (ENGINE) for CLIP-based CIL. To enhance knowledge transfer from outside the dataset, we propose a dual-branch injection tuning framework that encodes informative knowledge from both visual and textual modalities. The visual branch is enhanced with data augmentation to enrich the visual features, while the textual branch leverages GPT-4 to rewrite discriminative descriptors. In addition to this on-the-fly knowledge injection, we also implement post-tuning knowledge by re-ranking the prediction results during inference. With the injected knowledge, the model can better capture informative features for downstream tasks as data evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ENGINE.

| **[Towards Effective Open-set Graph Class-incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17687v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph class-incremental learning (GCIL) allows graph neural networks (GNNs) to adapt to evolving graph analytical tasks by incrementally learning new class knowledge while retaining knowledge of old classes. Existing GCIL methods primarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed to belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge during inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a more challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two intertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs the detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which destabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems, a novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding generation to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust detection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional variational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old classes, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle unknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node embeddings. A novel prototypical hypersphere classification loss is further proposed, which anchors in-distribution embeddings to their respective class prototypes, while repelling OOD embeddings away. Instead of assigning all unknown samples into one cluster, our proposed objective function explicitly models them as outliers through prototype-aware rejection regions, ensuring a robust open-set recognition. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of OGCIL over existing GCIL and open-set GNN methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Continual Generalized Category Discovery: Learning and Forgetting from a Bayesian Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17382v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) faces a critical challenge: incrementally learning new classes from unlabeled data streams while preserving knowledge of old classes. Existing methods struggle with catastrophic forgetting, especially when unlabeled data mixes known and novel categories. We address this by analyzing C-GCD's forgetting dynamics through a Bayesian lens, revealing that covariance misalignment between old and new classes drives performance degradation. Building on this insight, we propose Variational Bayes C-GCD (VB-CGCD), a novel framework that integrates variational inference with covariance-aware nearest-class-mean classification. VB-CGCD adaptively aligns class distributions while suppressing pseudo-label noise via stochastic variational updates. Experiments show VB-CGCD surpasses prior art by +15.21% with the overall accuracy in the final session on standard benchmarks. We also introduce a new challenging benchmark with only 10% labeled data and extended online phases, VB-CGCD achieves a 67.86% final accuracy, significantly higher than state-of-the-art (38.55%), demonstrating its robust applicability across diverse scenarios.

However, we show that the current SRG analysis suffers from a pitfall that limits its applicability in analyzing practical nonlinear systems. We overcome this pitfall by introducing a novel reformulation of the SRG of a linear time-invariant operator and combining the SRG with the Nyquist criterion. The result is a theorem that can be used to assess stability and $L_2$-gain performance for general interconnections of nonlinear dynamic systems. We provide practical calculation results for canonical interconnections and apply our result to Lur'e systems to obtain a generalization of the celebrated circle criterion, which deals with broader class of nonlinearities, and we derive (incremental) $L_2$-gain performance bounds. We illustrate the power of the new approach on the analysis of several examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vector Quantization Prompting for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20444v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning requires to overcome catastrophic forgetting when training a single model on a sequence of tasks. Recent top-performing approaches are prompt-based methods that utilize a set of learnable parameters (i.e., prompts) to encode task knowledge, from which appropriate ones are selected to guide the fixed pre-trained model in generating features tailored to a certain task. However, existing methods rely on predicting prompt identities for prompt selection, where the identity prediction process cannot be optimized with task loss. This limitation leads to sub-optimal prompt selection and inadequate adaptation of pre-trained features for a specific task. Previous efforts have tried to address this by directly generating prompts from input queries instead of selecting from a set of candidates. However, these prompts are continuous, which lack sufficient abstraction for task knowledge representation, making them less effective for continual learning. To address these challenges, we propose VQ-Prompt, a prompt-based continual learning method that incorporates Vector Quantization (VQ) into end-to-end training of a set of discrete prompts. In this way, VQ-Prompt can optimize the prompt selection process with task loss and meanwhile achieve effective abstraction of task knowledge for continual learning. Extensive experiments show that VQ-Prompt outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods across a variety of benchmarks under the challenging class-incremental setting.

While pool-based prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks, revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding, we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental learning.

| **[Noradrenergic-inspired gain modulation attenuates the stability gap in joint training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14056v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning, revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably, persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps. Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap. Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 1 pseudo-code</p></details> |

The emergence of foundation models (FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization, replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real world medical applications.

We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions. Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>6th C...</summary><p>6th CLVISION ICCV Workshop accepted</p></details> |

The absence of ground truths for unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB) is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions. To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to WACV 2025 (Tucson, Arizona, USA), February 28-March 4 2025</p></details> |

With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models. Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring additional replay data.
