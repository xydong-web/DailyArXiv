| **[BNEM: A Boltzmann Sampler Based on Bootstrapped Noised Energy Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09787v4)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing an efficient sampler capable of generating independent and identically distributed (IID) samples from a Boltzmann distribution is a crucial challenge in scientific research, e.g. molecular dynamics. In this work, we intend to learn neural samplers given energy functions instead of data sampled from the Boltzmann distribution. By learning the energies of the noised data, we propose a diffusion-based sampler, Noised Energy Matching, which theoretically has lower variance and more complexity compared to related works. Furthermore, a novel bootstrapping technique is applied to NEM to balance between bias and variance. We evaluate NEM and BNEM on a 2-dimensional 40 Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a 4-particle double-well potential (DW-4). The experimental results demonstrate that BNEM can achieve state-of-the-art performance while being more robust.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 10 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Assessing the Chemical Intelligence of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07735v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models are versatile, general-purpose tools with a wide range of applications. Recently, the advent of "reasoning models" has led to substantial improvements in their abilities in advanced problem-solving domains such as mathematics and software engineering. In this work, we assessed the ability of reasoning models to directly perform chemistry tasks, without any assistance from external tools. We created a novel benchmark, called ChemIQ, which consists of 796 questions assessing core concepts in organic chemistry, focused on molecular comprehension and chemical reasoning. Unlike previous benchmarks, which primarily use multiple choice formats, our approach requires models to construct short-answer responses, more closely reflecting real-world applications. The reasoning models, exemplified by OpenAI's o3-mini, correctly answered 28%-59% of questions depending on the reasoning level used, with higher reasoning levels significantly increasing performance on all tasks. These models substantially outperformed the non-reasoning model, GPT-4o, which achieved only 7% accuracy. We found that Large Language Models can now convert SMILES strings to IUPAC names, a task earlier models were unable to perform. Additionally, we show that the latest reasoning models can elucidate structures from 1H and 13C NMR data, correctly generating SMILES strings for 74% of molecules containing up to 10 heavy atoms, and in one case solving a structure comprising 21 heavy atoms. For each task, we found evidence that the reasoning process mirrors that of a human chemist. Our results demonstrate that the latest reasoning models have the ability to perform advanced chemical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs Outperform Experts on Challenging Biology Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06108v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study systematically evaluates 27 frontier Large Language Models on eight biology benchmarks spanning molecular biology, genetics, cloning, virology, and biosecurity. Models from major AI developers released between November 2022 and April 2025 were assessed through ten independent runs per benchmark. The findings reveal dramatic improvements in biological capabilities. Top model performance increased more than 4-fold on the challenging text-only subset of the Virology Capabilities Test over the study period, with OpenAI's o3 now performing twice as well as expert virologists. Several models now match or exceed expert-level performance on other challenging benchmarks, including the biology subsets of GPQA and WMDP and LAB-Bench CloningScenarios. Contrary to expectations, chain-of-thought did not substantially improve performance over zero-shot evaluation, while extended reasoning features in o3-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet typically improved performance as predicted by inference scaling. Benchmarks such as PubMedQA and the MMLU and WMDP biology subsets exhibited performance plateaus well below 100%, suggesting benchmark saturation and errors in the underlying benchmark data. The analysis highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation methodologies as AI systems continue to advance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Bayesian non-parametric spatial modeling for cross-sample identification of spatially variable genes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09654v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized tissue analysis by simultaneously mapping gene expression, spatial topography, and histological context across consecutive tissue sections, enabling systematic investigation of spatial heterogeneity. The detection of spatially variable (SV) genes, which are molecular signatures with position-dependent expression, provides critical insights into disease mechanisms spanning oncology, neurology, and cardiovascular research. Current methodologies, however, confront dual constraints: predominant reliance on predefined spatial pattern templates restricts detection of novel complex spatial architectures, and inconsistent sample selection strategies compromise analytical stability and biological interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical framework incorporating non-parametric spatial modeling and across-sample integration. It takes advantage of the non-parametric technique and develops an adaptive spatial process accommodating complex pattern discovery while maintaining biological interpretability. A novel cross-sample bi-level shrinkage prior is further introduced for robust multi-sample SV gene detection, facilitating more effective information fusion. An efficient variational inference is developed for posterior inference ensuring computational scalability. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the improved performance of our proposed method over existing analytical frameworks, and its application to DLPFC data reveals interpretable SV genes whose spatial patterns delineate neuroanatomically relevant clusters and gradients, advancing brain transcriptomics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting solvation free energies with an implicit solvent machine learning potential](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00183v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) potentials are a powerful tool in molecular modeling, enabling ab initio accuracy for comparably small computational costs. Nevertheless, all-atom simulations employing best-performing graph neural network architectures are still too expensive for applications requiring extensive sampling, such as free energy computations. Implicit solvent models could provide the necessary speed-up due to reduced degrees of freedom and faster dynamics. Here, we introduce a Solvation Free Energy Path Reweighting (ReSolv) framework to parametrize an implicit solvent ML potential for small organic molecules that accurately predicts the hydration free energy, an essential parameter in drug design and pollutant modeling. With a combination of top-down (experimental hydration free energy data) and bottom-up (ab initio data of molecules in a vacuum) learning, ReSolv bypasses the need for intractable ab initio data of molecules in explicit bulk solvent and does not have to resort to less accurate data-generating models. On the FreeSolv dataset, ReSolv achieves a mean absolute error close to average experimental uncertainty, significantly outperforming standard explicit solvent force fields. Compared to the explicit solvent ML potential, ReSolv offers a computational speedup of four orders of magnitude and attains closer agreement with experiments. The presented framework paves the way toward deep molecular models that are more accurate yet computationally cheaper than classical atomistic models.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose MetaMolGen, a first-order meta-learning-based molecular generator designed for few-shot and property-conditioned molecular generation. MetaMolGen standardizes the distribution of graph motifs by mapping them to a normalized latent space, and employs a lightweight autoregressive sequence model to generate SMILES sequences that faithfully reflect the underlying molecular structure. In addition, it supports conditional generation of molecules with target properties through a learnable property projector integrated into the generative process.Experimental results demonstrate that MetaMolGen consistently generates valid and diverse SMILES sequences under low-data regimes, outperforming conventional baselines. This highlights its advantage in fast adaptation and efficient conditional generation for practical molecular design.</p></details> |  |

| **[UniMoMo: Unified Generative Modeling of 3D Molecules for De Novo Binder Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19300v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of target-specific molecules such as small molecules, peptides, and antibodies is vital for biological research and drug discovery. Existing generative methods are restricted to single-domain molecules, failing to address versatile therapeutic needs or utilize cross-domain transferability to enhance model performance. In this paper, we introduce Unified generative Modeling of 3D Molecules (UniMoMo), the first framework capable of designing binders of multiple molecular domains using a single model. In particular, UniMoMo unifies the representations of different molecules as graphs of blocks, where each block corresponds to either a standard amino acid or a molecular fragment. Subsequently, UniMoMo utilizes a geometric latent diffusion model for 3D molecular generation, featuring an iterative full-atom autoencoder to compress blocks into latent space points, followed by an E(3)-equivariant diffusion process. Extensive benchmarks across peptides, antibodies, and small molecules demonstrate the superiority of our unified framework over existing domain-specific models, highlighting the benefits of multi-domain training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Modal Molecular Representation Learning via Structure Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05877v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate extraction of molecular representations is a critical step in the drug discovery process. In recent years, significant progress has been made in molecular representation learning methods, among which multi-modal molecular representation methods based on images, and 2D/3D topologies have become increasingly mainstream. However, existing these multi-modal approaches often directly fuse information from different modalities, overlooking the potential of intermodal interactions and failing to adequately capture the complex higher-order relationships and invariant features between molecules. To overcome these challenges, we propose a structure-awareness-based multi-modal self-supervised molecular representation pre-training framework (MMSA) designed to enhance molecular graph representations by leveraging invariant knowledge between molecules. The framework consists of two main modules: the multi-modal molecular representation learning module and the structure-awareness module. The multi-modal molecular representation learning module collaboratively processes information from different modalities of the same molecule to overcome intermodal differences and generate a unified molecular embedding. Subsequently, the structure-awareness module enhances the molecular representation by constructing a hypergraph structure to model higher-order correlations between molecules. This module also introduces a memory mechanism for storing typical molecular representations, aligning them with memory anchors in the memory bank to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the model generalization ability. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of MMSA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MoleculeNet benchmark, with average ROC-AUC improvements ranging from 1.8% to 9.6% over baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Chemical Reaction and Retrosynthesis Prediction with Large Language Model and Dual-task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02639v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical reaction and retrosynthesis prediction are fundamental tasks in drug discovery. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in many domains. However, directly applying LLMs to these tasks faces two major challenges: (i) lacking a large-scale chemical synthesis-related instruction dataset; (ii) ignoring the close correlation between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction for the existing fine-tuning strategies. To address these challenges, we propose ChemDual, a novel LLM framework for accurate chemical synthesis. Specifically, considering the high cost of data acquisition for reaction and retrosynthesis, ChemDual regards the reaction-and-retrosynthesis of molecules as a related recombination-and-fragmentation process and constructs a large-scale of 4.4 million instruction dataset. Furthermore, ChemDual introduces an enhanced LLaMA, equipped with a multi-scale tokenizer and dual-task learning strategy, to jointly optimize the process of recombination and fragmentation as well as the tasks between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction. Extensive experiments on Mol-Instruction and USPTO-50K datasets demonstrate that ChemDual achieves state-of-the-art performance in both predictions of reaction and retrosynthesis, outperforming the existing conventional single-task approaches and the general open-source LLMs. Through molecular docking analysis, ChemDual generates compounds with diverse and strong protein binding affinity, further highlighting its strong potential in drug design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fragment-Masked Molecular Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09106v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, aimed at refining molecular structures to enhance drug efficacy and minimize side effects, ultimately accelerating the overall drug development process. Many target-based molecular optimization methods have been proposed, significantly advancing drug discovery. These methods primarily on understanding the specific drug target structures or their hypothesized roles in combating diseases. However, challenges such as a limited number of available targets and a difficulty capturing clear structures hinder innovative drug development. In contrast, phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) does not depend on clear target structures and can identify hits with novel and unbiased polypharmacology signatures. As a result, PDD-based molecular optimization can reduce potential safety risks while optimizing phenotypic activity, thereby increasing the likelihood of clinical success. Therefore, we propose a fragment-masked molecular optimization method based on PDD (FMOP). FMOP employs a regression-free diffusion model to conditionally optimize the molecular masked regions without training, effectively generating new molecules with similar scaffolds. On the large-scale drug response dataset GDSCv2, we optimize the potential molecules across all 945 cell lines. The overall experiments demonstrate that the in-silico optimization success rate reaches 94.4%, with an average efficacy increase of 5.3%. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation and visualization experiments, confirming that FMOP is an effective and robust molecular optimization method.

| **[Pretraining Generative Flow Networks with Inexpensive Rewards for Molecular Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06337v3)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have recently emerged as a suitable framework for generating diverse and high-quality molecular structures by learning from rewards treated as unnormalized distributions. Previous works in this framework often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on a subset of ZINC dataset, and by employing robust evaluation metrics we show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods for a wide range of drug design tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.09702</p></details> |
| **[GEOM-Drugs Revisited: Toward More Chemically Accurate Benchmarks for 3D Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00169v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models have shown significant promise in generating valid 3D molecular structures, with the GEOM-Drugs dataset serving as a key benchmark. However, current evaluation protocols suffer from critical flaws, including incorrect valency definitions, bugs in bond order calculations, and reliance on force fields inconsistent with the reference data. In this work, we revisit GEOM-Drugs and propose a corrected evaluation framework: we identify and fix issues in data preprocessing, construct chemically accurate valency tables, and introduce a GFN2-xTB-based geometry and energy benchmark. We retrain and re-evaluate several leading models under this framework, providing updated performance metrics and practical recommendations for future benchmarking. Our results underscore the need for chemically rigorous evaluation practices in 3D molecular generation.

Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the "dark chemical space" without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

The graph transformer, with its advantages of high performance and scalability compared to traditional graph networks, has been widely explored in recent research for applications of graph structures. However, current transformer-based graph decoders struggle to effectively utilize graph information, which limits their capacity to leverage only sequences of nodes rather than the complex topological structures of molecule graphs. This paper focuses on building a graph transformer-based framework for molecular generation, which we call \textbf{JTreeformer} as it transforms graph generation into junction tree generation. It combines GCN parallel with multi-head attention as the encoder. It integrates a directed acyclic GCN into a graph-based Transformer to serve as a decoder, which can iteratively synthesize the entire molecule by leveraging information from the partially constructed molecular structure at each step. In addition, a diffusion model is inserted in the latent space generated by the encoder, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of sampling further. The empirical results demonstrate that our novel framework outperforms existing molecule generation methods, thus offering a promising tool to advance drug discovery (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/JTreeformer-C74C).</p></details> | 9 pages, 6figures |

We mitigate this problem with a novel scheme that regulates the aggregation of messages, modulating the type and extent of message passing locally thereby preserving both the low and high-frequency components of information. Our approach relies solely on learnt embeddings, obviating the need for auxiliary labels, thus extending the benefits of heterophily-aware embeddings to broader applications, e.g., generative modelling. Our experiments, conducted across various data sets and GNN architectures, demonstrate performance enhancements and reveal heterophily patterns across standard classification benchmarks. Furthermore, application to molecular generation showcases notable performance improvements on chemoinformatics benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appearing in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improved Molecular Generation through Attribute-Driven Integrative Embeddings and GAN Selectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19040v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for molecules with tailored properties in fields such as drug discovery and chemical engineering has driven advancements in computational methods for molecular design. Machine learning-based approaches for de-novo molecular generation have recently garnered significant attention. This paper introduces a transformer-based vector embedding generator combined with a modified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate molecules with desired properties. The embedding generator utilizes a novel molecular descriptor, integrating Morgan fingerprints with global molecular attributes, enabling the transformer to capture local functional groups and broader molecular characteristics. Modifying the GAN generator loss function ensures the generation of molecules with specific desired properties. The transformer achieves a reconversion accuracy of 94% while translating molecular descriptors back to SMILES strings, validating the utility of the proposed embeddings for generative tasks. The approach is validated by generating novel odorant molecules using a labeled dataset of odorant and non-odorant compounds. With the modified range-loss function, the GAN exclusively generates odorant molecules. This work underscores the potential of combining novel vector embeddings with transformers and modified GAN architectures to accelerate the discovery of tailored molecules, offering a robust tool for diverse molecular design applications.</p></details> |  |

We utilize the geometric products between Clifford multivectors and the rich geometric information encoded in Clifford subspaces in \emph{Clifford Diffusion Models} (CDMs). We extend the diffusion process beyond just Clifford one-vectors to incorporate all higher-grade multivector subspaces. The data is embedded in grade-$k$ subspaces, allowing us to apply latent diffusion across complete multivectors. This enables CDMs to capture the joint distribution across different subspaces of the algebra, incorporating richer geometric information through higher-order features. We provide empirical results for unconditional molecular generation on the QM9 dataset, showing that CDMs provide a promising avenue for generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |

| **[A Comparative Study on Dynamic Graph Embedding based on Mamba and Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11293v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph embedding has emerged as an important technique for modeling complex time-evolving networks across diverse domains. While transformer-based models have shown promise in capturing long-range dependencies in temporal graph data, they face scalability challenges due to quadratic computational complexity. This study presents a comparative analysis of dynamic graph embedding approaches using transformers and the recently proposed Mamba architecture, a state-space model with linear complexity. We introduce three novel models: TransformerG2G augment with graph convolutional networks, \mathcal{DG}-Mamba, and \mathcal{GDG}-Mamba with graph isomorphism network edge convolutions. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Mamba-based models achieve comparable or superior performance to transformer-based approaches in link prediction tasks while offering significant computational efficiency gains on longer sequences. Notably, \mathcal{DG}-Mamba variants consistently outperform transformer-based models on datasets with high temporal variability, such as UCI, Bitcoin, and Reality Mining, while maintaining competitive performance on more stable graphs like SBM. We provide insights into the learned temporal dependencies through analysis of attention weights and state matrices, revealing the models' ability to capture complex temporal patterns. By effectively combining state-space models with graph neural networks, our work addresses key limitations of previous approaches and contributes to the growing body of research on efficient temporal graph representation learning. These findings offer promising directions for scaling dynamic graph embedding to larger, more complex real-world networks, potentially enabling new applications in areas such as social network analysis, financial modeling, and biological system dynamics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

Bardhan et al., Machine learning-enhanced search for a vectorlike singlet B quark decaying to a singlet scalar or pseudoscalar, Phys. Rev. D 107 (2023) 115001; arXiv:2212.02442], we investigate the LHC prospects of pair-produced vectorlike $B$ quarks decaying exotically to a new gauge-singlet (pseudo)scalar field $\Phi$ and a $b$ quark. After the electroweak symmetry breaking, the $\Phi$ decays predominantly to $gg/bb$ final states, leading to a fully hadronic $2b+4j$ or $6b$ signature. Because of the large Standard Model background and the lack of leptonic handles, it is a difficult channel to probe. To overcome the challenge, we employ a hybrid deep learning model containing a graph neural network followed by a deep neural network. We estimate that such a state-of-the-art deep learning analysis pipeline can lead to a performance comparable to that in the semi-leptonic mode, taking the discovery (exclusion) reach up to about $M_B=1.8\:(2.4)$~TeV at HL-LHC when $B$ decays fully exotically, i.e., BR$(B \to b\Phi) = 100\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Existing GNN explanation methods often compute subgraphs (called ``explanatory subgraphs'') that optimize a pre-defined, single explainability measure, such as fidelity or conciseness. This can lead to biased explanations that cannot provide a comprehensive explanation to clarify the output of GNN models. We introduce skyline explanation, a GNN explanation paradigm that aims to identify k explanatory subgraphs by simultaneously optimizing multiple explainability measures. (1) We formulate skyline explanation generation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and pursue explanations that approximate a skyline set of explanatory subgraphs. We show the hardness for skyline explanation generation. (2) We design efficient algorithms with an onion-peeling approach that strategically removes edges from neighbors of nodes of interests, and incrementally improves explanations as it explores an interpretation domain, with provable quality guarantees. (3) We further develop an algorithm to diversify explanations to provide more comprehensive perspectives. Using real-world graphs, we empirically verify the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our algorithms.</p></details> |  |

| **[Self-Supervised Event Representations: Towards Accurate, Real-Time Perception on SoC FPGAs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07556v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based sensors. These include microsecond temporal resolution, robustness under varying lighting conditions and low power consumption. Nevertheless, the effective processing of their sparse, asynchronous event streams remains challenging. Existing approaches to this problem can be categorised into two distinct groups. The first group involves the direct processing of event data with neural models, such as Spiking Neural Networks or Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. However, this approach is often accompanied by a compromise in terms of qualitative performance. The second group involves the conversion of events into dense representations with handcrafted aggregation functions, which can boost accuracy at the cost of temporal fidelity. This paper introduces a novel Self-Supervised Event Representation (SSER) method leveraging Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks to achieve precise per-pixel encoding of event timestamps and polarities without temporal discretisation. The recurrent layers are trained in a self-supervised manner to maximise the fidelity of event-time encoding. The inference is performed with event representations generated asynchronously, thus ensuring compatibility with high-throughput sensors.

| **[Learning Hierarchical Interaction for Accurate Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20127v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering molecules with desirable molecular properties, including ADMET profiles, is of great importance in drug discovery. Existing approaches typically employ deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers, to predict these molecular properties by learning from diverse chemical information. However, these models often fail to efficiently capture and utilize the hierarchical nature of molecular structures, and often lack mechanisms for effective interaction among multi-level features. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Interaction Message Passing Mechanism, which serves as the foundation of our novel model, the Hierarchical Interaction Message Net (HimNet). Our method enables interaction-aware representation learning across atomic, motif, and molecular levels via hierarchical attention-guided message passing. This design allows HimNet to effectively balance global and local information, ensuring rich and task-relevant feature extraction for downstream property prediction tasks, such as Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability (BBBP). We systematically evaluate HimNet on eleven datasets, including eight widely-used MoleculeNet benchmarks and three challenging, high-value datasets for metabolic stability, malaria activity, and liver microsomal clearance, covering a broad range of pharmacologically relevant properties. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HimNet achieves the best or near-best performance in most molecular property prediction tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits promising hierarchical interpretability, aligning well with chemical intuition on representative molecules. We believe that HimNet offers an accurate and efficient solution for molecular activity and ADMET property prediction, contributing to advanced decision-making in the early stages of drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

This limitation typically results in topics that lack coherence and quality. Large Language Models (LLMs) can mitigate this issue by generating an initial set of topics. However, these raw topics frequently lack refinement and representativeness, which leads to redundancy without lexical similarity and reduced interpretability. This paper introduces HAMLET, a graph-driven architecture for cross-lingual healthcare topic modeling that uses LLMs. The proposed approach leverages neural-enhanced semantic fusion to refine the embeddings of topics generated by the LLM. Instead of relying solely on statistical co-occurrence or human interpretation to extract topics from a document corpus, this method introduces a topic embedding refinement that uses Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). After topic generation, a hybrid technique that involves BERT and Sentence-BERT (SBERT) is employed for embedding. The topic representations are further refined using a GNN, which establishes connections between documents, topics, words, similar topics, and similar words. A novel method is introduced to compute similarities. Consequently, the topic embeddings are refined, and the top k topics are extracted. Experiments were conducted using two healthcare datasets, one in English and one in French, from which six sets were derived. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of HAMLET.</p></details> |  |

Concurrently, different explanations methods of GNNs have arisen to complement its black-box nature. Explanations of the GNNs' predictions can be categorized into two types--factual and counterfactual. Given a GNN trained on binary classification into ''accept'' and ''reject'' classes, a global counterfactual explanation consists in generating a small set of ''accept'' graphs relevant to all of the input ''reject'' graphs. The transformation of a ''reject'' graph into an ''accept'' graph is called a recourse. A common recourse explanation is a small set of recourse, from which every ''reject'' graph can be turned into an ''accept'' graph. Although local counterfactual explanations have been studied extensively, the problem of finding common recourse for global counterfactual explanation remains unexplored, particularly for GNNs. In this paper, we formalize the common recourse explanation problem, and design an effective algorithm, COMRECGC, to solve it. We benchmark our algorithm against strong baselines on four different real-world graphs datasets and demonstrate the superior performance of COMRECGC against the competitors. We also compare the common recourse explanations to the graph counterfactual explanation, showing that common recourse explanations are either comparable or superior, making them worth considering for applications such as drug discovery or computational biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[NetSight: Graph Attention Based Traffic Forecasting in Computer Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07034v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traffic in today's networks is increasingly influenced by the interactions among network nodes as well as by the temporal fluctuations in the demands of the nodes. Traditional statistical prediction methods are becoming obsolete due to their inability to address the non-linear and dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies present in today's network traffic. The most promising direction of research today is graph neural networks (GNNs) based prediction approaches that are naturally suited to handle graph-structured data. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art GNN approaches separate the modeling of spatial and temporal information, resulting in the loss of important information about joint dependencies. These GNN based approaches further do not model information at both local and global scales simultaneously, leaving significant room for improvement. To address these challenges, we propose NetSight. NetSight learns joint spatio-temporal dependencies simultaneously at both global and local scales from the time-series of measurements of any given network metric collected at various nodes in a network. Using the learned information, NetSight can then accurately predict the future values of the given network metric at those nodes in the network. We propose several new concepts and techniques in the design of NetSight, such as spatio-temporal adjacency matrix and node normalization. Through extensive evaluations and comparison with prior approaches using data from two large real-world networks, we show that NetSight significantly outperforms all prior state-of-the-art approaches. We will release the source code and data used in the evaluation of NetSight on the acceptance of this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSR-IGRU: Stock Trend Prediction Based on Long Short-Term Relationships and Improved GRU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08282v3)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock price prediction is a challenging problem in the field of finance and receives widespread attention. In recent years, with the rapid development of technologies such as deep learning and graph neural networks, more research methods have begun to focus on exploring the interrelationships between stocks. However, existing methods mostly focus on the short-term dynamic relationships of stocks and directly integrating relationship information with temporal information. They often overlook the complex nonlinear dynamic characteristics and potential higher-order interaction relationships among stocks in the stock market. Therefore, we propose a stock price trend prediction model named LSR-IGRU in this paper, which is based on long short-term stock relationships and an improved GRU input. Firstly, we construct a long short-term relationship matrix between stocks, where secondary industry information is employed for the first time to capture long-term relationships of stocks, and overnight price information is utilized to establish short-term relationships. Next, we improve the inputs of the GRU model at each step, enabling the model to more effectively integrate temporal information and long short-term relationship information, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of predicting stock trend changes. Finally, through extensive experiments on multiple datasets from stock markets in China and the United States, we validate the superiority of the proposed LSR-IGRU model over the current state-of-the-art baseline models. We also apply the proposed model to the algorithmic trading system of a financial company, achieving significantly higher cumulative portfolio returns compared to other baseline methods. Our sources are released at https://github.com/ZP1481616577/Baselines_LSR-IGRU.</p></details> |  |
| **[RobGC: Towards Robust Graph Condensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13200v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted widespread attention for their impressive capability of graph representation learning. However, the increasing prevalence of large-scale graphs presents a significant challenge for GNN training due to their computational demands, limiting the applicability of GNNs in various scenarios. In response to this challenge, graph condensation (GC) is proposed as a promising acceleration solution, focusing on generating an informative compact graph that enables efficient training of GNNs while retaining performance. Despite the potential to accelerate GNN training, existing GC methods overlook the quality of large training graphs during both the training and inference stages. They indiscriminately emulate the training graph distributions, making the condensed graphs susceptible to noises within the training graph and significantly impeding the application of GC in intricate real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose robust graph condensation (RobGC), a plug-and-play approach for GC to extend the robustness and applicability of condensed graphs in noisy graph structure environments. Specifically, RobGC leverages the condensed graph as a feedback signal to guide the denoising process on the original training graph. A label propagation-based alternating optimization strategy is in place for the condensation and denoising processes, contributing to the mutual purification of the condensed graph and training graph. Additionally, as a GC method designed for inductive graph inference, RobGC facilitates test-time graph denoising by leveraging the noise-free condensed graph to calibrate the structure of the test graph. Extensive experiments show that RobGC is compatible with various GC methods, significantly boosting their robustness under different types and levels of graph structural noises.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TKDE 2025</p></details> |

However, it often faces the issue of over-smoothing as the model depth increases, which causes all node representations to converge to a single value and become indistinguishable. This issue stems from the inherent limitations of GNNs, which struggle to distinguish the importance of information from different neighborhoods. In this paper, we introduce MbaGCN, a novel graph convolutional architecture that draws inspiration from the Mamba paradigm-originally designed for sequence modeling. MbaGCN presents a new backbone for GNNs, consisting of three key components: the Message Aggregation Layer, the Selective State Space Transition Layer, and the Node State Prediction Layer. These components work in tandem to adaptively aggregate neighborhood information, providing greater flexibility and scalability for deep GNN models. While MbaGCN may not consistently outperform all existing methods on each dataset, it provides a foundational framework that demonstrates the effective integration of the Mamba paradigm into graph representation learning. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MbaGCN paves the way for future advancements in graph neural network research.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Prior physics-driven approaches leveraged the optimal parameter concentration phenomenon, utilizing medium values of previously optimized QAOA parameters stored in databases as initialization for new graphs. However, this medium-value-based strategy lacks generalization capability. Conversely, prior computer-science-based approaches employed graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on previously optimized QAOA parameters to predict initialization values for new graphs. However, these approaches neglect key physics-informed QAOA principles, such as parameter concentration, symmetry, and adiabatic evolution, resulting in suboptimal parameter predictions and limited performance improvements. Furthermore, no existing GNN-based methods support parameter initialization for QAOA circuits with variable depths or for solving weighted Max-Cut problems. This paper introduces QSeer, a quantum-inspired GNN designed for accurate QAOA parameter prediction. Compared to prior physics- and computer-science-driven methods, QSeer improves the initial approximation ratio and convergence speed of QAOA circuits across diverse graphs by 6%-68% and 5x-10x, respectively.</p></details> |  |

These models refine images from random noise based on textual prompts, with initial reliance on text input shifting towards enhanced visual fidelity over time. This transition suggests that static model parameters might not optimally address the distinct phases of generation. We introduce LGR-AD (Learning Graph Representation of Agent Diffusers), a novel multi-agent system designed to improve adaptability in dynamic computer vision tasks. LGR-AD models the generation process as a distributed system of interacting agents, each representing an expert sub-model. These agents dynamically adapt to varying conditions and collaborate through a graph neural network that encodes their relationships and performance metrics. Our approach employs a coordination mechanism based on top-$k$ maximum spanning trees, optimizing the generation process. Each agent's decision-making is guided by a meta-model that minimizes a novel loss function, balancing accuracy and diversity. Theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations show that LGR-AD outperforms traditional diffusion models across various benchmarks, highlighting its potential for scalable and flexible solutions in complex image generation tasks.

| **[Inference-friendly Graph Compression for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13034v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising performance in graph analysis. Nevertheless, the inference process of GNNs remains costly, hindering their applications for large graphs. This paper proposes inference-friendly graph compression (IFGC), a graph compression scheme to accelerate GNNs inference. Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed graph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that the result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little decompression cost. (1) We characterize IFGC with a class of inference equivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in $G$ that are not distinguishable for GNN inference. (2) We introduce three practical specifications of IFGC for representative GNNs: structural preserving compression (SPGC), which computes $G_c$ that can be directly processed by GNN inference without decompression; ($\alpha$, $r$)-compression, that allows for a configurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and anchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of interest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms with guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse sets of large-scale graphs, which verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our graph compression approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstructing Brain Causal Dynamics for Subject and Task Fingerprints using fMRI Time-series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06392v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Recently, there has been a revived interest in system neuroscience causation models, driven by their unique capability to unravel complex relationships in multi-scale brain networks. In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages causal dynamics to achieve effective fMRI-based subject and task fingerprinting. Methods: By applying an implicit-explicit discretization scheme, we develop a two-timescale linear state-space model. Through data-driven identification of its parameters, the model captures causal signatures, including directed interactions among brain regions from a spatial perspective, and disentangled fast and slow dynamic modes of brain activity from a temporal perspective. These causal signatures are then integrated with: (i) a modal decomposition and projection method for model-based subject identification, and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for learning-based task classification. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the brain reachability landscape as a novel visualization tool, which quantitatively characterizes the maximum possible activation levels of brain regions under various fMRI tasks. Results: We evaluate the proposed approach using the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate its advantage over non-causality-based methods. The obtained causal signatures are visualized and demonstrate clear biological relevance with established understandings of brain function. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing brain causal signatures for subject and task fingerprinting. Additionally, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.</p></details> |  |

While most literature focuses on message passing GNNs (MPNNs), in this work we attend to the more powerful higher-order GNNs. First, we extend the $k$-WL test for graphons (B\"oker, 2023) to the graphon-signal space and introduce signal-weighted homomorphism densities as a key tool. As an exemplary focus, we generalize Invariant Graph Networks (IGNs) to graphons, proposing Invariant Graphon Networks (IWNs) defined via a subset of the IGN basis corresponding to bounded linear operators. Even with this restricted basis, we show that IWNs of order $k$ are at least as powerful as the $k$-WL test, and we establish universal approximation results for graphon-signals in $L^p$ distances. This significantly extends the prior work of Cai & Wang (2022), showing that IWNs--a subset of their IGN-small--retain effectively the same expressivity as the full IGN basis in the limit. In contrast to their approach, our blueprint of IWNs also aligns better with the geometry of graphon space, for example facilitating comparability to MPNNs. We highlight that, while typical higher-order GNNs are discontinuous w.r.t. cut distance--which causes their lack of convergence and is inherently tied to the definition of $k$-WL--transferability remains achievable.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

However, these methods often overlook the critical coupling between visual perception and action prediction. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy}~(\textbf{H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP})$, a novel visuomotor learning framework that explicitly incorporates hierarchical structures to strengthen the integration between visual features and action generation. H$^{3}$DP contains $\mathbf{3}$ levels of hierarchy: (1) depth-aware input layering that organizes RGB-D observations based on depth information; (2) multi-scale visual representations that encode semantic features at varying levels of granularity; and (3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process that aligns the generation of coarse-to-fine actions with corresponding visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H$^{3}$DP yields a $\mathbf{+27.5\%}$ average relative improvement over baselines across $\mathbf{44}$ simulation tasks and achieves superior performance in $\mathbf{4}$ challenging bimanual real-world manipulation tasks.

Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for visual generation face critical limitations: incompatibility with modern Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)-based sampling paradigms, instability in large-scale training, and lack of validation for video generation. This paper introduces DanceGRPO, the first unified framework to adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to visual generation paradigms, unleashing one unified RL algorithm across two generative paradigms (diffusion models and rectified flows), three tasks (text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video), four foundation models (Stable Diffusion, HunyuanVideo, FLUX, SkyReel-I2V), and five reward models (image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary reward). To our knowledge, DanceGRPO is the first RL-based unified framework capable of seamless adaptation across diverse generative paradigms, tasks, foundational models, and reward models. DanceGRPO demonstrates consistent and substantial improvements, which outperform baselines by up to 181% on benchmarks such as HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Notably, DanceGRPO not only can stabilize policy optimization for complex video generation, but also enables generative policy to better capture denoising trajectories for Best-of-N inference scaling and learn from sparse binary feedback. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis. The code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dancegrpo.github.io/</p></details> |

Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates text-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot control. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric representation-can be extracted from videos in a self-supervised manner, enabling diffusion model training on web-scale video-caption data. Treating generated pixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level System 1 module translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action mapping functions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal supervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse temporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal intervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and generalizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings, bridging the gap between language, motion, and action.

This paper presents a comprehensive study of text-to-image synthesis in the medical domain, comparing two distinct approaches: (1) fine-tuning large pre-trained latent diffusion models and (2) training small, domain-specific models. We introduce a novel model named MSDM, an optimized architecture based on Stable Diffusion that integrates a clinical text encoder, variational autoencoder, and cross-attention mechanisms to better align medical text prompts with generated images. Our study compares two approaches: fine-tuning large pre-trained models (FLUX, Kandinsky) versus training compact domain-specific models (MSDM). Evaluation across colonoscopy (MedVQA-GI) and radiology (ROCOv2) datasets reveals that while large models achieve higher fidelity, our optimized MSDM delivers comparable quality with lower computational costs.

When applied to continuous modalities such as visual data, Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) typically resorts to quantization-based approaches to cast the data into a discrete space, which can introduce significant information loss. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Continuous VAR framework that enables direct visual autoregressive generation without vector quantization. The underlying theoretical foundation is strictly proper scoring rules, which provide powerful statistical tools capable of evaluating how well a generative model approximates the true distribution. Within this framework, all we need is to select a strictly proper score and set it as the training objective to optimize. We primarily explore a class of training objectives based on the energy score, which is likelihood-free and thus overcomes the difficulty of making probabilistic predictions in the continuous space. Previous efforts on continuous autoregressive generation, such as GIVT and diffusion loss, can also be derived from our framework using other strictly proper scores.

To this end, we present Step1X-3D, an open framework addressing these challenges through: (1) a rigorous data curation pipeline processing >5M assets to create a 2M high-quality dataset with standardized geometric and textural properties; (2) a two-stage 3D-native architecture combining a hybrid VAE-DiT geometry generator with an diffusion-based texture synthesis module; and (3) the full open-source release of models, training code, and adaptation modules. For geometry generation, the hybrid VAE-DiT component produces TSDF representations by employing perceiver-based latent encoding with sharp edge sampling for detail preservation. The diffusion-based texture synthesis module then ensures cross-view consistency through geometric conditioning and latent-space synchronization. Benchmark results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance that exceeds existing open-source methods, while also achieving competitive quality with proprietary solutions. Notably, the framework uniquely bridges the 2D and 3D generation paradigms by supporting direct transfer of 2D control techniques~(e.g., LoRA) to 3D synthesis. By simultaneously advancing data quality, algorithmic fidelity, and reproducibility, Step1X-3D aims to establish new standards for open research in controllable 3D asset generation.</p></details> | Technical report |

Furthermore, a novel bootstrapping technique is applied to NEM to balance between bias and variance. We evaluate NEM and BNEM on a 2-dimensional 40 Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a 4-particle double-well potential (DW-4).

Current methods, which focus on specific artifacts rather than fundamental inconsistencies, often fail when confronted with novel generative models. To address this limitation, we introduce Layer-aware Mask Modulation Vision Transformer (LAMM-ViT), a Vision Transformer designed for robust facial forgery detection. This model integrates distinct Region-Guided Multi-Head Attention (RG-MHA) and Layer-aware Mask Modulation (LAMM) components within each layer. RG-MHA utilizes facial landmarks to create regional attention masks, guiding the model to scrutinize architectural inconsistencies across different facial areas. Crucially, the separate LAMM module dynamically generates layer-specific parameters, including mask weights and gating values, based on network context. These parameters then modulate the behavior of RG-MHA, enabling adaptive adjustment of regional focus across network depths. This architecture facilitates the capture of subtle, hierarchical forgery cues ubiquitous among diverse generation techniques, such as GANs and Diffusion Models. In cross-model generalization tests, LAMM-ViT demonstrates superior performance, achieving 94.09% mean ACC (a +5.45% improvement over SoTA) and 98.62% mean AP (a +3.09% improvement). These results demonstrate LAMM-ViT's exceptional ability to generalize and its potential for reliable deployment against evolving synthetic media threats.</p></details> |  |

However, it falls short when dealing with glossy surfaces, resulting in visible holes in these areas. We found the reflection discontinuity causes the issue. To fit the jump from diffuse to specular reflection at different viewing angles, depth bias is introduced in the optimized Gaussian primitives. To address that, we first replace the depth distortion loss in 2DGS with a novel depth convergence loss, which imposes a strong constraint on depth continuity. Then, we rectified the depth criterion in determining the actual surface, which fully accounts for all the intersecting Gaussians along the ray. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations across various datasets reveal that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality, with more complete and accurate surfaces than 2DGS.</p></details> | <details><summary>We fo...</summary><p>We found a major error in Sec. 4.3 Novel View Synthesis.

To address this limitation we propose a framework that includes a dataset collection pipeline and architectural extensions to video diffusion models to enable text-to-multi-shot video generation. Our approach enables generation of multi-shot videos as a single video with full attention across all frames of all shots, ensuring character and background consistency, and allows users to control the number, duration, and content of shots through shot-specific conditioning. This is achieved by incorporating a transition token into the text-to-video model to control at which frames a new shot begins and a local attention masking strategy which controls the transition token's effect and allows shot-specific prompting. To obtain training data we propose a novel data collection pipeline to construct a multi-shot video dataset from existing single-shot video datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-video model for a few thousand iterations is enough for the model to subsequently be able to generate multi-shot videos with shot-specific control, outperforming the baselines.

| **[Langevin Diffusion Approximation to Same Marginal Schrödinger Bridge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07647v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel approximation to the same marginal Schr\"{o}dinger bridge using the Langevin diffusion. As $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$, it is known that the barycentric projection (also known as the entropic Brenier map) of the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge converges to the Brenier map, which is the identity. Our diffusion approximation is leveraged to show that, under suitable assumptions, the difference between the two is $\varepsilon$ times the gradient of the marginal log density (i.e., the score function), in $\mathbf{L}^2$. More generally, we show that the family of Markov operators, indexed by $\varepsilon > 0$, derived from integrating test functions against the conditional density of the static Schr\"{o}dinger bridge at temperature $\varepsilon$, admits a derivative at $\varepsilon=0$ given by the generator of the Langevin semigroup. Hence, these operators satisfy an approximate semigroup property at low temperatures.</p></details> | <details><summary>These...</summary><p>These results have been extracted from the first half of arXiv:2406.10823, where they first appeared.

| **['Congratulations, morons': Dynamics of Toxicity and Interaction Polarization in the Covid Vaccination and Ukraine War Twitter Debates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07646v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existence of polarization and echo chambers has been noted in social media discussions of public concern such as the Covid-19 pandemic, foreign election interference, and regional conflicts. However, measuring polarization and assessing the manner in which polarization contributes to partisan behavior is not always possible to evaluate with static network or affect measurements. To address this, we conduct an analysis of two large Twitter datasets collected around Covid-19 vaccination and the Ukraine war to investigate polarization in terms of the evolution in influencer preferences and toxicity of post contents. By reducing retweet behavior in each sample to several key dimensions, we identify clusters that reflect ideological preferences, along with geographic or linguistic separation for some cases. By tracking the central retweet tendency of these clusters over time, we observe differences in the relative position of ideologically unaligned clusters compared to aligned ones, which we interpret as reflecting polarization dynamics in the information diffusion space. We then measure the toxicity of posts and test if toxicity in one cluster can be temporally dependent on its structural closeness to (or toxicity of) another. We find evidence of ideological opposition among clusters of users in both samples, and a temporal association between toxicity and structural divergence for at least two ideologically opposed clusters in our samples. These observations support the importance of analyzing polarization as a multifaceted dynamic phenomenon where polarization dynamics may also manifest in unexpected ways such as within a single ideological camp.</p></details> |  |
| **[SICNav-Diffusion: Safe and Interactive Crowd Navigation with Diffusion Trajectory Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08858v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To navigate crowds without collisions, robots must interact with humans by forecasting their future motion and reacting accordingly. While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> |  |

Recent video editing approaches primarily fall into two categories: training-required and training-free methods. While training-based methods incur high computational costs, training-free alternatives often yield suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose DAPE, a high-quality yet cost-effective two-stage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework for video editing. In the first stage, we design an efficient norm-tuning method to enhance temporal consistency in generated videos. The second stage introduces a vision-friendly adapter to improve visual quality. Additionally, we identify critical shortcomings in existing benchmarks, including limited category diversity, imbalanced object distribution, and inconsistent frame counts. To mitigate these issues, we curate a large dataset benchmark comprising 232 videos with rich annotations and 6 editing prompts, enabling objective and comprehensive evaluation of advanced methods. Extensive experiments on existing datasets (BalanceCC, LOVEU-TGVE, RAVE) and our proposed benchmark demonstrate that DAPE significantly improves temporal coherence and text-video alignment while outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

Consequently, we are witnessing growing interests in integrating additional structural constraints, %leveraging additional structural inputs typically in the form of coarse bounding boxes, to better guide the generation process in such challenging cases. In this work, we take the idea of structural guidance a step further by making the observation that contemporary image generation models can directly provide a plausible \emph{fine-grained} structural initialization. We propose a technique that couples this image-based structural guidance with LLM-based instance-level instructions, yielding output images that adhere to all parts of the text prompt, including object counts, instance-level attributes, and spatial relations between instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://tau-vailab.github.io/InstanceGen/</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose CountDiffusion, a training-free framework aiming at generating images with correct object quantity from textual descriptions. CountDiffusion consists of two stages. In the first stage, an intermediate denoising result is generated by the diffusion model to predict the final synthesized image with one-step denoising, and a counting model is used to count the number of objects in this image. In the second stage, a correction module is used to correct the object quantity by changing the attention map of the object with universal guidance. The proposed CountDiffusion can be plugged into any diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation models without further training. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CountDiffusion, which improves the accurate object quantity generation ability of T2I models by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

While unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are commonly used for indoor farm monitoring, their deployment in greenhouses is often constrained by infrastructure limitations, sensor placement challenges, and operational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we develop a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB-D camera, a 3D LiDAR, and an IMU sensor. The UAV employs a LiDAR-inertial odometry algorithm for precise navigation in GNSS-denied environments and utilizes a 3D multi-object tracking algorithm to estimate the count and weight of cherry tomatoes. We evaluate the system using two dataset: one from a harvesting row and another from a growing row. In the harvesting-row dataset, the proposed system achieves 94.4\% counting accuracy and 87.5\% weight estimation accuracy within a 13.2-meter flight completed in 10.5 seconds. For the growing-row dataset, which consists of occluded unripened fruits, we qualitatively analyze tracking performance and highlight future research directions for improving perception in greenhouse with strong occlusions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of UAVs for efficient robotic yield estimation in commercial greenhouses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 ICRA workshop on field robotics</p></details> |

This might be partially the result of the fact that Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT), a critical training step for MLLMs, has traditionally focused on scaling data volume, but not the compositional complexity of training examples. We propose COMPACT (COMPositional Atomic-to-complex visual Capability Tuning), which generates a training dataset explicitly controlling for the compositional complexity of the training examples. The data from COMPACT allows MLLMs to train on combinations of atomic capabilities to learn complex capabilities more efficiently. Across all benchmarks, COMPACT achieves comparable performance to the LLaVA-665k VIT while using less than 10% of its data budget, and even outperforms it on several, especially those involving complex multi-capability tasks. For example, COMPACT achieves substantial 83.3% improvement on MMStar and 94.0% improvement on MM-Vet compared to the full-scale VIT on particularly complex questions that require four or more atomic capabilities. COMPACT offers a scalable, data-efficient, visual compositional tuning recipe to improve on complex visual-language tasks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Rethinking Visual Layer Selection in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21447v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, typically using CLIP-ViT as their visual encoder due to its strong text-image alignment capabilities. While prior studies suggest that different CLIP-ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, most MLLMs still select visual features based on empirical heuristics rather than systematic analysis. In this work, we propose a Layer-wise Representation Similarity approach to group CLIP-ViT layers with similar behaviors into {shallow, middle, and deep} categories and assess their impact on MLLM performance. Building on this foundation, we revisit the visual layer selection problem in MLLMs at scale, training LLaVA-style models ranging from 1.4B to 7B parameters. Through extensive experiments across 10 datasets and 4 tasks, we find that: (1) deep layers are essential for OCR tasks; (2) shallow and middle layers substantially outperform deep layers on reasoning tasks involving counting, positioning, and object localization; (3) a lightweight fusion of features across shallow, middle, and deep layers consistently outperforms specialized fusion baselines and single-layer selections, achieving gains on 9 out of 10 datasets. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, laying the groundwork for deeper investigations into visual representation learning for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Class-Agnostic Counting: Advancements from Reference-Based to Open-World Text-Guided Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19184v3)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual object counting has recently shifted towards class-agnostic counting (CAC), which addresses the challenge of counting objects across arbitrary categories -- a crucial capability for flexible and generalizable counting systems. Unlike humans, who effortlessly identify and count objects from diverse categories without prior knowledge, most existing counting methods are restricted to enumerating instances of known classes, requiring extensive labeled datasets for training and struggling in open-vocabulary settings. In contrast, CAC aims to count objects belonging to classes never seen during training, operating in a few-shot setting. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive review of CAC methodologies. We propose a taxonomy to categorize CAC approaches into three paradigms based on how target object classes can be specified: reference-based, reference-less, and open-world text-guided. Reference-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance by relying on exemplar-guided mechanisms. Reference-less methods eliminate exemplar dependency by leveraging inherent image patterns. Finally, open-world text-guided methods use vision-language models, enabling object class descriptions via textual prompts, offering a flexible and promising solution. Based on this taxonomy, we provide an overview of the architectures of 29 CAC approaches and report their results on gold-standard benchmarks. We compare their performance and discuss their strengths and limitations. Specifically, we present results on the FSC-147 dataset, setting a leaderboard using gold-standard metrics, and on the CARPK dataset to assess generalization capabilities. Finally, we offer a critical discussion of persistent challenges, such as annotation dependency and generalization, alongside future directions. We believe this survey will be a valuable resource, showcasing CAC advancements and guiding future research.</p></details> |  |

Different from previous works that are limited to singulating them using suction cups or soft grippers, RoTipBot can count multiple layers and then grasp them simultaneously in a single grasp closure. Specifically, we first develop a vision-based tactile sensor named RoTip that can rotate and sense contact information around its tip. Equipped with two RoTip sensors, RoTipBot rolls and feeds multiple layers of thin, flexible objects into the centre between its fingers, enabling effective grasping. Moreover, we design a tactile-based grasping strategy that uses RoTip's sensing ability to ensure both fingers maintain secure contact with the object while accurately counting the number of fed objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the RoTip sensor and the RoTipBot approach. The results show that RoTipBot not only achieves a higher success rate but also grasps and counts multiple layers simultaneously -- capabilities not possible with previous methods. Furthermore, RoTipBot operates up to three times faster than state-of-the-art methods. The success of RoTipBot paves the way for future research in object manipulation using mobilised tactile sensors.

| **[SDVPT: Semantic-Driven Visual Prompt Tuning for Open-World Object Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17395v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-world object counting leverages the robust text-image alignment of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to enable counting of arbitrary categories in images specified by textual queries. However, widely adopted naive fine-tuning strategies concentrate exclusively on text-image consistency for categories contained in training, which leads to limited generalizability for unseen categories. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play Semantic-Driven Visual Prompt Tuning framework (SDVPT) that transfers knowledge from the training set to unseen categories with minimal overhead in parameters and inference time. First, we introduce a two-stage visual prompt learning strategy composed of Category-Specific Prompt Initialization (CSPI) and Topology-Guided Prompt Refinement (TGPR). The CSPI generates category-specific visual prompts, and then TGPR distills latent structural patterns from the VLM's text encoder to refine these prompts. During inference, we dynamically synthesize the visual prompts for unseen categories based on the semantic correlation between unseen and training categories, facilitating robust text-image alignment for unseen categories. Extensive experiments integrating SDVPT with all available open-world object counting models demonstrate its effectiveness and adaptability across three widely used datasets: FSC-147, CARPK, and PUCPR+.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPTURe: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Occluded Object Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15485v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty counting in images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/atinpothiraj/CAPTURe</p></details> |
| **[ProgRoCC: A Progressive Approach to Rough Crowd Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13405v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the number of individuals in a crowd grows, enumeration-based techniques become increasingly infeasible and their estimates increasingly unreliable. We propose instead an estimation-based version of the problem: we label Rough Crowd Counting that delivers better accuracy on the basis of training data that is easier to acquire. Rough crowd counting requires only rough annotations of the number of targets in an image, instead of the more traditional, and far more expensive, per-target annotations. We propose an approach to the rough crowd counting problem based on CLIP, termed ProgRoCC. Specifically, we introduce a progressive estimation learning strategy that determines the object count through a coarse-to-fine approach. This approach delivers answers quickly, outperforms the state-of-the-art in semi- and weakly-supervised crowd counting. In addition, we design a vision-language matching adapter that optimizes key-value pairs by mining effective matches of two modalities to refine the visual features, thereby improving the final performance. Extensive experimental results on three widely adopted crowd counting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | Under review |

Existing approaches often rely on large-scale external reasoning modules or elaborate pipeline designs, hindering practical deployment and interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Logical Anomaly Detection (RLAD), which extends traditional anomaly detection by incorporating logical reasoning. We propose a new framework, LAD-Reasoner, a customized tiny multimodal language model built on Qwen2.5-VL 3B. Our approach leverages a two-stage training paradigm that first employs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for fine-grained visual understanding, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine logical anomaly detection and enforce coherent, human-readable reasoning. Crucially, reward signals are derived from both the detection accuracy and the structural quality of the outputs, obviating the need for building chain of thought (CoT) reasoning data. Experiments on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset show that LAD-Reasoner, though significantly smaller, matches the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B in accuracy and F1 score, and further excels in producing concise and interpretable rationales. This unified design reduces reliance on large models and complex pipelines, while offering transparent and interpretable insights into logical anomaly detection. Code and data will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Limits of Vision Language Models Through the Lens of the Binding Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00238v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has documented striking heterogeneity in the performance of state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), including both multimodal language models and text-to-image models. These models are able to describe and generate a diverse array of complex, naturalistic images, yet they exhibit surprising failures on basic multi-object reasoning tasks -- such as counting, localization, and simple forms of visual analogy -- that humans perform with near perfect accuracy. To better understand this puzzling pattern of successes and failures, we turn to theoretical accounts of the binding problem in cognitive science and neuroscience, a fundamental problem that arises when a shared set of representational resources must be used to represent distinct entities (e.g., to represent multiple objects in an image), necessitating the use of serial processing to avoid interference. We find that many of the puzzling failures of state-of-the-art VLMs can be explained as arising due to the binding problem, and that these failure modes are strikingly similar to the limitations exhibited by rapid, feedforward processing in the human brain.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose an annotation-free approach that enables the seamless integration of new fine-grained categories into existing few/zero-shot counting models. By leveraging latent generative models, we synthesize high-quality, category-specific crowded scenes, providing a rich training source for adapting to new categories without manual labeling. Our approach introduces an attention prediction network that identifies fine-grained category boundaries trained using only synthetic pseudo-annotated data. At inference, these fine-grained attention estimates refine the output of existing few/zero-shot counting networks. To benchmark our method, we further introduce the FGTC dataset, a taxonomy-specific fine-grained object counting dataset for natural images. Our method substantially enhances pre-trained state-of-the-art models on fine-grained taxon counting tasks, while using only synthetic data.

The deployment of a SNN usually requires partitioning the network and mapping these partitions onto the hardware's processing units. However, finding optimal deployment configurations is an NP-hard problem, often addressed through optimization algorithms. While some objectives (e.g., memory utilization and chip count) are static, others (e.g., communication latency and energy efficiency) depend on the network's dynamic behavior, necessitating dynamic-aware optimization. To address this, we model SNN dynamics using an Ising-type pairwise interaction framework, bridging microscopic neuron interactions with macroscopic network behavior. We optimize deployment by exploring the parameter and configuration spaces of the Ising model. We evaluate our approach on two SNNs deployed on the sPyNNaker neuromorphic platform. Initial results suggest that the method underperforms, potentially due to the Ising model's equilibrium assumptions and the architectural complexity of real-world neuromorphic hardware, highlighting limitations in its current formulation. Update: The method proposed is with a equilibrium-dynamics SNN assumption, and the original paper does not mention this. The paper needs to be revisited and reuploaded after further experiments.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capability of object detectors has garnered increasing attention from researchers. Despite this growing interest, there remains a lack of a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and evaluation benchmark with fine-grained annotations tailored to assess the OOD generalization on more intricate tasks like object detection and grounding. To address this gap, we introduce COUNTS, a large-scale OOD dataset with object-level annotations. COUNTS encompasses 14 natural distributional shifts, over 222K samples, and more than 1,196K labeled bounding boxes. Leveraging COUNTS, we introduce two novel benchmarks: O(OD)2 and OODG. O(OD)2 is designed to comprehensively evaluate the OOD generalization capabilities of object detectors by utilizing controlled distribution shifts between training and testing data. OODG, on the other hand, aims to assess the OOD generalization of grounding abilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our findings reveal that, while large models and extensive pre-training data substantially en hance performance in in-distribution (IID) scenarios, significant limitations and opportunities for improvement persist in OOD contexts for both object detectors and MLLMs. In visual grounding tasks, even the advanced GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 only achieve 56.7% and 28.0% accuracy, respectively. We hope COUNTS facilitates advancements in the development and assessment of robust object detectors and MLLMs capable of maintaining high performance under distributional shifts.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that employs Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting, enhancing image-text alignment and facilitating more coherent multi-object image editing. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the self-correction task into three critical dimensions (counting, attributes, and spatial relationships), and further divided into object-level subtasks. We construct a multi-agent editing system featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To resolve the problem of subtask integration, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother that employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtask results, thereby enhancing runtime efficiency while eliminating multi-stage distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[InvNeRF-Seg: Fine-Tuning a Pre-Trained NeRF for 3D Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05751v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been widely adopted for reconstructing high quality 3D point clouds from 2D RGB images. However, the segmentation of these reconstructed 3D scenes is more essential for downstream tasks such as object counting, size estimation, and scene understanding. While segmentation on raw 3D point clouds using deep learning requires labor intensive and time-consuming manual annotation, directly training NeRF on binary masks also fails due to the absence of color and shading cues essential for geometry learning. We propose Invariant NeRF for Segmentation (InvNeRFSeg), a two step, zero change fine tuning strategy for 3D segmentation. We first train a standard NeRF on RGB images and then fine tune it using 2D segmentation masks without altering either the model architecture or loss function. This approach produces higher quality, cleaner segmented point clouds directly from the refined radiance field with minimal computational overhead or complexity. Field density analysis reveals consistent semantic refinement: densities of object regions increase while background densities are suppressed, ensuring clean and interpretable segmentations. We demonstrate InvNeRFSegs superior performance over both SA3D and FruitNeRF on both synthetic fruit and real world soybean datasets. This approach effectively extends 2D segmentation to high quality 3D segmentation.</p></details> |  |

This assumption is reflected in the way researchers collect datasets and train vision models. By contrast, literature in cross-cultural psychology and linguistics has provided evidence that people from different cultural backgrounds observe vastly different concepts even when viewing the same visual stimuli. In this paper, we study how these differences manifest themselves in vision-language datasets and models, using language as a proxy for culture. By comparing textual descriptions generated across 7 languages for the same images, we find significant differences in the semantic content and linguistic expression. When datasets are multilingual as opposed to monolingual, descriptions have higher semantic coverage on average, where coverage is measured using scene graphs, model embeddings, and linguistic taxonomies. For example, multilingual descriptions have on average 29.9% more objects, 24.5% more relations, and 46.0% more attributes than a set of monolingual captions. When prompted to describe images in different languages, popular models (e.g. LLaVA) inherit this bias and describe different parts of the image. Moreover, finetuning models on captions from one language performs best on corresponding test data from that language, while finetuning on multilingual data performs consistently well across all test data compositions. Our work points towards the need to account for and embrace the diversity of human perception in the computer vision community.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Mitigating Image Captioning Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03420v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in vision-language models (VLMs) hinder reliability and real-world applicability, usually stemming from distribution shifts between pretraining data and test samples. Existing solutions, such as retraining or fine-tuning on additional data, demand significant computational resources and labor-intensive data collection, while ensemble-based methods incur additional costs by introducing auxiliary VLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time adaptation framework using reinforcement learning to mitigate hallucinations during inference without retraining or any auxiliary VLMs. By updating only the learnable parameters in the layer normalization of the language model (approximately 0.003% of the model parameters), our method reduces distribution shifts between test samples and pretraining samples. A CLIP-based hallucination evaluation model is proposed to provide dual rewards to VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate a 15.4% and 17.3% reduction in hallucination rates on LLaVA and InstructBLIP, respectively. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a 68.3% improvement in hallucination mitigation, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Leaf Disease Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07019v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leaf disease identification plays a pivotal role in smart agriculture. However, many existing studies still struggle to integrate image and textual modalities to compensate for each other's limitations. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on pretraining with constrained datasets such as ImageNet, which lack domain-specific information. We propose SCOLD (Soft-target COntrastive learning for Leaf Disease identification), a context-aware vision-language foundation model tailored to address these challenges for agricultural tasks. SCOLD is developed using a diverse corpus of plant leaf images and corresponding symptom descriptions, comprising over 186,000 image-caption pairs aligned with 97 unique concepts. Through task-agnostic pretraining, SCOLD leverages contextual soft targets to mitigate overconfidence in contrastive learning by smoothing labels, thereby improving model generalization and robustness on fine-grained classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SCOLD outperforms existing vision-language models such as OpenAI-CLIP-L, BioCLIP, and SigLIP2 across several benchmarks, including zero-shot and few-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and image classification, while maintaining a competitive parameter footprint. Ablation studies further highlight SCOLD's effectiveness in contrast to its counterparts. The proposed approach significantly advances the agricultural vision-language foundation model, offering strong performance with minimal or no supervised fine-tuning. This work lays a solid groundwork for future research on models trained with long-form and simplified contexts, tasks involving class ambiguity, and multi-modal systems for intelligent plant disease diagnostics.

| **[Whitened CLIP as a Likelihood Surrogate of Images and Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06934v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Likelihood approximations for images are not trivial to compute and can be useful in many applications. We examine the use of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to assess the likelihood of images and captions. We introduce \textit{Whitened CLIP}, a novel transformation of the CLIP latent space via an invertible linear operation. This transformation ensures that each feature in the embedding space has zero mean, unit standard deviation, and no correlation with all other features, resulting in an identity covariance matrix. We show that the whitened embeddings statistics can be well approximated as a standard normal distribution, thus, the log-likelihood is estimated simply by the square Euclidean norm in the whitened embedding space. The whitening procedure is completely training-free and performed using a pre-computed whitening matrix, hence, is very fast. We present several preliminary experiments demonstrating the properties and applicability of these likelihood scores to images and captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025.

| **[ArtRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Structured Context for Visual Art Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06020v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding visual art requires reasoning across multiple perspectives -- cultural, historical, and stylistic -- beyond mere object recognition. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on general image captioning, they often fail to capture the nuanced interpretations that fine art demands. We propose ArtRAG, a novel, training-free framework that combines structured knowledge with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multi-perspective artwork explanation. ArtRAG automatically constructs an Art Context Knowledge Graph (ACKG) from domain-specific textual sources, organizing entities such as artists, movements, themes, and historical events into a rich, interpretable graph. At inference time, a multi-granular structured retriever selects semantically and topologically relevant subgraphs to guide generation. This enables MLLMs to produce contextually grounded, culturally informed art descriptions. Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG outperforms several heavily trained baselines. Human evaluations further confirm that ArtRAG generates coherent, insightful, and culturally enriched interpretations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Developmentally Plausible Rewards: Communicative Success as a Learning Signal for Interactive Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05970v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method for training language models in an interactive setting inspired by child language acquisition. In our setting, a speaker attempts to communicate some information to a listener in a single-turn dialogue and receives a reward if communicative success is achieved. Unlike earlier related work using image--caption data for interactive reference games, we operationalize communicative success in a more abstract language-only question--answering setting. First, we present a feasibility study demonstrating that our reward provides an indirect signal about grammaticality. Second, we conduct experiments using reinforcement learning to fine-tune language models. We observe that cognitively plausible constraints on the communication channel lead to interpretable changes in speaker behavior. However, we do not yet see improvements on linguistic evaluations from our training regime. We outline potential modifications to the task design and training configuration that could better position future work to use our methodology to observe the benefits of interaction on language learning in computational cognitive models.</p></details> |  |

Second, the extracted information is represented in a memory consisting of a knowledge graph enhanced by vector embeddings to efficiently manage relational information.

| **[Describe Anything in Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05804v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localized image captioning has made significant progress with models like the Describe Anything Model (DAM), which can generate detailed region-specific descriptions without explicit region-text supervision. However, such capabilities have yet to be widely applied to specialized domains like medical imaging, where diagnostic interpretation relies on subtle regional findings rather than global understanding. To mitigate this gap, we propose MedDAM, the first comprehensive framework leveraging large vision-language models for region-specific captioning in medical images. MedDAM employs medical expert-designed prompts tailored to specific imaging modalities and establishes a robust evaluation benchmark comprising a customized assessment protocol, data pre-processing pipeline, and specialized QA template library. This benchmark evaluates both MedDAM and other adaptable large vision-language models, focusing on clinical factuality through attribute-level verification tasks, thereby circumventing the absence of ground-truth region-caption pairs in medical datasets. Extensive experiments on the VinDr-CXR, LIDC-IDRI, and SkinCon datasets demonstrate MedDAM's superiority over leading peers (including GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, LLaMA-3.2 Vision, Qwen2.5-VL, GPT-4Rol, and OMG-LLaVA) in the task, revealing the importance of region-level semantic alignment in medical image understanding and establishing MedDAM as a promising foundation for clinical vision-language integration.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), which enhances fine-grained understanding through three key innovations. First, we leverage large multimodal models to generate 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for capturing global-level semantic details. Second, a high-quality dataset is constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic differences. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks, including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection, image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks. These results highlight FG-CLIP's effectiveness in capturing fine-grained image details and improving overall model performance.

It employs a comparative approach to analyze these tasks through the lens of trustworthiness, underlining fairness, explainability, and ethics. This study synthesizes findings from recent literature to identify trends, challenges, and state-of-the-art solutions. Results: Several key findings were highlighted. Transparency: Explainability of vision language tasks is important for user trust. Techniques, such as attention maps and gradient-based methods, have successfully addressed this issue. Fairness: Bias mitigation in VQA and visual dialogue systems is essential for ensuring unbiased outcomes across diverse demographic groups. Ethical Implications: Addressing biases in multilingual models and ensuring ethical data handling is critical for the responsible deployment of vision-language systems. Conclusion: This study underscores the importance of integrating fairness, transparency, and ethical considerations in developing vision-language models within a unified framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM2CLIP: Powerful Language Model Unlocks Richer Visual Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04997v4)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP is a foundational multimodal model that aligns image and text features into a shared representation space via contrastive learning on large-scale image-text pairs. Its effectiveness primarily stems from the use of natural language as rich supervision. Motivated by the remarkable advancements in large language models (LLMs), this work explores how LLMs' superior text understanding and extensive open-world knowledge can enhance CLIP's capability, especially for processing longer and more complex image captions. We propose an efficient post-training strategy that integrates LLMs into pretrained CLIP. To address the challenge posed by the autoregressive nature of LLMs, we introduce a caption-to-caption contrastive fine-tuning framework, significantly enhancing the discriminative quality of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms LoRA-based methods, achieving nearly fourfold faster training with superior performance. Furthermore, we validate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models such as CLIP, EVA02, and SigLip2 across various zero-shot multimodal retrieval tasks, cross-lingual retrieval tasks, and multimodal language model pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Word to Sentence: A Large-Scale Multi-Instance Dataset for Open-Set Aerial Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03334v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, language-guided open-world aerial object detection has gained significant attention due to its better alignment with real-world application needs. However, due to limited datasets, most existing language-guided methods primarily focus on vocabulary, which fails to meet the demands of more fine-grained open-world detection. To address this limitation, we propose constructing a large-scale language-guided open-set aerial detection dataset, encompassing three levels of language guidance: from words to phrases, and ultimately to sentences. Centered around an open-source large vision-language model and integrating image-operation-based preprocessing with BERT-based postprocessing, we present the OS-W2S Label Engine, an automatic annotation pipeline capable of handling diverse scene annotations for aerial images. Using this label engine, we expand existing aerial detection datasets with rich textual annotations and construct a novel benchmark dataset, called Multi-instance Open-set Aerial Dataset (MI-OAD), addressing the limitations of current remote sensing grounding data and enabling effective open-set aerial detection. Specifically, MI-OAD contains 163,023 images and 2 million image-caption pairs, approximately 40 times larger than comparable datasets. We also employ state-of-the-art open-set methods from the natural image domain, trained on our proposed dataset, to validate the model's open-set detection capabilities. For instance, when trained on our dataset, Grounding DINO achieves improvements of 29.5 AP_{50} and 33.7 Recall@10 for sentence inputs under zero-shot transfer conditions. Both the dataset and the label engine will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

Prior works have explored ever more complex KD strategies involving different objective functions, teacher-ensembles, and weight inheritance. In this work we explore an alternative, yet simple approach -- active data curation as effective distillation for contrastive multimodal pretraining. Our simple online batch selection method, ACID, outperforms strong KD baselines across various model-, data- and compute-configurations. Further, we find such an active data curation strategy to in fact be complementary to standard KD, and can be effectively combined to train highly performant inference-efficient models. Our simple and scalable pretraining framework, ACED, achieves state-of-the-art results across 27 zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks with upto 11% less inference FLOPs. We further demonstrate that our ACED models yield strong vision-encoders for training generative multimodal models in the LiT-Decoder setting, outperforming larger vision encoders for image-captioning and visual question-answering tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Compositional Image-Text Matching and Retrieval by Grounding Entities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02278v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language pretraining on large datasets of images-text pairs is one of the main building blocks of current Vision-Language Models. While with additional training, these models excel in various downstream tasks, including visual question answering, image captioning, and visual commonsense reasoning. However, a notable weakness of pretrained models like CLIP, is their inability to perform entity grounding and compositional image and text matching~\cite{Jiang2024ComCLIP, yang2023amc, Rajabi2023GroundedVSR, learninglocalizeCVPR24}. In this work we propose a novel learning-free zero-shot augmentation of CLIP embeddings that has favorable compositional properties. We compute separate embeddings of sub-images of object entities and relations that are localized by the state of the art open vocabulary detectors and dynamically adjust the baseline global image embedding. % The final embedding is obtained by computing a weighted combination of the sub-image embeddings. The resulting embedding is then utilized for similarity computation with text embedding, resulting in a average 1.5\% improvement in image-text matching accuracy on the Visual Genome and SVO Probes datasets~\cite{krishna2017visualgenome, svo}. Notably, the enhanced embeddings demonstrate superior retrieval performance, thus achieving significant gains on the Flickr30K and MS-COCO retrieval benchmarks~\cite{flickr30ke, mscoco}, improving the state-of-the-art Recall@1 by 12\% and 0.4\%, respectively.

While prior research has shown that adversarial attacks can transfer from open-source to proprietary black-box models in text-only and vision-only contexts, the extent and effectiveness of such vulnerabilities remain underexplored for VLLMs. We present a comprehensive analysis demonstrating that targeted adversarial examples are highly transferable to widely-used proprietary VLLMs such as GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini. We show that attackers can craft perturbations to induce specific attacker-chosen interpretations of visual information, such as misinterpreting hazardous content as safe, overlooking sensitive or restricted material, or generating detailed incorrect responses aligned with the attacker's intent. Furthermore, we discover that universal perturbations -- modifications applicable to a wide set of images -- can consistently induce these misinterpretations across multiple proprietary VLLMs. Our experimental results on object recognition, visual question answering, and image captioning show that this vulnerability is common across current state-of-the-art models, and underscore an urgent need for robust mitigations to ensure the safe and secure deployment of VLLMs.</p></details> |  |

This often restricts this important assistive tool for widespread use across language and accessibility barriers. This work presents AC-Lite, a computationally efficient model for image captioning in low-resource Assamese language. AC-Lite reduces computational requirements by replacing computation-heavy deep network components with lightweight alternatives. The AC-Lite model is designed through extensive ablation experiments with different image feature extractor networks and language decoders. A combination of ShuffleNetv2x1.5 with GRU based language decoder along with bilinear attention is found to provide the best performance with minimum compute. AC-Lite was observed to achieve an 82.3 CIDEr score on the COCO-AC dataset with 2.45 GFLOPs and 22.87M parameters.</p></details> |  |

However, these models struggle with accurately processing visual data, particularly in tasks requiring precise object recognition and fine visual details. Stringent token limits often result in the omission of critical information, hampering performance. To address these limitations, we introduce \SysName, a novel visual prompting mechanism designed to enhance MLLM performance while preserving essential visual details within token limits. \SysName features three key innovations: a prompt-aware strategy that dynamically highlights relevant image regions, a spatial-preserving orchestration schema that maintains object integrity, and a budget-aware prompting method that balances global context with crucial visual details. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that \SysName consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving up to a $26.9\%$ improvement in accuracy while significantly reducing token consumption.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose the conteXtual referring Map (XeMap) task, which focuses on contextual, fine-grained localization of text-referred regions in large-scale RS scenes. Unlike traditional approaches, XeMap enables precise mapping of mid-scale semantic entities that are often overlooked in image-level or object-level methods. To achieve this, we introduce XeMap-Network, a novel architecture designed to handle the complexities of pixel-level cross-modal contextual referring mapping in RS. The network includes a fusion layer that applies self- and cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the interaction between text and image embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Scale Semantic Alignment (HMSA) module that aligns multiscale visual features with the text semantic vector, enabling precise multimodal matching across large-scale RS imagery. To support XeMap task, we provide a novel, annotated dataset, XeMap-set, specifically tailored for this task, overcoming the lack of XeMap datasets in RS imagery. XeMap-Network is evaluated in a zero-shot setting against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance. This highlights its effectiveness in accurately mapping referring regions and providing valuable insights for interpreting large-scale RS environments.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

In this work, we present the first head-to-head comparison of recent discrete optimization techniques for the problem of prompt inversion. We evaluate Greedy Coordinate Gradients (GCG), PEZ , Random Search, AutoDAN and BLIP2's image captioner across various evaluation metrics related to the quality of inverted prompts and the quality of the images generated by the inverted prompts. We find that focusing on the CLIP similarity between the inverted prompts and the ground truth image acts as a poor proxy for the similarity between ground truth image and the image generated by the inverted prompts. While the discrete optimizers effectively minimize their objectives, simply using responses from a well-trained captioner often leads to generated images that more closely resemble those produced by the original prompts.</p></details> | 11 Pages, 3 Figures |

Existing approaches for bias identification rely on datasets containing labels for the task of interest, something that a non-expert may not have access to, or may not have the necessary resources to collect: this greatly limits the number of tasks where model biases can be identified. In this work, we present Classifier-to-Bias (C2B), the first bias discovery framework that works without access to any labeled data: it only relies on a textual description of the classification task to identify biases in the target classification model. This description is fed to a large language model to generate bias proposals and corresponding captions depicting biases together with task-specific target labels. A retrieval model collects images for those captions, which are then used to assess the accuracy of the model w.r.t. the given biases. C2B is training-free, does not require any annotations, has no constraints on the list of biases, and can be applied to any pre-trained model on any classification task. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show that C2B discovers biases beyond those of the original datasets and outperforms a recent state-of-the-art bias detection baseline that relies on task-specific annotations, being a promising first step toward addressing task-agnostic unsupervised bias detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

In this work, we explore the learning dynamics throughout the CPT process for large language models. We specifically focus on how general and downstream domain performance evolves at each training step, with domain performance measured via validation losses. We have observed that the CPT loss curve fundamentally characterizes the transition from one curve to another hidden curve, and could be described by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and learning rate annealing. We derive a CPT scaling law that combines the two factors, enabling the prediction of loss at any (continual) training steps and across learning rate schedules (LRS) in CPT. Our formulation presents a comprehensive understanding of several critical factors in CPT, including loss potential, peak learning rate, training steps, replay ratio, etc. Moreover, our approach can be adapted to customize training hyper-parameters to different CPT goals such as balancing general and domain-specific performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scaling law holds across various CPT datasets and training hyper-parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML2025 (spotlight)</p></details> |

It consists of dynamically deactivating subsets of the network during training to promote more robust representations. Despite its widespread adoption, dropout probabilities are often selected heuristically, and theoretical explanations of its success remain sparse. Here, we analytically study dropout in two-layer neural networks trained with online stochastic gradient descent. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a set of ordinary differential equations that fully characterize the evolution of the network during training and capture the effects of dropout. We obtain a number of exact results describing the generalization error and the optimal dropout probability at short, intermediate, and long training times. Our analysis shows that dropout reduces detrimental correlations between hidden nodes, mitigates the impact of label noise, and that the optimal dropout probability increases with the level of noise in the data. Our results are validated by extensive numerical simulations.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

However, as new versions of the BBR protocol have emerged, it remains unclear to what extent the high-level behaviors described by these models apply to the newer versions. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the most influential steady-state and fluid models describing BBR's coexistence with loss-based flows over shared bottleneck links. Our experiments, conducted on a new experimental platform (FABRIC), extend previous evaluations to additional network scenarios, enabling comparisons between the two models and include the recently introduced BBRv3. Our findings confirm that the steady-state model accurately captures BBRv1 behavior, especially against single loss-based flows. The fluid model successfully captures several key behaviors of BBRv1 and BBRv2 but shows limitations, in scenarios involving deep buffers, large numbers of flows, or intra-flow fairness. Importantly, we observe clear discrepancies between existing model predictions and BBRv3 behavior, suggesting the need for an updated or entirely new modeling approach for this latest version. We hope these results validate and strengthen the research community's confidence in these models and identify scenarios where they do not apply.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Networking Conference, 2025</p></details> |

PMMH is a pseudo-marginal algorithm which jointly proposes a new trajectory and parameter, and accepts or rejects both at once. PGibbs instead alternates between sampling from the trajectory, using an algorithm known as conditional sequential Monte Carlo (CSMC) and the parameter in a Hastings-within-Gibbs fashion. While particle independent Metropolis Hastings (PIMH), the parameter-free version of PMMH, is known to be statistically worse than CSMC, PGibbs can induce a slow mixing if the parameter and the state trajectory are very correlated. This has made PMMH the method of choice for many practitioners, despite theory and experiments favouring CSMC over PIMH for the parameter-free problem. In this article, we describe a formulation of PGibbs which bypasses the Gibbs step, essentially marginalizing over the trajectory distribution in a fashion similar to PMMH. This is achieved by considering the implementation of a CSMC algortihm for the state-space model integrated over the joint distribution of the current parameter and the parameter proposal. We illustrate the benefits of method on a simple example known to be challenging for PMMH.</p></details> | <details><summary>Feedb...</summary><p>Feedback most welcome. 12 pages, 1 figure.

An Evaluation of Large Language Models on Iterative Example-Based Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06774v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation have been extensively studied, particularly for implementing target functionalities from natural-language descriptions. Alternatively, input-output (I/O) examples provide an accessible, unambiguous, and flexible way to describe functionalities. However, their inherent diversity, opaqueness, and incompleteness impose greater challenges for understanding and implementing the target requirements. Therefore, generating code from I/O examples (i.e., example-based code generation) provides a new perspective, allowing us to additionally evaluate LLMs' capability to infer target functionalities from limited information and to process new-form requirements. However, related research about LLMs in example-based code generation remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive study on example-based code generation using LLMs. We adopt an iterative evaluation framework and formalize the objective of example-based code generation as two sequential sub-objectives: generating code conforming to the given examples and generating code that successfully implements the target functionalities from (iteratively) given examples. We assess six state-of-the-art LLMs using a new benchmark of 172 diverse target functionalities. The results demonstrate that when requirements are described using iterative I/O examples rather than natural language, the LLMs' score decreases by over 60%, and the vast majority (even over 95%) of successfully implemented functionalities are achieved in the first round of the iterations. Furthermore, we also find that combining I/O examples with even imprecise and fragmental natural language descriptions greatly improves LLM performance, and the selection of initial I/O examples can also influence the score, suggesting opportunities for prompt optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISSTA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Routing Attacks in Ethereum PoS: A Systematic Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07713v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the promise of greater decentralization and sustainability, Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The new consensus protocol introduces novel vulnerabilities that warrant further investigation. The goal of this paper is to investigate the security of Ethereum's PoS system from an Internet routing perspective. To this end, this paper makes two contributions: First, we devise a novel framework for inferring the distribution of validators on the Internet without disturbing the real network. Second, we introduce a class of network-level attacks on Ethereum's PoS system that jointly exploit Internet routing vulnerabilities with the protocol's reward and penalty mechanisms. We describe two representative attacks: StakeBleed, where the attacker triggers an inactivity leak, halting block finality and causing financial losses for all validators; and KnockBlock, where the attacker increases her expected MEV gains by preventing targeted blocks from being included in the chain. We find that both attacks are practical and effective. An attacker executing StakeBleed can inflict losses of almost 300 ETH in just 2 hours by hijacking as few as 30 IP prefixes. An attacker implementing KnockBlock could increase their MEV expected gains by 44.5% while hijacking a single prefix for less than 2 minutes. Our paper serves as a call to action for validators to reinforce their Internet routing infrastructure and for the Ethereum P2P protocol to implement stronger mechanisms to conceal validator locations.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |

In this paper, we describe a novel approach to creating a neural-network-based behavior detection model that is interpretable by design. Our model is fully interpretable, meaning that the parameters we extract for our explanations have a clear interpretation, fully capture the model's learned knowledge about the learner behavior of interest, and can be used to create explanations that are both faithful and intelligible. We achieve this by implementing a series of constraints to the model that both simplify its inference process and bring it closer to a human conception of the task at hand. We train the model to detect gaming-the-system behavior, evaluate its performance on this task, and compare its learned patterns to those identified by human experts. Our results show that the model is successfully able to learn patterns indicative of gaming-the-system behavior while providing evidence for fully interpretable explanations. We discuss the implications of our approach and suggest ways to evaluate explainability using a human-grounded approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM) 2025</p></details> |

However, their heavy computation costs and model sizes are usually unacceptable in real-world deployment. Model quantization, an effective weight-lighting technique, has become an indispensable procedure in the whole deployment pipeline. The essence of quantization acceleration is the conversion from continuous floating-point numbers to discrete integer ones, which significantly speeds up the memory I/O and calculation, i.e., addition and multiplication. However, performance degradation also comes with the conversion because of the loss of precision. Therefore, it has become increasingly popular and critical to investigate how to perform the conversion and how to compensate for the information loss. This article surveys the recent five-year progress towards low-bit quantization on DNNs. We discuss and compare the state-of-the-art quantization methods and classify them into 8 main categories and 24 sub-categories according to their core techniques. Furthermore, we shed light on the potential research opportunities in the field of model quantization. A curated list of model quantization is provided at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/Awesome-Model-Quantization.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have systematically collected and reviewed the state-of-the-art quantization methods from the past five years, categorizing them into eight distinct groups.

RINS is a particular form of recursive depth that significantly outperforms +55 other variants, including the recent "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM (Liu et al., 2024) and latent recurrent thinking (Geiping et al., 2025). Unlike prior works, we carry out our comparisons on a compute-matched regime, and demonstrate that for a fixed model size and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. More importantly, with light-weight (linear) adapters (comprising <1% of model parameters) and stochastic dropout, RINS offers a no-regret strategy, meaning that RINS-enabled pretraining improves performance in language modeling even when recursive depth is not applied at inference time. This corresponds to improving performance on a training compute-, parameter-, and inference-matched regime, suggesting its potential as a viable component of LLM pretraining!</p></details> |  |

Still, existing deep learning-based methods often require significant computational costs to generate diverse stylized results. Motivated by this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based framework for arbitrary style transfer RLMiniStyler. This framework leverages a unified reinforcement learning policy to iteratively guide the style transfer process by exploring and exploiting stylization feedback, generating smooth sequences of stylized results while achieving model lightweight. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty-aware multi-task learning strategy that automatically adjusts loss weights to adapt to the content and style balance requirements at different training stages, thereby accelerating model convergence. Through a series of experiments across image various resolutions, we have validated the advantages of RLMiniStyler over other state-of-the-art methods in generating high-quality, diverse artistic image sequences at a lower cost.

In this paper, we introduces MemeBLIP2, a light weight multimodal system that detects harmful memes by combining image and text features effectively. We build on previous studies by adding modules that align image and text representations into a shared space and fuse them for better classification. Using BLIP-2 as the core vision-language model, our system is evaluated on the PrideMM datasets. The results show that MemeBLIP2 can capture subtle cues in both modalities, even in cases with ironic or culturally specific content, thereby improving the detection of harmful material.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 3 figures, manucripts in preparation</p></details> |

We utilize a publicly available dataset containing MRI images categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Our primary objective is to build a light weight deep learning model that can automatically classify brain tumor types with high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we incorporate image preprocessing steps, including normalization, data augmentation, and a cropping technique designed to reduce background noise and emphasize relevant regions. The CNN architecture is optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner, enabling systematic exploration of network parameters. To ensure reliable evaluation, we apply 5-fold cross-validation, where each hyperparameter configuration is evaluated across multiple data splits to mitigate overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.78%, indicating its potential as a diagnostic aid in clinical settings. The proposed method offers a low-complexity yet effective solution for assisting in early brain tumor diagnosis.</p></details> | 6 pages |

A lingo is a dialect's key security component by making attackers unable to "speak" the lingo. A lingo's "talk" changes all the time, becoming a moving target for attackers.

However, no general solution has yet been found against the unpredictable behavior of neural networks and reinforcement learning agents. Nevertheless, the improvements of photo-realistic simulators have paved the way towards extensive testing of complex algorithms in different virtual scenarios, which would be expensive and dangerous to implement in the real world. This paper presents SimPRIVE, a simulation framework for physical robot interaction with virtual environments, which operates as a vehicle-in-the-loop platform, rendering a virtual world while operating the vehicle in the real world. Using SimPRIVE, any physical mobile robot running on ROS 2 can easily be configured to move its digital twin in a virtual world built with the Unreal Engine 5 graphic engine, which can be populated with objects, people, or other vehicles with programmable behavior. SimPRIVE has been designed to accommodate custom or pre-built virtual worlds while being light-weight to contain execution times and allow fast rendering. Its main advantage lies in the possibility of testing complex algorithms on the full software and hardware stack while minimizing the risks and costs of a test campaign. The framework has been validated by testing a reinforcement learning agent trained for obstacle avoidance on an AgileX Scout Mini rover that navigates a virtual office environment where everyday objects and people are placed as obstacles. The physical rover moves with no collision in an indoor limited space, thanks to a LiDAR-based heuristic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |

However, designing effective and efficient segmentation neural architectures is a labor-intensive process that may require numerous trials by human experts. In this paper, we address the challenge of integrating multi-head self-attention into high-resolution representation CNNs efficiently by leveraging architecture search. Manually replacing convolution layers with multi-head self-attention is non-trivial due to the costly overhead in memory to maintain high resolution. By contrast, we develop a multi-target multi-branch supernet method, which not only fully utilizes the advantages of high-resolution features but also finds the proper location for placing the multi-head self-attention module. Our search algorithm is optimized towards multiple objectives (e.g., latency and mIoU) and is capable of finding architectures on the Pareto frontier with an arbitrary number of branches in a single search. We further present a series of models via the Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search (HyCTAS) method that searches for the best hybrid combination of light-weight convolution layers and memory-efficient self-attention layers between branches from different resolutions and fuses them to high resolution for both efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyCTAS outperforms previous methods in both semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation tasks. Code and models are available at https://github.com/MarvinYu1995/HyCTAS.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Knowledge-Baed Systems</p></details> |

Given a horizontal partition of a table, a provenance sketch for a query Q records which fragments contain provenance. Once a provenance sketch has been captured for a query, it can be used to speed-up subsequent queries by skipping data that does not belong to a sketch. The size and, thus, also the effectiveness of a provenance sketch is often quite sensitive to the choice of attribute(s) we are partitioning on. In this work, we develop sample-based estimation techniques for the size of provenance sketches akin to a specialized form of approximate query processing. This technique enables the online selection of provenance sketches by estimating the size of sketches for a set of candidate attributes and then creating the sketch that is estimated to yield the largest benefit. We demonstrate experimentally that our estimation is accurate enough to select optimal or near optimal provenance sketches in most cases which in turn leads to a runtime improvement of up to %60 compared to other strategies for selecting provenance sketches.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lightweight Method for Generating Multi-Tier JIT Compilation Virtual Machine in a Meta-Tracing Compiler Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17460v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta-compiler frameworks, such as RPython and Graal/Truffle, generate high-performance virtual machines (VMs) from interpreter definitions. Although they generate VMs with high-quality just-in-time (JIT) compilers, they still lack an important feature that dedicated VMs (i.e., VMs that are developed for specific languages) have, namely \emph{multi-tier compilation}. Multi-tier compilation uses light-weight compilers at early stages and highly-optimizing compilers at later stages in order to balance between compilation overheads and code quality. We propose a novel approach to enabling multi-tier compilation in the VMs generated by a meta-compiler framework. Instead of extending the JIT compiler backend of the framework, our approach drives an existing (heavyweight) compiler backend in the framework to quickly generate unoptimized native code by merely embedding directives and compile-time operations into interpreter definitions. As a validation of the approach, we developed 2SOM, a Simple Object Machine with a two-tier JIT compiler based on RPython. 2SOM first applies the tier-1 threaded code generator that is generated by our proposed technique, then, to the loops that exceed a threshold, applies the tier-2 tracing JIT compiler that is generated by the original RPython framework. Our performance evaluation that runs a program with a realistic workload showed that 2SOM improved, when compared against an RPython-based VM, warm-up performance by 15\%, with merely a 5\% reduction in peak performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECOOP...</summary><p>ECOOP 2025.

| **[Light Edge Fault Tolerant Graph Spanners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10890v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has recently been significant interest in fault tolerant spanners, which are spanners that still maintain their stretch guarantees after some nodes or edges fail. This work has culminated in an almost complete understanding of the three-way tradeoff between stretch, sparsity, and number of faults tolerated. However, despite some progress in metric settings, there have been no results to date on the tradeoff in general graphs between stretch, lightness, and number of faults tolerated. We initiate the study of light edge fault tolerant (EFT) graph spanners, obtaining the first such results. First, we observe that lightness can be unbounded if we use the traditional definition (normalizing by the MST). We then argue that a natural definition of fault-tolerant lightness is to instead normalize by a min-weight fault tolerant connectivity preserver; essentially, a fault-tolerant version of the MST. However, even with this, we show that it is still not generally possible to construct $f$-EFT spanners whose weight compares reasonably to the weight of a min-weight $f$-EFT connectivity preserver. In light of this lower bound, it is natural to then consider bicriteria notions of lightness, where we compare the weight of an $f$-EFT spanner to a min-weight $(f' > f)$-EFT connectivity preserver. The most interesting question is to determine the minimum value of $f'$ that allows for reasonable lightness upper bounds. Our main result is a precise answer to this question: $f' = 2f$. In particular, we show that the lightness can be untenably large (roughly $n/k$ for a $k$-spanner) if one normalizes by the min-weight $(2f-1)$-EFT connectivity preserver. But if one normalizes by the min-weight $2f$-EFT connectivity preserver, then we show that the lightness is bounded by just $O(f^{1/2})$ times the non-fault tolerant lightness (roughly $n^{1/k}$, for a $(1+\epsilon)(2k-1)$-spanner).</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared at ICALP 2025.

Existing research typically tackles this problem through two main strategies: reducing model parameters and resampling inputs. However, light-weight Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformers often struggle to balance efficiency with high performance due to the requirement of long-range modeling capabilities. Recently, the state-space model, particularly Mamba, has emerged as a promising alternative, offering linear complexity with respect to sequence length. Meanwhile, efficient VQA heavily depends on resampling long sequences to minimize computational costs, yet current resampling methods are often weak in preserving essential semantic information. In this work, we present MVQA, a Mamba-based model designed for efficient VQA along with a novel Unified Semantic and Distortion Sampling (USDS) approach. USDS combines semantic patch sampling from low-resolution videos and distortion patch sampling from original-resolution videos. The former captures semantically dense regions, while the latter retains critical distortion details. To prevent computation increase from dual inputs, we propose a fusion mechanism using pre-defined masks, enabling a unified sampling strategy that captures both semantic and quality information without additional computational burden. Experiments show that the proposed MVQA, equipped with USDS, achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while being $2\times$ as fast and requiring only $1/5$ GPU memory.</p></details> |  |

However, controlling these large models for image restoration usually requires a large number of high-quality images and immense computational resources for training, which is costly and not privacy-friendly. In this paper, we find that the well-trained large T2I model (i.e., Flux) is able to produce a variety of high-quality images aligned with real-world distributions, offering an unlimited supply of training samples to mitigate the above issue. Specifically, we proposed a training data construction pipeline for image restoration, namely FluxGen, which includes unconditional image generation, image selection, and degraded image simulation. A novel light-weighted adapter (FluxIR) with squeeze-and-excitation layers is also carefully designed to control the large Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based T2I model so that reasonable details can be restored. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method enables the Flux model to adapt effectively to real-world image restoration tasks, achieving superior scores and visual quality on both synthetic and real-world degradation datasets - at only about 8.5\% of the training cost compared to current approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Existing AudioLLMs typically combine a pre-trained audio encoder with a pre-trained LLM, which are subsequently finetuned on specific audio tasks. However, the pre-trained audio encoder has constrained capacity to capture features for new tasks and datasets. To address this, we propose to incorporate mixtures of `weak' encoders (MoWE) into the AudioLLM framework. MoWE supplements a base encoder with a pool of relatively light weight encoders, selectively activated based on the audio input to enhance feature extraction without significantly increasing model size. Our empirical results demonstrate that MoWE effectively improves multi-task performance, broadening the applicability of AudioLLMs to more diverse audio tasks.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 |

In this paper, we introduced Med-2D SegNet, a novel and highly efficient segmentation architecture that delivers outstanding accuracy while maintaining a minimal computational footprint. Med-2D SegNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including KVASIR-SEG, PH2, EndoVis, and GLAS, with an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 89.77% across 20 diverse datasets. Central to its success is the compact Med Block, a specialized encoder design that incorporates dimension expansion and parameter reduction, enabling precise feature extraction while keeping model parameters to a low count of just 2.07 million. Med-2D SegNet excels in cross-dataset generalization, particularly in polyp segmentation, where it was trained on KVASIR-SEG and showed strong performance on unseen datasets, demonstrating its robustness in zero-shot learning scenarios, even though we acknowledge that further improvements are possible. With top-tier performance in both binary and multi-class segmentation, Med-2D SegNet redefines the balance between accuracy and efficiency, setting a new benchmark for medical image analysis. This work paves the way for developing accessible, high-performance diagnostic tools suitable for clinical environments and resource-constrained settings, making it a step forward in the democratization of advanced medical technology.</p></details> |  |

An intuitive solution involves adopting consistency models, which serve as an effective acceleration paradigm through consistency distillation. However, simply employing this strategy in human image animation often leads to quality decline, including visual blurring, motion degradation, and facial distortion, particularly in dynamic regions. In this paper, we propose the DanceLCM approach complemented by several enhancements to improve visual quality and motion continuity at low-step regime: (1) segmented consistency distillation with an auxiliary light-weight head to incorporate supervision from real video latents, mitigating cumulative errors resulting from single full-trajectory generation; (2) a motion-focused loss to centre on motion regions, and explicit injection of facial fidelity features to improve face authenticity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DanceLCM achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art video diffusion models with a mere 2-4 inference steps, significantly reducing the inference burden without compromising video quality. The code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address the problem of multi-object orientation control in text-to-image diffusion models. This enables the generation of diverse multi-object scenes with precise orientation control for each object. The key idea is to condition the diffusion model with a set of orientation-aware \textbf{compass} tokens, one for each object, along with text tokens. A light-weight encoder network predicts these compass tokens taking object orientation as the input. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset of procedurally generated scenes, each containing one or two 3D assets on a plain background. However, direct training this framework results in poor orientation control as well as leads to entanglement among objects. To mitigate this, we intervene in the generation process and constrain the cross-attention maps of each compass token to its corresponding object regions. The trained model is able to achieve precise orientation control for a) complex objects not seen during training and b) multi-object scenes with more than two objects, indicating strong generalization capabilities. Further, when combined with personalization methods, our method precisely controls the orientation of the new object in diverse contexts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art orientation control and text alignment, quantified with extensive evaluations and a user study.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Camera Ready.

Current exemplar replay strategies impose $\mathcal{O}(t)$ memory/compute complexities. We propose an autoencoder-based hybrid replay (AHR) strategy that leverages our new hybrid autoencoder (HAE) to function as a compressor to alleviate the requirement for large memory, achieving $\mathcal{O}(0.1 t)$ at the worst case with the computing complexity of $\mathcal{O}(t)$ while accomplishing state-of-the-art performance. The decoder later recovers the exemplar data stored in the latent space, rather than in raw format. Additionally, HAE is designed for both discriminative and generative modeling, enabling classification and replay capabilities, respectively. HAE adopts the charged particle system energy minimization equations and repulsive force algorithm for the incremental embedding and distribution of new class centroids in its latent space. Our results demonstrate that AHR consistently outperforms recent baselines across multiple benchmarks while operating with the same memory/compute budgets. The source code is included in the supplementary material and will be open-sourced upon publication.</p></details> | Accepted ICML 2025 |

While existing EFCIL methods leverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two critical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the embeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks, and the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with new data, thereby hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate classifier training as a reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits previous information encoded in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, across various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Lifelong Whole Slide Image Analysis: Online Vision-Language Adaptation and Past-to-Present Gradient Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01984v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) play a crucial role in accurate cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as they provide tissue details at the cellular level. However, the rapid growth of computational tasks involving WSIs poses significant challenges. Given that WSIs are gigapixels in size, they present difficulties in terms of storage, processing, and model training. Therefore, it is essential to develop lifelong learning approaches for WSI analysis. In scenarios where slides are distributed across multiple institutes, we aim to leverage them to develop a unified online model as a computational tool for cancer diagnosis in clinical and hospital settings. In this study, we introduce ADaFGrad, a method designed to enhance lifelong learning for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis. First, we leverage pathology vision-language foundation models to develop a framework that enables interaction between a slide's regional tissue features and a predefined text-based prototype buffer. Additionally, we propose a gradient-distillation mechanism that mimics the gradient of a logit with respect to the classification-head parameters across past and current iterations in a continual-learning setting. We construct a sequence of six TCGA datasets for training and evaluation. Experimental results show that ADaFGrad outperforms both state-of-the-art WSI-specific and conventional continual-learning methods after only a few training epochs, exceeding them by up to +5.068% in the class-incremental learning scenario while exhibiting the least forgetting (i.e., retaining the most knowledge from previous tasks). Moreover, ADaFGrad surpasses its baseline by as much as +40.084% in accuracy, further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Additive Parameter Updates of Vision Transformers for Few-Shot Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08982v2)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating new class information without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence, often referred to as catastrophic forgetting. Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) addresses this by first training a model on a robust dataset of base classes and then incrementally adapting it in successive sessions using only a few labeled examples per novel class. However, this approach is prone to overfitting on the limited new data, which can compromise overall performance and exacerbate forgetting. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective novel FSCIL framework that leverages a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone augmented with parameter-efficient additive updates. Our approach freezes the pre-trained ViT parameters and selectively injects trainable weights into the self-attention modules via an additive update mechanism. This design updates only a small subset of parameters to accommodate new classes without sacrificing the representations learned during the base session. By fine-tuning a limited number of parameters, our method preserves the generalizable features in the frozen ViT while reducing the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, as most parameters remain fixed, the model avoids overwriting previously learned knowledge when small novel data batches are introduced. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach yields state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline FSCIL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[SacFL: Self-Adaptive Federated Continual Learning for Resource-Constrained End Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00365v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm, wherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data generated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by continuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device models. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling machine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is unsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this context, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution, preserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative updates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor autonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial tasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and task-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining lightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices. Moreover, $\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an autonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new task has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately allows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without additional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and THUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\rm{SacFL}$ in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios. Furthermore, a demo system has been developed to verify its practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TNNLS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Partitioned Memory Storage Inspired Few-Shot Class-Incremental learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20797v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current mainstream deep learning techniques exhibit an over-reliance on extensive training data and a lack of adaptability to the dynamic world, marking a considerable disparity from human intelligence. To bridge this gap, Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) has emerged, focusing on continuous learning of new categories with limited samples without forgetting old knowledge. Existing FSCIL studies typically use a single model to learn knowledge across all sessions, inevitably leading to the stability-plasticity dilemma. Unlike machines, humans store varied knowledge in different cerebral cortices. Inspired by this characteristic, our paper aims to develop a method that learns independent models for each session. It can inherently prevent catastrophic forgetting. During the testing stage, our method integrates Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for model deployment. Our method provides a fresh viewpoint for FSCIL and demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100 and mini-ImageNet datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inclusive Training Separation and Implicit Knowledge Interaction for Balanced Online Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20566v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online class-incremental learning (OCIL) focuses on gradually learning new classes (called plasticity) from a stream of data in a single-pass, while concurrently preserving knowledge of previously learned classes (called stability). The primary challenge in OCIL lies in maintaining a good balance between the knowledge of old and new classes within the continually updated model. Most existing methods rely on explicit knowledge interaction through experience replay, and often employ exclusive training separation to address bias problems. Nevertheless, it still remains a big challenge to achieve a well-balanced learner, as these methods often exhibit either reduced plasticity or limited stability due to difficulties in continually integrating knowledge in the OCIL setting. In this paper, we propose a novel replay-based method, called Balanced Online Incremental Learning (BOIL), which can achieve both high plasticity and stability, thus ensuring more balanced performance in OCIL. Our BOIL method proposes an inclusive training separation strategy using dual classifiers so that knowledge from both old and new classes can effectively be integrated into the model, while introducing implicit approaches for transferring knowledge across the two classifiers. Extensive experimental evaluations over three widely-used OCIL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of BOIL, showing more balanced yet better performance compared to state-of-the-art replay-based OCIL methods.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Dynamic Integration of Task-Specific Adapters for Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14983v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-exemplar class Incremental Learning (NECIL) enables models to continuously acquire new classes without retraining from scratch and storing old task exemplars, addressing privacy and storage issues. However, the absence of data from earlier tasks exacerbates the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in NECIL. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Integration of task-specific Adapters (DIA), which comprises two key components: Task-Specific Adapter Integration (TSAI) and Patch-Level Model Alignment. TSAI boosts compositionality through a patch-level adapter integration strategy, which provides a more flexible compositional solution while maintaining low computation costs. Patch-Level Model Alignment maintains feature consistency and accurate decision boundaries via two specialized mechanisms: Patch-Level Distillation Loss (PDL) and Patch-Level Feature Reconstruction method (PFR). Specifically, the PDL preserves feature-level consistency between successive models by implementing a distillation loss based on the contributions of patch tokens to new class learning. The PFR facilitates accurate classifier alignment by reconstructing old class features from previous tasks that adapt to new task knowledge. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our DIA, revealing significant improvements on benchmark datasets in the NECIL setting, maintaining an optimal balance between computational complexity and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperparameters in Continual Learning: A Reality Check](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09066v4)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) aims to train a model on a sequence of tasks (i.e., a CL scenario) while balancing the trade-off between plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (retaining prior knowledge). The dominantly adopted conventional evaluation protocol for CL algorithms selects the best hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, mini-batch size, regularization strengths, etc.) within a given scenario and then evaluates the algorithms using these hyperparameters in the same scenario. However, this protocol has significant shortcomings: it overestimates the CL capacity of algorithms and relies on unrealistic hyperparameter tuning, which is not feasible for real-world applications. From the fundamental principles of evaluation in machine learning, we argue that the evaluation of CL algorithms should focus on assessing the generalizability of their CL capacity to unseen scenarios. Based on this, we propose the Generalizable Two-phase Evaluation Protocol (GTEP) consisting of hyperparameter tuning and evaluation phases. Both phases share the same scenario configuration (e.g., number of tasks) but are generated from different datasets. Hyperparameters of CL algorithms are tuned in the first phase and applied in the second phase to evaluate the algorithms. We apply this protocol to class-incremental learning, both with and without pretrained models. Across more than 8,000 experiments, our results show that most state-of-the-art algorithms fail to replicate their reported performance, highlighting that their CL capacity has been significantly overestimated in the conventional evaluation protocol. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/csm9493/GTEP.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |
| **[Enhancing Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning through Neural Collapse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18437v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) is a critical capability for real-world applications, enabling learning systems to adapt to new tasks while retaining knowledge from previous ones. Recent advancements in pre-trained models (PTMs) have significantly advanced the field of CIL, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods. However, understanding how features evolve and are distributed across incremental tasks remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to modeling feature evolution in PTM-based CIL through the lens of neural collapse (NC), a striking phenomenon observed in the final phase of training, which leads to a well-separated, equiangular feature space. We explore the connection between NC and CIL effectiveness, showing that aligning feature distributions with the NC geometry enhances the ability to capture the dynamic behavior of continual learning. Based on this insight, we introduce Neural Collapse-inspired Pre-Trained Model-based CIL (NCPTM-CIL), a method that dynamically adjusts the feature space to conform to the elegant NC structure, thereby enhancing the continual learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCPTM-CIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets. Notably, when initialized with ViT-B/16-IN1K, NCPTM-CIL surpasses the runner-up method by 6.73% on VTAB, 1.25% on CIFAR-100, and 2.5% on OmniBenchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noise-Tolerant Coreset-Based Class Incremental Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16763v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications of computer vision require the ability to adapt to novel data distributions after deployment. Adaptation requires algorithms capable of continual learning (CL). Continual learners must be plastic to adapt to novel tasks while minimizing forgetting of previous tasks.However, CL opens up avenues for noise to enter the training pipeline and disrupt the CL. This work focuses on label noise and instance noise in the context of class-incremental learning (CIL), where new classes are added to a classifier over time, and there is no access to external data from past classes. We aim to understand the sensitivity of CL methods that work by replaying items from a memory constructed using the idea of Coresets. We derive a new bound for the robustness of such a method to uncorrelated instance noise under a general additive noise threat model, revealing several insights. Putting the theory into practice, we create two continual learning algorithms to construct noise-tolerant replay buffers. We empirically compare the effectiveness of prior memory-based continual learners and the proposed algorithms under label and uncorrelated instance noise on five diverse datasets. We show that existing memory-based CL are not robust whereas the proposed methods exhibit significant improvements in maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing forgetting in the noisy CIL setting.</p></details> | Work-in-Progress |
| **[Audio-Visual Class-Incremental Learning for Fish Feeding intensity Assessment in Aquaculture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15171v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fish Feeding Intensity Assessment (FFIA) is crucial in industrial aquaculture management. Recent multi-modal approaches have shown promise in improving FFIA robustness and efficiency. However, these methods face significant challenges when adapting to new fish species or environments due to catastrophic forgetting and the lack of suitable datasets. To address these limitations, we first introduce AV-CIL-FFIA, a new dataset comprising 81,932 labelled audio-visual clips capturing feeding intensities across six different fish species in real aquaculture environments. Then, we pioneer audio-visual class incremental learning (CIL) for FFIA and demonstrate through benchmarking on AV-CIL-FFIA that it significantly outperforms single-modality methods. Existing CIL methods rely heavily on historical data. Exemplar-based approaches store raw samples, creating storage challenges, while exemplar-free methods avoid data storage but struggle to distinguish subtle feeding intensity variations across different fish species. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HAIL-FFIA, a novel audio-visual class-incremental learning framework that bridges this gap with a prototype-based approach that achieves exemplar-free efficiency while preserving essential knowledge through compact feature representations. Specifically, HAIL-FFIA employs hierarchical representation learning with a dual-path knowledge preservation mechanism that separates general intensity knowledge from fish-specific characteristics. Additionally, it features a dynamic modality balancing system that adaptively adjusts the importance of audio versus visual information based on feeding behaviour stages. Experimental results show that HAIL-FFIA is superior to SOTA methods on AV-CIL-FFIA, achieving higher accuracy with lower storage needs while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting in incremental fish species learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-parametric Memory Consolidation: Towards Brain-like Deep Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14727v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans and most animals inherently possess a distinctive capacity to continually acquire novel experiences and accumulate worldly knowledge over time. This ability, termed continual learning, is also critical for deep neural networks (DNNs) to adapt to the dynamically evolving world in open environments. However, DNNs notoriously suffer from catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge when trained on sequential tasks. In this work, inspired by the interactive human memory and learning system, we propose a novel biomimetic continual learning framework that integrates semi-parametric memory and the wake-sleep consolidation mechanism. For the first time, our method enables deep neural networks to retain high performance on novel tasks while maintaining prior knowledge in real-world challenging continual learning scenarios, e.g., class-incremental learning on ImageNet. This study demonstrates that emulating biological intelligence provides a promising path to enable deep neural networks with continual learning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Existing GFSCIL approaches typically utilize Prototypical Networks (PNs) for metric-based class representations and fine-tune the model during the incremental learning stage. However, these PN-based methods oversimplify learning via novel query set fine-tuning and fail to integrate Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques due to architectural constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a more rigorous and practical setting for GFSCIL that excludes query sets during the incremental training phase. Building on this foundation, we introduce Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning (MEGA), aimed at effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting for GFSCIL. Specifically, by calculating the incremental second-order gradient during the meta-training stage, we endow the model to learn high-quality priors that enhance incremental learning by aligning its behaviors across both the meta-training and incremental learning stages. Extensive experiments on four mainstream graph datasets demonstrate that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art results and enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in GFSCIL. We believe that our proposed MEGA serves as a model-agnostic GFSCIL paradigm, paving the way for future research.</p></details> | Under Review |

Traditional CIL methods primarily rely on visual features, which limits their effectiveness in complex, multimodal scenarios. In contrast, VLMs show promising potential for enhancing CIL by leveraging pre-trained knowledge and integrating multi-modal semantic cues such as text and vision. However, existing approaches struggle to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while preserving the generalization strengths of VLMs across diverse modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a Feature Calibration Enhanced Parameter Synthesis (FCPS) framework. Specifically, FCPS introduces a dynamic parameter adjustment mechanism that iteratively calibrates the contribution of original visual features to the final class decision, thus preserving the model's intrinsic generalization capability across modalities. Simultaneously, parameter integration enables effective knowledge transfer, maintaining a balance between acquiring new class representations and preserving old knowledge. Experimental results on popular benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR100 and ImageNet100) validate the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Decision Boundary for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10976v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously learn new classes from a limited set of training samples without forgetting knowledge of previously learned classes. Conventional FSCIL methods typically build a robust feature extractor during the base training session with abundant training samples and subsequently freeze this extractor, only fine-tuning the classifier in subsequent incremental phases. However, current strategies primarily focus on preventing catastrophic forgetting, considering only the relationship between novel and base classes, without paying attention to the specific decision spaces of each class. To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play Adaptive Decision Boundary Strategy (ADBS), which is compatible with most FSCIL methods. Specifically, we assign a specific decision boundary to each class and adaptively adjust these boundaries during training to optimally refine the decision spaces for the classes in each session. Furthermore, to amplify the distinctiveness between classes, we employ a novel inter-class constraint loss that optimizes the decision boundaries and prototypes for each class. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, namely CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CUB200, demonstrate that incorporating our ADBS method with existing FSCIL techniques significantly improves performance, achieving overall state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

However, time series class-incremental learning (TSCIL) faces two major challenges: catastrophic forgetting and intra-class variations. Catastrophic forgetting occurs because gradient-based parameter update strategies inevitably erase past knowledge. And unlike images, time series data exhibits subject-specific patterns, also known as intra-class variations, which refer to differences in patterns observed within the same class. While exemplar-based methods fail to cover diverse variation with limited samples, existing exemplar-free methods lack explicit mechanisms to handle intra-class variations. To address these two challenges, we propose TS-ACL, which leverages a gradient-free closed-form solution to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem inherent in gradient-based optimization methods while simultaneously learning global distributions to resolve intra-class variations. Additionally, it provides privacy protection and efficiency. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets covering various sensor modalities and tasks demonstrate that TS-ACL achieves performance close to joint training on four datasets, outperforming existing methods and establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for TSCIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Replay-based methods address this by maintaining a small memory buffer of previous samples, achieving competitive performance. For effective replay under constrained storage, recent approaches leverage distilled data to enhance the informativeness of memory. However, such approaches often involve significant computational overhead due to the use of bi-level optimization. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce Grid-based Patch Sampling (GPS), a lightweight and effective strategy for distilling informative memory samples without relying on a trainable model. GPS generates informative samples by sampling a subset of pixels from the original image, yielding compact low-resolution representations that preserve both semantic content and structural information. During replay, these representations are reassembled to support training and evaluation. Experiments on extensive benchmarks demonstrate that GRS can be seamlessly integrated into existing replay frameworks, leading to 3%-4% improvements in average end accuracy under memory-constrained settings, with limited computational overhead.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Continual learning for rotating machinery fault diagnosis with cross-domain environmental and operational variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10151v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although numerous machine learning models exist to detect issues like rolling bearing strain and deformation, typically caused by improper mounting, overloading, or poor lubrication, these models often struggle to isolate faults from the noise of real-world operational and environmental variability. Conditions such as variable loads, high temperatures, stress, and rotational speeds can mask early signs of failure, making reliable detection challenging. To address these limitations, this work proposes a continual deep learning approach capable of learning across domains that share underlying structure over time. This approach goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics by addressing four second-order challenges: catastrophic forgetting (where new learning overwrites past knowledge), lack of plasticity (where models fail to adapt to new data), forward transfer (using past knowledge to improve future learning), and backward transfer (refining past knowledge with insights from new domains). The method comprises a feature generator and domain-specific classifiers, allowing capacity to grow as new domains emerge with minimal interference, while an experience replay mechanism selectively revisits prior domains to mitigate forgetting. Moreover, nonlinear dependencies across domains are exploited by prioritizing replay from those with the highest prior errors, refining models based on most informative past experiences. Experiments show high average domain accuracy (up to 88.96%), with forgetting measures as low as .0027 across non-stationary class-incremental environments.</p></details> |  |

Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CSS) requires incrementally learning new semantic categories while retaining prior knowledge. Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive training based on stochastic gradient descent, employing complex regularization or exemplar replay. However, stochastic gradient descent-based approaches inevitably update the model's weights for past knowledge, leading to catastrophic forgetting, a problem exacerbated by pixel/point-level granularity. To address these challenges, we propose CFSSeg, a novel exemplar-free approach that leverages a closed-form solution, offering a practical and theoretically grounded solution for continual semantic segmentation tasks. This eliminates the need for iterative gradient-based optimization and storage of past data, requiring only a single pass through new samples per step. It not only enhances computational efficiency but also provides a practical solution for dynamic, privacy-sensitive multimedia environments. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D benchmark datasets such as Pascal VOC2012, S3DIS, and ScanNet demonstrate CFSSeg's superior performance.</p></details> |  |
