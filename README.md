Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for chemicals. By conducting a series of scaling experiments, we identify UniChem as the informative molecular database for pre-training the foundation model. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, as a foundation model, ChemFM exhibits strong data efficiency, requiring significantly fewer labeled training samples to achieve state-of-the-art performance. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this tradeoff, we introduce POEMS: Product Of Experts for Interpretable Multiomics Integration using Sparse Decoding, an unsupervised probabilistic framework that preserves predictive performance while providing interpretability. POEMS provides interpretability without linearizing any part of the network by 1) mapping features to latent factors using sparse connections, which directly translates to biomarker discovery, 2) allowing for cross-omic associations through a shared latent space using product of experts model, and 3) reporting contributions of each omic by a gating network that adaptively computes their influence in the representation learning. Additionally, we present an efficient sparse decoder. In a cancer subtyping case study, POEMS achieves competitive clustering and classification performance while offering our novel set of interpretations, demonstrating that biomarker based insight and predictive accuracy can coexist in multiomics representation learning.</p></details> |  |

Conventional approaches rely heavily on expert interpretation and lack scalability, while retrieval-based machine learning approaches remain constrained by limited reference libraries. Generative models offer a promising alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive architectures that overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that formulates molecular structure elucidation as a conditional generation process, directly inferring 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectra using diffusion models. Its denoising network is parameterized by the Diffusion Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture for geometric modeling, conditioned by SpecFormer, a Transformer-based spectral encoder capturing multi-modal spectral dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSpectra accurately elucidates molecular structures, achieving 40.76% top-1 and 99.49% top-10 accuracy. Its performance benefits substantially from 3D geometric modeling, SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is the first framework that unifies multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.</p></details> |  |

| **[On scalable and efficient training of diffusion samplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19552v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of training diffusion models to sample from unnormalized energy distributions in the absence of data, the so-called diffusion samplers. Although these approaches have shown promise, they struggle to scale in more demanding scenarios where energy evaluations are expensive and the sampling space is high-dimensional. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable and sample-efficient framework that properly harmonizes the powerful classical sampling method and the diffusion sampler. Specifically, we utilize Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) samplers with a novelty-based auxiliary energy as a Searcher to collect off-policy samples, using an auxiliary energy function to compensate for exploring modes the diffusion sampler rarely visits. These off-policy samples are then combined with on-policy data to train the diffusion sampler, thereby expanding its coverage of the energy landscape. Furthermore, we identify primacy bias, i.e., the preference of samplers for early experience during training, as the main cause of mode collapse during training, and introduce a periodic re-initialization trick to resolve this issue. Our method significantly improves sample efficiency on standard benchmarks for diffusion samplers and also excels at higher-dimensional problems and real-world molecular conformer generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow matching for reaction pathway generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10530v4)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elucidating reaction mechanisms hinges on efficiently generating transition states (TSs), products, and complete reaction networks. Recent generative models, such as diffusion models for TS sampling and sequence-based architectures for product generation, offer faster alternatives to quantum-chemistry searches. But diffusion models remain constrained by their stochastic differential equation (SDE) dynamics, which suffer from inefficiency and limited controllability. We show that flow matching, a deterministic ordinary differential (ODE) formulation, can replace SDE-based diffusion for molecular and reaction generation. We introduce MolGEN, a conditional flow-matching framework that learns an optimal transport path to transport Gaussian priors to target chemical distributions. On benchmarks used by TSDiff and OA-ReactDiff, MolGEN surpasses TS geometry accuracy and barrier-height prediction while reducing sampling to sub-second inference. MolGEN also supports open-ended product generation with competitive top-k accuracy and avoids mass/electron-balance violations common to sequence models. In a realistic test on the $\gamma$-ketohydroperoxide decomposition network, MolGEN yields higher fractions of valid and intended TSs with markedly fewer quantum-chemistry evaluations than string-based baselines. These results demonstrate that deterministic flow matching provides a unified, accurate, and computationally efficient foundation for molecular generative modeling, signaling that flow matching is the future for molecular generation across chemistry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updates from the previous version: fixed some typos of energy units.

| **[Discrete Bayesian Sample Inference for Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03015v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating graph-structured data is crucial in applications such as molecular generation, knowledge graphs, and network analysis. However, their discrete, unordered nature makes them difficult for traditional generative models, leading to the rise of discrete diffusion and flow matching models. In this work, we introduce GraphBSI, a novel one-shot graph generative model based on Bayesian Sample Inference (BSI). Instead of evolving samples directly, GraphBSI iteratively refines a belief over graphs in the continuous space of distribution parameters, naturally handling discrete structures. Further, we state BSI as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and derive a noise-controlled family of SDEs that preserves the marginal distributions via an approximation of the score function. Our theoretical analysis further reveals the connection to Bayesian Flow Networks and Diffusion models. Finally, in our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on molecular and synthetic graph generation, outperforming existing one-shot graph generative models on the standard benchmarks Moses and GuacaMol.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAR-VAE: Latent Variable Transformers for Scalable and Controllable Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02769v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development of generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable conditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and provide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE (Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder), a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are: (i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks, our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted binding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning and parameter-efficient finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Prior-Guided Flow Matching for Target-Aware Molecule Design with Learnable Atom Number](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01486v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structure-based drug design (SBDD), aiming to generate 3D molecules with high binding affinity toward target proteins, is a vital approach in novel drug discovery. Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated molecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry. Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Scalable and Cost-Efficient de Novo Template-Based Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19865v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Template-based molecular generation offers a promising avenue for drug design by ensuring generated compounds are synthetically accessible through predefined reaction templates and building blocks. In this work, we tackle three core challenges in template-based GFlowNets: (1) minimizing synthesis cost, (2) scaling to large building block libraries, and (3) effectively utilizing small fragment sets. We propose Recursive Cost Guidance, a backward policy framework that employs auxiliary machine learning models to approximate synthesis cost and viability. This guidance steers generation toward low-cost synthesis pathways, significantly enhancing cost-efficiency, molecular diversity, and quality, especially when paired with an Exploitation Penalty that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To enhance performance in smaller building block libraries, we develop a Dynamic Library mechanism that reuses intermediate high-reward states to construct full synthesis trees. Our approach establishes state-of-the-art results in template-based molecular generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy Loss Functions for Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02087v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively leveraging prior knowledge of a system's physics is crucial for applications of machine learning to scientific domains. Previous approaches mostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level. In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly into the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems like molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions also inherently respect physical symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction and report significant improvements over baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[AI-Guided Molecular Simulations in VR: Exploring Strategies for Imitation Learning in Hyperdimensional Molecular Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07189v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a crucial computational tool for researchers to understand and engineer molecular structure and function in areas such as drug discovery, protein engineering, and material design. Despite their utility, MD simulations are expensive, owing to the high dimensionality of molecular systems. Interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) has recently emerged as a "human-in-the-loop" strategy for efficiently navigating hyper-dimensional molecular systems. By providing an immersive 3D environment that enables visualization and manipulation of real-time molecular simulations running on high-performance computing architectures, iMD-VR enables researchers to reach out and guide molecular conformational dynamics, in order to efficiently explore complex, high-dimensional molecular systems. Moreover, iMD-VR simulations generate rich datasets that capture human experts' spatial insight regarding molecular structure and function. This paper explores the use of researcher-generated iMD-VR datasets to train AI agents via imitation learning (IL). IL enables agents to mimic complex behaviours from expert demonstrations, circumventing the need for explicit programming or intricate reward design. In this article, we review IL across robotics and Multi-agents systems domains which are comparable to iMD-VR, and discuss how iMD-VR recordings could be used to train IL models to interact with MD simulations. We then illustrate the applications of these ideas through a proof-of-principle study where iMD-VR data was used to train a CNN network on a simple molecular manipulation task; namely, threading a small molecule through a nanotube pore. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential challenges of using AI agents to augment human expertise in navigating vast molecular conformational spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>(Firs...</summary><p>(First presented at the First Workshop on "eXtended Reality \& Intelligent Agents" (XRIA24) @ ECAI24, Santiago De Compostela (Spain), 20 October 2024)</p></details> |

In our work, we adopt MIST (Goldman et. al., 2023) as the encoder and MolForge (Ucak et. al., 2023) as the decoder, leveraging additional training data to enhance performance. We also threshold the probabilities of each fingerprint bit to focus on the presence of substructures. This results in a tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1 31% / top-10 40% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra in MassSpecGym (Bushuiev et. al., 2024). We position this as a strong baseline for future research in de novo molecule elucidation from mass spectra.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI4Mat-NeurIPS-2025 Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Generative Modeling Enables Molecular Structure Retrieval from Coulomb Explosion Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00179v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing the structural changes that molecules undergo during chemical reactions in real space and time is a long-standing dream and an essential prerequisite for understanding and ultimately controlling femtochemistry. A key approach to tackle this challenging task is Coulomb explosion imaging, which benefited decisively from recently emerging high-repetition-rate X-ray free-electron laser sources. With this technique, information on the molecular structure is inferred from the momentum distributions of the ions produced by the rapid Coulomb explosion of molecules. Retrieving molecular structures from these distributions poses a highly non-linear inverse problem that remains unsolved for molecules consisting of more than a few atoms. Here, we address this challenge using a diffusion-based Transformer neural network. We show that the network reconstructs unknown molecular geometries from ion-momentum distributions with a mean absolute error below one Bohr radius, which is half the length of a typical chemical bond.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolChord: Structure-Sequence Alignment for Protein-Guided Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27671v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structure-based drug design (SBDD), which maps target proteins to candidate molecular ligands, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Effectively aligning protein structural representations with molecular representations, and ensuring alignment between generated drugs and their pharmacological properties, remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges, we propose MolChord, which integrates two key techniques: (1) to align protein and molecule structures with their textual descriptions and sequential representations (e.g., FASTA for proteins and SMILES for molecules), we leverage NatureLM, an autoregressive model unifying text, small molecules, and proteins, as the molecule generator, alongside a diffusion-based structure encoder; and (2) to guide molecules toward desired properties, we curate a property-aware dataset by integrating preference data and refine the alignment process using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on CrossDocked2020 demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on key evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential as a practical tool for SBDD.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Graph Diffusion that can Insert and Delete](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15725v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models of graphs based on discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) offer a principled approach to molecular generation by systematically removing structural noise through iterative atom and bond adjustments. However, existing formulations are fundamentally limited by their inability to adapt the graph size (that is, the number of atoms) during the diffusion process, severely restricting their effectiveness in conditional generation scenarios such as property-driven molecular design, where the targeted property often correlates with the molecular size. In this paper, we reformulate the noising and denoising processes to support monotonic insertion and deletion of nodes. The resulting model, which we call GrIDDD, dynamically grows or shrinks the chemical graph during generation. GrIDDD matches or exceeds the performance of existing graph diffusion models on molecular property targeting despite being trained on a more difficult problem. Furthermore, when applied to molecular optimization, GrIDDD exhibits competitive performance compared to specialized optimization models. This work paves the way for size-adaptive molecular generation with graph diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025).

| **[Graph Sampling for Scalable and Expressive Graph Neural Networks on Homophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16593v5)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in many graph machine learning tasks but face challenges when scaling to large networks. GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian trace -- a proxy for the graph connectivity -- than random sampling, while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving Laplacian trace and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[SHIELD: Securing Healthcare IoT with Efficient Machine Learning Techniques for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03661v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of IoT devices in healthcare introduces significant security and reliability challenges, increasing susceptibility to cyber threats and operational anomalies. This study proposes a machine learning-driven framework for (1) detecting malicious cyberattacks and (2) identifying faulty device anomalies, leveraging a dataset of 200,000 records. Eight machine learning models are evaluated across three learning approaches: supervised learning (XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (K- NN)), semi-supervised learning (Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)), and unsupervised learning (One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), Isolation Forest, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoders). The comprehensive evaluation was conducted across multiple metrics like F1-score, precision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC, computational efficiency. XGBoost achieved 99\% accuracy with minimal computational overhead (0.04s) for anomaly detection, while Isolation Forest balanced precision and recall effectively. LSTM Autoencoders underperformed with lower accuracy and higher latency. For attack detection, KNN achieved near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-score with the lowest computational cost (0.05s), followed by VAE at 97% accuracy. GAN showed the highest computational cost with lowest accuracy and ROC-AUC. These findings enhance IoT-enabled healthcare security through effective anomaly detection strategies. By improving early detection of cyber threats and device failures, this framework has the potential to prevent data breaches, minimize system downtime, and ensure the continuous and safe operation of medical devices, ultimately safeguarding patient health and trust in IoT-driven healthcare solutions.</p></details> |  |

Significant strides have been made in leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to achieve remarkable success in these areas. However, in real-world scenarios, the training environment for models is often far from ideal, leading to substantial performance degradation of GNN models due to various unfavorable factors, including imbalance in data distribution, the presence of noise in erroneous data, privacy protection of sensitive information, and generalization capability for out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To tackle these issues, substantial efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of GNN models in practical real-world scenarios, as well as enhancing their reliability and robustness. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey that systematically reviews existing GNN models, focusing on solutions to the four mentioned real-world challenges including imbalance, noise, privacy, and OOD in practical scenarios that many existing reviews have not considered. Specifically, we first highlight the four key challenges faced by existing GNNs, paving the way for our exploration of real-world GNN models. Subsequently, we provide detailed discussions on these four aspects, dissecting how these solutions contribute to enhancing the reliability and robustness of GNN models. Last but not least, we outline promising directions and offer future perspectives in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI 2025)</p></details> |

Data curation is a time-consuming process for a large volume of data, making it challenging and expensive to deploy data analytics platforms in new environments. Transfer learning (TL) mechanisms promise to mitigate data sparsity and model complexity by utilizing pre-trained models for a new task. Despite the triumph of TL in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, efforts on complex ST models for anomaly detection (AD) applications are limited. In this study, we present the potential of TL within the context of high-dimensional ST AD with a hybrid autoencoder architecture, incorporating convolutional, graph, and recurrent neural networks. Motivated by the need for improved model accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with limited training data on systems with thousands of sensors, this research investigates the transferability of models trained on different sections of the Hadron Calorimeter of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at CERN. The key contributions of the study include exploring TL's potential and limitations within the context of encoder and decoder networks, revealing insights into model initialization and training configurations that enhance performance while substantially reducing trainable parameters and mitigating data contamination effects.

| **[Learning noisy tissue dynamics across time scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19090v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tissue dynamics play a crucial role in biological processes ranging from inflammation to morphogenesis. However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are notoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks, normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph. Cell interactions are encoded in a dual signaling graph capable of handling signaling cascades. The dual graph architecture of our neural networks reflects the architecture of the underlying biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed for training, compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graph Neural AI with Temporal Dynamics for Comprehensive Anomaly Detection in Microservices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03285v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the problem of anomaly detection and root cause tracing in microservice architectures and proposes a unified framework that combines graph neural networks with temporal modeling. The microservice call chain is abstracted as a directed graph, where multidimensional features of nodes and edges are used to construct a service topology representation, and graph convolution is applied to aggregate features across nodes and model dependencies, capturing complex structural relationships among services. On this basis, gated recurrent units are introduced to model the temporal evolution of call chains, and multi-layer stacking and concatenation operations are used to jointly obtain structural and temporal representations, improving the ability to identify anomaly patterns. Furthermore, anomaly scoring functions at both the node and path levels are defined to achieve unified modeling from local anomaly detection to global call chain tracing, which enables the identification of abnormal service nodes and the reconstruction of potential anomaly propagation paths. Sensitivity experiments are then designed from multiple dimensions, including hyperparameters, environmental disturbances, and data distribution, to evaluate the framework, and results show that it outperforms baseline methods in key metrics such as AUC, ACC, Recall, and F1-Score, maintaining high accuracy and stability under dynamic topologies and complex environments. This research not only provides a new technical path for anomaly detection in microservices but also lays a methodological foundation for intelligent operations in distributed systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GMoPE:A Prompt-Expert Mixture Framework for Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03251v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on task-specific benchmarks, yet their ability to generalize across diverse domains and tasks remains limited. Existing approaches often struggle with negative transfer, scalability issues, and high adaptation costs. To address these challenges, we propose GMoPE (Graph Mixture of Prompt-Experts), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with prompt-based learning for graphs. GMoPE leverages expert-specific prompt vectors and structure-aware MoE routing to enable each expert to specialize in distinct subdomains and dynamically contribute to predictions. To promote diversity and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a soft orthogonality constraint across prompt vectors, encouraging expert specialization and facilitating a more balanced expert utilization. Additionally, we adopt a prompt-only fine-tuning strategy that significantly reduces spatiotemporal complexity during transfer. We validate GMoPE through extensive experiments under various pretraining strategies and multiple downstream tasks. Results show that GMoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves performance comparable to full parameter fine-tuning-while requiring only a fraction of the adaptation overhead. Our work provides a principled and scalable framework for advancing generalizable and efficient graph foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphCliff: Short-Long Range Gating for Subtle Differences but Critical Changes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03170v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative structure-activity relationship assumes a smooth relationship between molecular structure and biological activity. However, activity cliffs defined as pairs of structurally similar compounds with large potency differences break this continuity. Recent benchmarks targeting activity cliffs have revealed that classical machine learning models with extended connectivity fingerprints outperform graph neural networks. Our analysis shows that graph embeddings fail to adequately separate structurally similar molecules in the embedding space, making it difficult to distinguish between structurally similar but functionally different molecules. Despite this limitation, molecular graph structures are inherently expressive and attractive, as they preserve molecular topology. To preserve the structural representation of molecules as graphs, we propose a new model, GraphCliff, which integrates short- and long-range information through a gating mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphCliff consistently improves performance on both non-cliff and cliff compounds. Furthermore, layer-wise node embedding analyses reveal reduced over-smoothing and enhanced discriminative power relative to strong baseline graph models.</p></details> |  |

In this work we stray away from this tradition and provide a principled way to measure similarity between vertex attributed graphs. We denote this measure as the \emph{graph homomorphism distortion}. We show it can \emph{completely characterize} graphs and thus is also a \emph{complete graph embedding}. However, somewhere along the road, we run into the graph canonization problem. To circumvent this obstacle, we devise to efficiently compute this measure via sampling, which in expectation ensures \emph{completeness}. Additionally, we also discovered that we can obtain a metric from this measure. We validate our claims empirically and find that the \emph{graph homomorphism distortion}: (1.) fully distinguishes the \texttt{BREC} dataset with up to $4$-WL non-distinguishable graphs, and (2.) \emph{outperforms} previous methods inspired in homomorphisms under the \texttt{ZINC-12k} dataset. These theoretical results, (and their empirical validation), pave the way for future characterization of graphs, extending the graph theoretic tradition to new frontiers.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Pavement Management Systems (PMS) remain largely reactive, lacking real-time intelligence for failure prevention and optimal maintenance planning. To address this, we propose a unified Digital Twin (DT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for scalable, data-driven pavement health monitoring and predictive maintenance. Pavement segments and spatial relations are modeled as graph nodes and edges, while real-time UAV, sensor, and LiDAR data stream into the DT. The inductive GNN learns deterioration patterns from graph-structured inputs to forecast distress and enable proactive interventions. Trained on a real-world-inspired dataset with segment attributes and dynamic connectivity, our model achieves an R2 of 0.3798, outperforming baseline regressors and effectively capturing non-linear degradation. We also develop an interactive dashboard and reinforcement learning module for simulation, visualization, and adaptive maintenance planning. This DT-GNN integration enhances forecasting precision and establishes a closed feedback loop for continuous improvement, positioning the approach as a foundation for proactive, intelligent, and sustainable pavement management, with future extensions toward real-world deployment, multi-agent coordination, and smart-city integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Graph Neural Networks for Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02531v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object Detection as an Optional Basis: A Graph Matching Network for Cross-View UAV Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02489v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas, satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view, heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations, or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment, content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps, such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, Submitted to IEEE TIM</p></details> |

This paper presents HybridST, a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), multi-head temporal Transformers, and supervised ensemble learning methods (XGBoost or Random Forest) to collectively capture spatial dependencies, long-range temporal patterns, and exogenous signals, including weather, calendar, or control states. We test our model on the METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and Seattle Loop tree public benchmark datasets. These datasets include situations ranging from freeway sensor networks to vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception. Experimental results show that HybridST consistently beats classical baselines (LSTM, GCN, DCRNN, PDFormer) on important metrics like MAE and RMSE, while still being very scalable and easy to understand. The proposed framework presents a promising avenue for real-time urban mobility planning, energy optimization, and congestion alleviation strategies, especially within the framework of smart cities and significant events such as the 2030 FIFA World Cup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Link Prediction with Untrained Message Passing Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16687v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) operate on graphs by exchanging information between neigbouring nodes. MPNNs have been successfully applied to various node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks in areas like molecular science, computer vision, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, most MPNNs require training on large amounts of labeled data, which can be costly and time-consuming. In this work, we explore the use of various untrained message passing layers in graph neural networks, i.e. variants of popular message passing architecture where we remove all trainable parameters that are used to transform node features in the message passing step. Focusing on link prediction, we find that untrained message passing layers can lead to competitive and even superior performance compared to fully trained MPNNs, especially in the presence of high-dimensional features. We provide a theoretical analysis of untrained message passing by relating the inner products of features implicitly produced by untrained message passing layers to path-based topological node similarity measures. As such, untrained message passing architectures can be viewed as a highly efficient and interpretable approach to link prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolving Graph Learning for Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Non-stationary Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02354v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial and temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Graph Neural Architecture Search via Monte-Carlo Tree Search (Full version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15734v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The number of graph neural network (GNN) architectures has increased rapidly due to the growing adoption of graph analysis. Although we use GNNs in wide application scenarios, it is a laborious task to design/select optimal GNN architectures in diverse graphs. To reduce human efforts, graph neural architecture search (Graph NAS) has been used to search for a sub-optimal GNN architecture that combines existing components. However, existing Graph NAS methods lack explainability to understand the reasons why the model architecture is selected because they use complex search space and neural models to select architecture. Therefore, we propose an explainable Graph NAS method, called ExGNAS, which consists of (i) a simple search space that can adapt to various graphs and (ii) a search algorithm with Monte-Carlo tree that makes the decision process explainable. The combination of our search space and algorithm achieves finding accurate GNN models and the important functions within the search space. We comprehensively evaluate ExGNAS compared with four state-of-the-art Graph NAS methods in twelve graphs. Our experimental results show that ExGNAS achieves high average accuracy and efficiency; improving accuracy up to 26.1% and reducing run time up to 88%. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of explainability by questionnaire-based user study and architecture analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional federated recommendation approaches treat each user as an isolated entity, failing to construct global user relationship graphs that capture collaborative signals, which limits the accuracy of recommendations. To address this limitation, we derive insight from the insight that semantic similarity reflects preference. similarity, which can be used to improve the construction of user relationship graphs. This paper proposes UFGraphFR, a novel framework with three key components: 1) On the client side, private structured data is first transformed into text descriptions. These descriptions are then encoded into semantic vectors using pre-trained models; 2) On the server side, user relationship graphs are securely reconstructed using aggregated model weights without accessing raw data, followed by information propagation through lightweight graph neural networks; 3) On the client side, user behavior sequences are personalized using Transformer architectures. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that UFGraphFR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both recommendation accuracy and personalization. The framework also maintains robustness across different pre-trained models, as evidenced by the consistent performance metrics obtained. This work provides a practical method for efficient federated recommendations with strict privacy by using semantic vectors, secure user relationship graphs, and personalized behavior sequences.

Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches. Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained 81.51\% accuracy, 85.94\% sensitivity, 76.36\% specificity, 80.88\% precision, and 83.33\% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific anatomical priors for MDD detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figure, 9 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH Asia 2025, project page: https://nxnai.github.io/Voost/</p></details> |
| **[Generative View Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24718v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free, frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase.

The governing partial differential equations that we solve are the electroneutral Navier-Stokes-Onsager-Stefan-Maxwell (NSOSM) equations, which model momentum transport, multicomponent diffusion and electrical effects within the electrolyte. Our algorithms can be applied in the steady and transient settings, in two and three spatial dimensions, and under a variety of boundary conditions. Moreover, we allow for the material parameters (e.g. viscosity, diffusivities, thermodynamic factors and density) to be solution-dependent and thermodynamically non-ideal. The flexibility of our approach requires us to address subtleties that arise in the governing equations due to the interplay between boundary conditions and the equation of state. We demonstrate the algorithms in various physical configurations, including (i) electrolyte flow around a microfluidic rotating disk electrode and (ii) the flow in a Hull cell of a cosolvent electrolyte mixture used in lithium-ion batteries.</p></details> |  |

However, CFG requires specific training procedures and is limited to conditional generation. To address these limitations, we propose Token Perturbation Guidance (TPG), a novel method that applies perturbation matrices directly to intermediate token representations within the diffusion network. TPG employs a norm-preserving shuffling operation to provide effective and stable guidance signals that improve generation quality without architectural changes. As a result, TPG is training-free and agnostic to input conditions, making it readily applicable to both conditional and unconditional generation. We further analyze the guidance term provided by TPG and show that its effect on sampling more closely resembles CFG compared to existing training-free guidance techniques. Extensive experiments on SDXL and Stable Diffusion 2.1 show that TPG achieves nearly a 2$\times$ improvement in FID for unconditional generation over the SDXL baseline, while closely matching CFG in prompt alignment. These results establish TPG as a general, condition-agnostic guidance method that brings CFG-like benefits to a broader class of diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025.

We present a learning-based estimator to predict diffuse indirect illumination in screen space, which then is combined with direct illumination to synthesize globally-illuminated high dynamic range (HDR) results. Our approach tackles the challenges of capturing long-range/long-distance indirect illumination when employing neural networks and is generalized to handle complex lighting and scenarios. From the neural network thinking of the solver to the rendering equation, we present a novel network architecture to predict indirect illumination. Our network is equipped with a modified attention mechanism that aggregates global information guided by spacial geometry features, as well as a monochromatic design that encodes each color channel individually. We conducted extensive evaluations, and the experimental results demonstrate our superiority over previous learning-based techniques. Our approach excels at handling complex lighting such as varying-colored lighting and environment lighting. It can successfully capture distant indirect illumination and simulates the interreflections between textured surfaces well (i.e., color bleeding effects); it can also effectively handle new scenes that are not present in the training dataset.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Existing approaches usually require task-specific training and struggle to generalize across both concrete (e.g., objects) and abstract (e.g., styles) concepts. We propose CASteer (Cross-Attention Steering), a training-free framework for concept erasure in diffusion models using steering vectors to influence hidden representations dynamically. CASteer precomputes concept-specific steering vectors by averaging neural activations from images generated for each target concept. During inference, it dynamically applies these vectors to suppress undesired concepts only when they appear, ensuring that unrelated regions remain unaffected. This selective activation enables precise, context-aware erasure without degrading overall image quality. This approach achieves effective removal of harmful or unwanted content across a wide range of visual concepts, all without model retraining. CASteer outperforms state-of-the-art concept erasure techniques while preserving unrelated content and minimizing unintended effects. Pseudocode is provided in the supplementary.</p></details> |  |
| **[An efficient asymptotic preserving Monte Carlo method for frequency-dependent radiative transfer equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02392v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we develop an efficient asymptotic-preserving (AP) Monte Carlo (MC) method for frequency-dependent radiative transfer equations (RTEs), which is based on the AP-MC method proposed for the gray RTEs in \cite{shi2023efficient}. We follow the characteristics-based approach by Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2023asymptotic} to get a reformulated model, which couples a low dimension convection-diffusion-type equation for macroscopic quantities with a high dimension transport equation for the radiative intensity. To recover the correct free streaming limit due to frequency-dependency, we propose a correction to the reformulated macroscopic equation. The macroscopic system is solved using a hybrid method: convective fluxes are handled by a particle-based MC method, while diffusive fluxes are treated implicitly with central difference. To address the nonlinear coupling between radiative intensity and the Planck function across multiple frequency groups, we adopt a Picard iteration with a predictor-corrector procedure, which decouples a global nonlinear system into a linear system restricted to spatial dimension (independent of frequency) with scalar algebraic nonlinear equations. Once the macroscopic update is done, the transport equation, with a known emission source provided by the macroscopic variables, is efficiently solved using an implicit MC method. This approach enables larger time steps independent of the speed of light and also the frequency across a wide range, significantly enhancing computational efficiency, especially for frequency-dependent RTEs. Formal AP analysis in the diffusive scaling is established. Numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the high efficiency and AP property of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Current caching techniques accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant, motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to 10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and effectiveness.

As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes FUSAR-KLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into remote sensing research, constructing FUSAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT), providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships. (3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11 representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons against 14 leading foundation models, where FUSAR-KLIP demonstrates leading performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We expect that FUSAR-KLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment and provide a straightforward implementation. By theoretical analysis, our framework is feasible to achieve superior cross-domain generalization for counting. In the presented network, the features related to density are explicitly preserved across domains. Theoretically, we formalize the notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets and measuring divergences per condition. We then derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with varying density distributions.

A fundamental challenge, however, has been overlooked: annotation points are typically placed on class-representative locations (e.g., heads), forcing models to focus on class-level features while neglecting attribute information from other visual regions (e.g., legs for "walking"). To address this, we propose W2-Net, a novel framework that explicitly decouples the problem into "what to count" and "where to see" via a dual-query mechanism. Specifically, alongside the standard what-to-count (w2c) queries that localize the object, we introduce dedicated where-to-see (w2s) queries. The w2s queries are guided to seek and extract features from attribute-specific visual regions, enabling precise subclass discrimination. Furthermore, we introduce Subclass Separable Matching (SSM), a novel matching strategy that incorporates a repulsive force to enhance inter-subclass separability during label assignment. W2-Net significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the REC-8K dataset, reducing counting error by 22.5% (validation) and 18.0% (test), and improving localization F1 by 7% and 8%, respectively. Code will be available.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we present a training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with prompts compared to recent text-to-image models.

However, most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2, which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2 enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception, advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 tables, 6 figures.

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original number of inference steps, significantly improving sampling efficiency without sacrificing performance. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For compositional generation, RL-tuned SD3.5-M generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, increasing GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, greatly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

Existing methods typically rely on vision-language models like CLIP, but often exhibit limited sensitivity to text prompts. We present T2ICount, a diffusion-based framework that leverages rich prior knowledge and fine-grained visual understanding from pretrained diffusion models. While one-step denoising ensures efficiency, it leads to weakened text sensitivity. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic Correction Module that progressively refines text-image feature alignment, and a Representational Regional Coherence Loss that provides reliable supervision signals by leveraging the cross-attention maps extracted from the denosing U-Net. Furthermore, we observe that current benchmarks mainly focus on majority objects in images, potentially masking models' text sensitivity. To address this, we contribute a challenging re-annotated subset of FSC147 for better evaluation of text-guided counting ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across different benchmarks.

| **[[De|Re]constructing VLMs' Reasoning in Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19555v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial, temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames), and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement, and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving consistent improvements on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically incorporate auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However, since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics, thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios) demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy (e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark), with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.</p></details> | 24 pages, 14 figures |

This is a nontrivial extension of the TPD method [Chen et al. (2025) SIAM J. Sci. Comput.] incorporating proximal splitting techniques to address the challenges arising from the nonsmoothness of the objective function. Our key contributions include: (i) a semi-implicit-explicit iterative scheme that combines proximal gradient steps with explicit gradient steps to treat the nonsmooth and smooth terms respectively; (ii) variable-dependent preconditioners constructed from the Hessian of a regularized objective to balance iteration count and per-iteration cost; (iii) a proof of existence and uniqueness of bounded solutions for the generalized proximal operator with the chosen preconditioner, along with a convergent and bound-preserving Newton solver; and (iv) an adaptive step-size strategy to improve robustness and accelerate convergence under poor Lipschitz conditions of the energy derivative. Comprehensive numerical experiments spanning from 1D to 3D settings demonstrate that our method achieves superior computational efficiency-achieving up to a 20$\times$ speedup over existing methods-thereby highlighting its broad applicability through several challenging simulations.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

However, complex disaster scenes with diverse disaster types, geographic regions, and satellite sensors have posed new challenges for VLM applications. To fill this gap, we curate a remote sensing vision-language dataset (DisasterM3) for global-scale disaster assessment and response. DisasterM3 includes 26,988 bi-temporal satellite images and 123k instruction pairs across 5 continents, with three characteristics: 1) Multi-hazard: DisasterM3 involves 36 historical disaster events with significant impacts, which are categorized into 10 common natural and man-made disasters. 2)Multi-sensor: Extreme weather during disasters often hinders optical sensor imaging, making it necessary to combine Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for post-disaster scenes. 3) Multi-task: Based on real-world scenarios, DisasterM3 includes 9 disaster-related visual perception and reasoning tasks, harnessing the full potential of VLM's reasoning ability with progressing from disaster-bearing body recognition to structural damage assessment and object relational reasoning, culminating in the generation of long-form disaster reports. We extensively evaluated 14 generic and remote sensing VLMs on our benchmark, revealing that state-of-the-art models struggle with the disaster tasks, largely due to the lack of a disaster-specific corpus, cross-sensor gap, and damage object counting insensitivity. Focusing on these issues, we fine-tune four VLMs using our dataset and achieve stable improvements across all tasks, with robust cross-sensor and cross-disaster generalization capabilities.

Existing models often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of 73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted at ICCV Conference 2025</p></details> |

However, existing open-vocabulary and visual grounding methods rely on explicit category cues, limiting their ability to handle complex or implicit queries that require advanced reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce a new suite of tasks, including Instruction-Oriented Object Counting, Detection, and Segmentation (InstructCDS), covering open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass scenarios. We further present EarthInstruct, the first InstructCDS benchmark for earth observation. It is constructed from two diverse remote sensing datasets with varying spatial resolutions and annotation rules across 20 categories, necessitating models to interpret dataset-specific instructions. Given the scarcity of semantically rich labeled data in remote sensing, we propose InstructSAM, a training-free framework for instruction-driven object recognition. InstructSAM leverages large vision-language models to interpret user instructions and estimate object counts, employs SAM2 for mask proposal, and formulates mask-label assignment as a binary integer programming problem. By integrating semantic similarity with counting constraints, InstructSAM efficiently assigns categories to predicted masks without relying on confidence thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that InstructSAM matches or surpasses specialized baselines across multiple tasks while maintaining near-constant inference time regardless of object count, reducing output tokens by 89% and overall runtime by over 32% compared to direct generation approaches. We believe the contributions of the proposed tasks, benchmark, and effective approach will advance future research in developing versatile object recognition systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While many text-to-image models prioritize aesthetics over accessibility, it is not clear how visual illustrations relate to text simplifications (TS) generated from them. This paper presents a structured vision-language model (VLM) prompting framework for generating accessible images from simplified texts. We designed five prompt templates, i.e., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, Educational Layout, Multi-Level Detail, and Grid Layout, each following distinct spatial arrangements while adhering to accessibility constraints such as object count limits, spatial separation, and content restrictions. Using 400 sentence-level simplifications from four established TS datasets (OneStopEnglish, SimPA, Wikipedia, and ASSET), we conducted a two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assessed prompt template effectiveness with CLIPScores, and Phase 2 involved human annotation of generated images across ten visual styles by four accessibility experts. Results show that the Basic Object Focus prompt template achieved the highest semantic alignment, indicating that visual minimalism enhances language accessibility. Expert evaluation further identified Retro style as the most accessible and Wikipedia as the most effective data source. Inter-annotator agreement varied across dimensions, with Text Simplicity showing strong reliability and Image Quality proving more subjective. Overall, our framework offers practical guidelines for accessible content generation and underscores the importance of structured prompting in AI-generated visual accessibility tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Numerosity in Diffusion Models -- Limitations and Remedies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11117v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6 featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization across settings.</p></details> |  |

While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation, axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image generative models.</p></details> |  |

A persistent challenge, however, is disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational circuits.</p></details> |  |

This widespread deep-layer bias, however, is largely driven by empirical convention rather than principled analysis. While prior studies suggest that different ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, the impact of this variation on MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present the first comprehensive study of visual layer selection for MLLMs, analyzing representation similarity across ViT layers to establish shallow, middle, and deep layer groupings. Through extensive evaluation of MLLMs (1.4B-7B parameters) across 10 benchmarks encompassing 60+ tasks, we find that while deep layers excel in semantic-rich tasks like OCR, shallow and middle layers significantly outperform them on fine-grained visual tasks including counting, positioning, and object localization. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight feature fusion method that strategically incorporates shallower layers, achieving consistent improvements over both single-layer and specialized fusion baselines. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, showing that MLLMs can often see better when they look shallower.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, accepted by EMNLP2025</p></details> |

We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/VIRAL/</p></details> |

However, multi-object scenes remain challenging, as reliable control over object categories, counts, and spatial layout is difficult to achieve. For that, we first study quantity and layout consistent image editing, abbreviated as QL-Edit, which targets control of object quantity and spatial layout in multi-object scenes. Then, we present IMAGHarmony, a straightforward framework featuring a plug-and-play harmony aware (HA) module that fuses perception semantics while modeling object counts and locations, resulting in accurate edits and strong structural consistency. We further observe that diffusion models are sensitive to the choice of initial noise and tend to prefer certain noise patterns. Based on this finding, we present a preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that selects semantically aligned initial noise through vision and language matching, thereby further improving generation stability and layout consistency in multiple object editing. To support evaluation, we develop HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers a diverse range of quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGHarmony outperforms prior methods in both structural alignment and semantic accuracy, utilizing only 200 training images and 10.6M of trainable parameters.

However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP). Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector, MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will release data, models, and code on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Measuring Directional Bias Amplification in Image Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07878v4)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When we train models on biased datasets, they not only reproduce data biases, but can worsen them at test time - a phenomenon called bias amplification. Many of the current bias amplification metrics (e.g., BA (MALS), DPA) measure bias amplification only in classification datasets. These metrics are ineffective for image captioning datasets, as they cannot capture the language semantics of a caption. Recent work introduced Leakage in Captioning (LIC), a language-aware bias amplification metric that understands caption semantics. However, LIC has a crucial limitation: it cannot identify the source of bias amplification in captioning models. We propose Directional Bias Amplification in Captioning (DBAC), a language-aware and directional metric that can identify when captioning models amplify biases. DBAC has two more improvements over LIC: (1) it is less sensitive to sentence encoders (a hyperparameter in language-aware metrics), and (2) it provides a more accurate estimate of bias amplification in captions. Our experiments on gender and race attributes in the COCO captions dataset show that DBAC is the only reliable metric to measure bias amplification in captions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically rely on manually crafted string IDs, clustering-based labels, or atomic identifiers requiring vocabulary expansion, all of which face challenges in semantic alignment or scalability.To address these limitations, we propose a vocabulary-efficient identifier generation framework that prompts MLLMs to generate Structured Semantic Identifiers from image-caption pairs. These identifiers are composed of concept-level tokens such as objects and actions, naturally aligning with the model's generation space without modifying the tokenizer. Additionally, we introduce a Rationale-Guided Supervision Strategy, prompting the model to produce a one-sentence explanation alongside each identifier serves as an auxiliary supervision signal that improves semantic grounding and reduces hallucinations during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>We pl...</summary><p>We plan to revise the methodology and update the experimental analysis before resubmission</p></details> |

The term Natural Language Generation (NLG), in its broadest definition, refers to the study of systems that verbalize some form of information through natural language. That information could be stored in a large database or knowledge graph (in data-to-text applications), but NLG researchers may also study summarisation (text-to-text) or image captioning (image-to-text), for example. As a subfield of Natural Language Processing, NLG is closely related to other sub-disciplines such as Machine Translation (MT) and Dialog Systems. Some NLG researchers exclude MT from their definition of the field, since there is no content selection involved where the system has to determine what to say. Conversely, dialog systems do not typically fall under the header of Natural Language Generation since NLG is just one component of dialog systems (the others being Natural Language Understanding and Dialog Management). However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), different subfields of Natural Language Processing have converged on similar methodologies for the production of natural language and the evaluation of automatically generated text.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages + references.

| **[Efficient Test-Time Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01059v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities, their reliance on parametric knowledge often leads to inaccuracies. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, but these methods may introduce irrelevant retrieved documents, leading to inaccurate responses. While the integration methods filter out incorrect answers from multiple responses, but lack external knowledge like RAG methods, and their high costs require balancing overhead with performance gains. To address these issues, we propose an Efficient Test-Time Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework named ET2RAG to improve the performance of LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, ET2RAG is a training-free method, that first retrieves the most relevant documents and augments the LLMs to efficiently generate diverse candidate responses by managing response length. Then we compute the similarity of candidate responses and employ a majority voting mechanism to select the most suitable response as the final output. In particular, we discover that partial generation is sufficient to capture the key information necessary for consensus calculation, allowing us to effectively perform majority voting without the need for fully generated responses. Thus, we can reach a balance between computational cost and performance by managing the response length for the number of retrieved documents for majority voting. Experimental results demonstrate that ET2RAG significantly enhances performance across three tasks, including open-domain question answering, recipe generation and image captioning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fleming-VL: Towards Universal Medical Visual Reasoning with Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00916v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in various general-domain scenarios, such as visual question answering and image captioning. Recently, researchers have increasingly focused on empowering MLLMs with medical conversational abilities, which hold significant promise for clinical applications. However, medical data presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneous nature -- encompassing diverse modalities including 2D images, 3D volumetric scans, and temporal video sequences. The substantial domain gap and data format inconsistencies across these modalities have hindered the development of unified medical MLLMs. To address these challenges, we propose Fleming-VL, a unified end-to-end framework for comprehensive medical visual understanding across heterogeneous modalities. Fleming-VL tackles this problem from a data-centric perspective through three key strategies: (1) scaling up pretraining by integrating long-context data from both natural and medical-specific domains; (2) complementing fine-tuning with rare medical data, including holistic video analysis and underrepresented 2D modalities such as ultrasound and dermoscopy images; (3) extending existing evaluation frameworks to incorporate 3D volumetric and video understanding benchmarks. Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), we develop Fleming-VL in multiple model scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fleming-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including medical VQA, video QA, and 3D medical image understanding. We publicly release Fleming-VL to promote transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI.</p></details> |  |

Prompt inversion, the task of identifying the textual prompt used to generate a specific artifact, holds significant potential for applications including data attribution, model provenance, and watermarking validation. Recent studies introduced a delayed projection scheme to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space, though challenges in semantic fluency and efficiency remain. Advanced image captioning models or visual large language models can generate highly interpretable prompts, but they often lack in image similarity. In this paper, we propose a prompt inversion technique called \sys for text-to-image diffusion models, which includes initializing embeddings using a pre-trained image captioning model, refining them through reverse-engineering in the latent space, and converting them to texts using an embedding-to-text model. Our experiments on the widely-used datasets, such as MS COCO, LAION, and Flickr, show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of image similarity, textual alignment, prompt interpretability and generalizability. We further illustrate the application of our generated prompts in tasks such as cross-concept image synthesis, concept manipulation, evolutionary multi-concept generation and unsupervised segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Hierarchical Image-Text Misalignment for Universal Fake Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00427v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of generative models, detecting generated fake images to prevent their malicious use has become a critical issue recently. Existing methods frame this challenge as a naive binary image classification task. However, such methods focus only on visual clues, yielding trained detectors susceptible to overfitting specific image patterns and incapable of generalizing to unseen models. In this paper, we address this issue from a multi-modal perspective and find that fake images cannot be properly aligned with corresponding captions compared to real images. Upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective detector termed ITEM by leveraging the image-text misalignment in a joint visual-language space as discriminative clues. Specifically, we first measure the misalignment of the images and captions in pre-trained CLIP's space, and then tune a MLP head to perform the usual detection task. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical misalignment scheme that first focuses on the whole image and then each semantic object described in the caption, which can explore both global and fine-grained local semantic misalignment as clues. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method against other state-of-the-art competitors with impressive generalization and robustness on various recent generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Accurate and Detailed Captions for High-Resolution Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27164v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels). Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models, large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused, region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work conducted in 2024; released for archival purposes</p></details> |

| **[Masked Diffusion Captioning for Visual Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26799v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Findings).

Understanding sarcastic image-text posts often requires external contextual knowledge, such as cultural references or commonsense reasoning. However, existing models struggle to capture the deeper rationale behind sarcasm, relying mainly on shallow cues like image captions or object-attribute pairs from images. To address this, we propose \textbf{MiDRE} (\textbf{Mi}xture of \textbf{D}ual \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{E}xperts), which integrates an internal reasoning expert for detecting incongruities within the image-text pair and an external reasoning expert that utilizes structured rationales generated via Chain-of-Thought prompting to a Large Vision-Language Model. An adaptive gating mechanism dynamically weighs the two experts, selecting the most relevant reasoning path. Unlike prior methods that treat external knowledge as static input, MiDRE selectively adapts to when such knowledge is beneficial, mitigating the risks of hallucinated or irrelevant signals from large models. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MiDRE achieves superior performance over baselines. Various qualitative analyses highlight the crucial role of external rationales, revealing that even when they are occasionally noisy, they provide valuable cues that guide the model toward a better understanding of sarcasm.</p></details> |  |

The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly towards developing robust ML models.

However, these models often struggle with compositional reasoning - the ability to understand the relationships between concepts. A recent benchmark, SugarCrepe++, reveals that previous works on improving compositionality have mainly improved lexical sensitivity but neglected semantic understanding. In addition, downstream retrieval performance often deteriorates, although one would expect that improving compositionality should enhance retrieval. In this work, we introduce CLIC (Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP), a fine-tuning method based on a novel training technique combining multiple images and their associated captions. CLIC improves compositionality across architectures as well as differently pre-trained CLIP models, both in terms of lexical and semantic understanding, and achieves consistent gains in retrieval performance. This even applies to the recent CLIPS, which achieves SOTA retrieval performance. Nevertheless, the short fine-tuning with CLIC leads to an improvement in retrieval and to the best compositional CLIP model on SugarCrepe++.

Investigating multimodal in-context learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24331v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration. These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal in-context examples.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically, salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[MsEdF: A Multi-stream Encoder-decoder Framework for Remote Sensing Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09282v4)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing images contain complex spatial patterns and semantic structures, which makes the captioning model difficult to accurately describe. Encoder-decoder architectures have become the widely used approach for RSIC by translating visual content into descriptive text. However, many existing methods rely on a single-stream architecture, which weakens the model to accurately describe the image. Such single-stream architectures typically struggle to extract diverse spatial features or capture complex semantic relationships, limiting their effectiveness in scenes with high intraclass similarity or contextual ambiguity. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-stream Encoder-decoder Framework (MsEdF) which improves the performance of RSIC by optimizing both the spatial representation and language generation of encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder fuses information from two complementary image encoders, thereby promoting feature diversity through the integration of multiscale and structurally distinct cues. To improve the capture of context-aware descriptions, we refine the input sequence's semantic modeling on the decoder side using a stacked GRU architecture with an element-wise aggregation scheme. Experiments on three benchmark RSIC datasets show that MsEdF outperforms several baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstruction Alignment Improves Unified Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07295v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours, post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit 6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 28 figures and 11 tables; Update ablation study</p></details> |

Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can enable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple question-answer pairs. In this paper, we aim to train visual language models (VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and visual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning to a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before providing an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy questions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data distributions. We argue that the key to mitigating shortcut learning is to encourage the model to interpret images prior to reasoning. Therefore, we train the model to adhere to a caption-reason-answer output format: initially generating a detailed caption for an image, followed by constructing an extensive reasoning chain. When trained on 273K CoT-free visual question-answer pairs and using only reinforcement learning, our model, named Visionary-R1, outperforms strong multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Top-Down Semantic Refinement for Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22391v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR), which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization, and hallucination suppression.</p></details> |  |

Previous work addresses node-private continual release by assuming an unenforced promise on the maximum degree in a graph, but leaves open whether such a bound can be verified or enforced privately. Our algorithms are accurate on sparse graphs, for several fundamental graph problems: counting edges, triangles, other subgraphs, and connected components; and releasing degree histograms. Our unconditionally private algorithms generally have optimal error, up to polylogarithmic factors and lower-order terms. We provide general transformations that take a base algorithm for the continual release setting, which need only be private for streams satisfying a promised degree bound, and produce an algorithm that is unconditionally private yet mimics the base algorithm when the stream meets the degree bound (and adds only linear overhead to the time and space complexity of the base algorithm). To do so, we design new projection algorithms for graph streams, based on the batch-model techniques of Day et al. 2016 and Blocki et al. 2013, which modify the stream to limit its degree. Our main technical innovation is to show that the projections are stable -- meaning that similar input graphs have similar projections -- when the input stream satisfies a privately testable safety condition. Our transformation then follows a novel online variant of the Propose-Test-Release framework (Dwork and Lei, 2009), privately testing the safety condition before releasing output at each step.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the paper presented at IEEE S&P 2024 ("Oakland")</p></details> |

Typically, this is done by adding carefully chosen noise to the sample proportion computed using the confidential data. In this article, we describe and compare methods for turning this differentially private proportion into an interval estimate for an underlying population probability. Specifically, we consider differentially private versions of the Wald and Wilson intervals, Bayesian credible intervals based on denoising the differentially private proportion, and an exact interval motivated by the Clopper-Pearson confidence interval. We examine the repeated sampling performances of the intervals using simulation studies under both the Laplace mechanism and discrete Gaussian mechanism across a range of privacy guarantees. We find that while several methods can offer reasonable performances, the Bayesian credible intervals are the most attractive.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we characterize the class of \emph{undirected 2-quasi-BMGs} (un2qBMGs), which form a proper subclass of the $P_6$-free chordal bipartite graphs. We show that un2qBMGs are exactly the class of bipartite graphs free of $P_6$, $C_6$, and the eight-vertex Sunlet$_4$ graph. Equivalently, a bipartite graph $G$ is un2qBMG if and only if every connected induced subgraph contains a ``heart-vertex'' which is adjacent to all the vertices of the opposite color. We further provide a $O(|V(G)|^3)$ algorithm for the recognition of un2qBMGs that, in the affirmative case, constructs a labeled rooted tree that ``explains'' $G$. Finally, since un2qBMGs coincide with the $(P_6,C_6)$-free bi-cographs, they can also be recognized in linear time.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

We construct periodic orbits in this configuration space using elliptic theta functions and show that they simultaneously satisfy semi-discrete analogues of mKdV and sine-Gordon equations. The configuration space we investigate corresponds to the state space of a linkage mechanism known as the Kaleidocycle, and the constructed orbits describe the characteristic motion of the Kaleidocycle. A key consequence of our construction is the proof that Kaleidocycles exist for any number of tetrahedra greater than five. Our approach is founded on the relationship between the deformation of spatial curves and integrable systems, offering an intriguing example where an integrable system is explicitly solved to generate an orbit in the space of real solutions to polynomial equations defined by geometric constraints.</p></details> |  |

However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.

We present memory-efficient algorithms that compute $\mathcal{\varepsilon}$--statistics related quantities by calculating pairwise distances on-the-fly rather than storing full distance matrices. Our methods achieve 5-156$\times$ speed improvements over existing implementations while reducing memory requirements from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$. These advances enable energy statistics computation with sample sizes exceeding tens of thousands observations-previously infeasible with standard implementations-facilitating their use in modern applications across statistics, bioinformatics, and machine learning where large-scale datasets are frequently met. The following cases are demonstrated: energy distance, univariate and multivariate distance variance, distance covariance, (partial) distance correlation and hypothesis testing for the equality of univariate distributions. Functions to compute the aforementioned energy statistics, among others, are available in the \textit{R} package \textsf{estats}.</p></details> |  |

Despite its rapid growth and broad potential, ABSA research and resources remain concentrated in commercial domains, leaving analytical needs unmet in high-demand yet low-resource areas such as education and healthcare. Domain adaptation challenges and most existing methods' reliance on resource-intensive in-training knowledge injection further hinder progress in these areas. Moreover, traditional evaluation methods based on exact matches are overly rigid for ABSA tasks, penalising any boundary variations which may misrepresent the performance of generative models. This work addresses these gaps through three contributions: 1) We propose a novel evaluation method, Flexible Text Similarity Matching and Optimal Bipartite Pairing (FTS-OBP), which accommodates realistic extraction boundary variations while maintaining strong correlation with traditional metrics and offering fine-grained diagnostics. 2) We present the first ABSA study of small decoder-only generative language models (SLMs; <7B parameters), examining resource lower bounds via a case study in education review ABSA. We systematically explore data-free (in-context learning and weight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods, and propose a multitask fine-tuning strategy that significantly enhances SLM performance, enabling 1.5-3.8 B models to surpass proprietary large models and approach benchmark results with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU. 3) We release the first public set of education review ABSA resources to support future research in low-resource domains.</p></details> |  |

Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks. Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture, we provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack detection approaches.

However, current deep learning-based polyp segmentation models either compromise clinical decision-making by providing ambiguous polyp margins in segmentation outputs or rely on heavy architectures with high computational complexity, resulting in insufficient inference speeds for real-time colorectal endoscopic applications. To address this problem, we propose MicroAUNet, a light-weighted attention-based segmentation network that combines depthwise-separable dilated convolutions with a single-path, parameter-shared channel-spatial attention block to strengthen multi-scale boundary features. On the basis of it, a progressive two-stage knowledge-distillation scheme is introduced to transfer semantic and boundary cues from a high-capacity teacher. Extensive experiments on benchmarks also demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy under extremely low model complexity, indicating that MicroAUNet is suitable for real-time clinical polyp segmentation. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/JeremyXSC/MicroAUNet.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Conventional deep learning methods are impractical due to resource limitations, while Federated Learning (FL) suffers from high communication overhead and vulnerability to non-IID (heterogeneous) data. In this paper, we propose a split learning (SL) based framework for IoT malware detection through image-based classification. By dividing the neural network training between the clients and an edge server, the framework reduces computational burden on resource-constrained clients while ensuring data privacy. We formulate a joint optimization problem that balances computation cost and communication efficiency by using a game-theoretic approach for attaining better training performance. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed framework outperforms popular FL methods in terms of accuracy (+6.35%), F1-score (+5.03%), high convergence speed (+14.96%), and less resource consumption (33.83%). These results establish the potential of SL as a scalable and secure paradigm for next-generation IoT security.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, Under review in an IEEE Transactions journal</p></details> |

In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy under ambient illumination.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures and 1 table</p></details> |

Current approaches extract the surface through costly post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds, with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior, our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics simulations or animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

By leveraging multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and transceiver designs, we engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment to emulate the operations of a CNN layer. To comprehensively evaluate AirCNN, we consider two types of CNNs, namely classic two-dimensional (2D) convolution (Conv2d) and light-weight convolution, i.e., depthwise separable convolution (ConvSD). For Conv2d realization via OTA computation, we propose and analyze two RIS-aided transmission architectures: multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO), balancing transmission overhead and emulation performance. We jointly optimize all parameters, including the transmitter precoder, receiver combiner, and RIS phase shifts, under practical constraints such as transmit power budget and unit-modulus phase shift requirements. We further extend the framework to ConvSD, which requires distinct transmission strategies for depthwise and pointwise convolutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AirCNN architectures can achieve satisfactory classification performance. Notably, Conv2d MISO consistently outperforms Conv2d MIMO across various settings, while for ConvSD, MISO is superior only under poor channel conditions. Moreover, employing multiple RISs significantly enhances performance compared to a single RIS, especially in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated wireless environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Using...</summary><p>Using wireless hardware to implement neural networks; This work is submitted to IEEE journal for possible publication</p></details> |

In this paper, we show that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and (2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn because the submission was premature and not agreed by all parties in collaboration</p></details> |

In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves as an "interlingua" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding, software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments, we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data are released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation have leveraged positional conditions and textual descriptions to facilitate precise and controllable image synthesis. Despite overall progress, current L2I methods still exhibit suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose InstanceAssemble, a novel architecture that incorporates layout conditions via instance-assembling attention, enabling position control with bounding boxes (bbox) and multimodal content control including texts and additional visual content. Our method achieves flexible adaption to existing DiT-based T2I models through light-weighted LoRA modules. Additionally, we propose a Layout-to-Image benchmark, Denselayout, a comprehensive benchmark for layout-to-image generation, containing 5k images with 90k instances in total. We further introduce Layout Grounding Score (LGS), an interpretable evaluation metric to more precisely assess the accuracy of L2I generation. Experiments demonstrate that our InstanceAssemble method achieves state-of-the-art performance under complex layout conditions, while exhibiting strong compatibility with diverse style LoRA modules.

| **[Approximate Light Spanners in Planar Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24825v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In their seminal paper, Alth\"{o}fer et al. (DCG 1993) introduced the {\em greedy spanner} and showed that, for any weighted planar graph $G$, the weight of the greedy $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner is at most $(1+\frac{2}{\epsilon}) \cdot w(MST(G))$, where $w(MST(G))$ is the weight of a minimum spanning tree $MST(G)$ of $G$. This bound is optimal in an {\em existential sense}: there exist planar graphs $G$ for which any $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner has a weight of at least $(1+\frac{2}{\epsilon}) \cdot w(MST(G))$. However, as an {\em approximation algorithm}, even for a {\em bicriteria} approximation, the weight approximation factor of the greedy spanner is essentially as large as the existential bound: There exist planar graphs $G$ for which the greedy $(1+x \epsilon)$-spanner (for any $1\leq x = O(\epsilon^{-1/2})$) has a weight of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\epsilon \cdot x^2})\cdot w(G_{OPT, \epsilon})$, where $G_{OPT, \epsilon}$ is a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner of $G$ of minimum weight. Despite the flurry of works over the past three decades on approximation algorithms for spanners as well as on light(-weight) spanners, there is still no (possibly bicriteria) approximation algorithm for light spanners in weighted planar graphs that outperforms the existential bound. As our main contribution, we present a polynomial time algorithm for constructing, in any weighted planar graph $G$, a $(1+\epsilon\cdot 2^{O(\log^* 1/\epsilon)})$-spanner for $G$ of total weight $O(1)\cdot w(G_{OPT, \epsilon})$. To achieve this result, we develop a new technique, which we refer to as {\em iterative planar pruning}. It iteratively modifies a spanner [...]</p></details> | <details><summary>SODA ...</summary><p>SODA 2026, abstract shortened to meet arXiv limit</p></details> |

Meanwhile, machine learning methods are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in this natural learning setting, as supervised specialist fine-tuning degrades performance on the original task. We introduce task-modulated contrastive learning (TMCL), which takes inspiration from the biophysical machinery in the neocortex, using predictive coding principles to integrate top-down information continually and without supervision. We follow the idea that these principles build a view-invariant representation space, and that this can be implemented using a contrastive loss. Then, whenever labeled samples of a new class occur, new affine modulations are learned that improve separation of the new class from all others, without affecting feedforward weights. By co-opting the view-invariance learning mechanism, we then train feedforward weights to match the unmodulated representation of a data sample to its modulated counterparts. This introduces modulation invariance into the representation space, and, by also using past modulations, stabilizes it. Our experiments show improvements in both class-incremental and transfer learning over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, as well as over comparable supervised approaches, using as few as 1% of available labels. Taken together, our work suggests that top-down modulations play a crucial role in balancing stability and plasticity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Parameterized Prompt for Incremental Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27316v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection (P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Bias of Per-sample Adam on Separable Data: Departure from the Full-batch Regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26303v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation. Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$ close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while Signum remains invariant.</p></details> | 50 pages |

However, existing GIL approaches focus on task-incremental and class-incremental scenarios within a single domain. Graph domain-incremental learning (Domain-IL), aiming at updating models across multiple graph domains, has become critical with the development of graph foundation models (GFMs), but remains unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we propose Graph Domain-Incremental Learning via Knowledge Dientanglement and Preservation (GraphKeeper), to address catastrophic forgetting in Domain-IL scenario from the perspectives of embedding shifts and decision boundary deviations. Specifically, to prevent embedding shifts and confusion across incremental graph domains, we first propose the domain-specific parameter-efficient fine-tuning together with intra- and inter-domain disentanglement objectives. Consequently, to maintain a stable decision boundary, we introduce deviation-free knowledge preservation to continuously fit incremental domains. Additionally, for graphs with unobservable domains, we perform domain-aware distribution discrimination to obtain precise embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed GraphKeeper achieves state-of-the-art results with 6.5%~16.6% improvement over the runner-up with negligible forgetting. Moreover, we show GraphKeeper can be seamlessly integrated with various representative GFMs, highlighting its broad applicative potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Main Track of NeurIPS-2025</p></details> |

The dominantly adopted conventional evaluation protocol for CL algorithms selects the best hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, mini-batch size, regularization strengths, etc.) within a given scenario and then evaluates the algorithms using these hyperparameters in the same scenario. However, this protocol has significant shortcomings: it overestimates the CL capacity of algorithms and relies on unrealistic hyperparameter tuning, which is not feasible for real-world applications. From the fundamental principles of evaluation in machine learning, we argue that the evaluation of CL algorithms should focus on assessing the generalizability of their CL capacity to unseen scenarios. Based on this, we propose the Generalizable Two-phase Evaluation Protocol (GTEP) consisting of hyperparameter tuning and evaluation phases. Both phases share the same scenario configuration (e.g., number of tasks) but are generated from different datasets. Hyperparameters of CL algorithms are tuned in the first phase and applied in the second phase to evaluate the algorithms. We apply this protocol to class-incremental learning, both with and without pretrained models. Across more than 8,000 experiments, our results show that most state-of-the-art algorithms fail to replicate their reported performance, highlighting that their CL capacity has been significantly overestimated in the conventional evaluation protocol. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/csm9493/GTEP.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025 camera ready version</p></details> |

Class-Continual Learning (CCL) addresses this challenge by incrementally incorporating new class knowledge without revisiting historical data, making it essential for real-world big data applications. While traditional CCL methods rely solely on visual features, recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate significant potential for CCL by leveraging pre-trained multi-modal knowledge. However, existing approaches face challenges in mitigating catastrophic forgetting while maintaining the cross-modal generalization capabilities of VLMs. To address these limitations, we propose CalFuse, a framework that synergizes feature Calibration with parameter Fusion to enable effective multi-modal knowledge integration in continual learning scenarios. CalFuse introduces a dynamic feature calibration mechanism that adaptively balances original CLIP visual representations with task-specific features, preserving the model's intrinsic cross-modal generalization while adapting to new classes. Concurrently, a QR decomposition-based parameter fusion strategy progressively integrates newly acquired knowledge with historical task parameters, maintaining equilibrium between learning new class representations and retaining prior knowledge across sequential tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in large-scale multi-modal continual learning settings, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both average accuracy and final task retention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Randomized Neural Network with Adaptive Forward Regularization for Online Task-free Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21367v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization, has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R) in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention. edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning. Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Car Models in Time (CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models, a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023), supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging, evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies: time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs. CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained visual recognition and generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in NeurIPS 2025 Track on Datasets and Benchmarks</p></details> |

Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS'25 Accepted, Oral</p></details> |

However, existing replay-based CIL methods fail to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to severe domain discrepancies and class imbalance inherent in endoscopic imaging. To tackle these challenges, we propose EndoCIL, a novel and unified CIL framework specifically tailored for endoscopic image diagnosis. EndoCIL incorporates three key components: Maximum Mean Discrepancy Based Replay (MDBR), employing a distribution-aligned greedy strategy to select diverse and representative exemplars, Prior Regularized Class Balanced Loss (PRCBL), designed to alleviate both inter-phase and intra-phase class imbalance by integrating prior class distributions and balance weights into the loss function, and Calibration of Fully-Connected Gradients (CFG), which adjusts the classifier gradients to mitigate bias toward new classes. Extensive experiments conducted on four public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that EndoCIL generally outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods across varying buffer sizes and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework effectively balances stability and plasticity in lifelong endoscopic diagnosis, showing promising potential for clinical scalability and deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning After Model Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17160v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In classic supervised learning, once a model is deployed in an application, it is fixed. No updates will be made to it during the application. This is inappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples from unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be able to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after they are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model Deployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human engineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other knowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an unfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection of novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new classes are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in traditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised learning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and incrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the past data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered classes, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two challenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes often appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and incremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will demonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ECAI-2025</p></details> |
| **[The Bayesian Approach to Continual Learning: An Overview](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08922v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is an online paradigm where a learner continually accumulates knowledge from different tasks encountered over sequential time steps. Importantly, the learner is required to extend and update its knowledge without forgetting about the learning experience acquired from the past, and while avoiding the need to retrain from scratch. Given its sequential nature and its resemblance to the way humans think, continual learning offers an opportunity to address several challenges which currently stand in the way of widening the range of applicability of deep models to further real-world problems. The continual need to update the learner with data arriving sequentially strikes inherent congruence between continual learning and Bayesian inference which provides a principal platform to keep updating the prior beliefs of a model given new data, without completely forgetting the knowledge acquired from the old data. This survey inspects different settings of Bayesian continual learning, namely task-incremental learning and class-incremental learning. We begin by discussing definitions of continual learning along with its Bayesian setting, as well as the links with related fields, such as domain adaptation, transfer learning and meta-learning. Afterwards, we introduce a taxonomy offering a comprehensive categorization of algorithms belonging to the Bayesian continual learning paradigm. Meanwhile, we analyze the state-of-the-art while zooming in on some of the most prominent Bayesian continual learning algorithms to date. Furthermore, we shed some light on links between continual learning and developmental psychology, and correspondingly introduce analogies between both fields. We follow that with a discussion of current challenges, and finally conclude with potential areas for future research on Bayesian continual learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Classifier Synergy: Reward-Aligned Learning via Mutual Boosting Loop for FSCIL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03608v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation, their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[FedGTEA: Federated Class-Incremental Learning with Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12927v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning, called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings, aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting, consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modular Embedding Recomposition for Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16463v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 36th British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC 2025), Sheffield, UK</p></details> |
| **[Resource-Constrained Federated Continual Learning: What Does Matter?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08737v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Continual Learning (FCL) aims to enable sequentially privacy-preserving model training on streams of incoming data that vary in edge devices by preserving previous knowledge while adapting to new data. Current FCL literature focuses on restricted data privacy and access to previously seen data while imposing no constraints on the training overhead. This is unreasonable for FCL applications in real-world scenarios, where edge devices are primarily constrained by resources such as storage, computational budget, and label rate. We revisit this problem with a large-scale benchmark and analyze the performance of state-of-the-art FCL approaches under different resource-constrained settings. Various typical FCL techniques and six datasets in two incremental learning scenarios (Class-IL and Domain-IL) are involved in our experiments. Through extensive experiments amounting to a total of over 1,000+ GPU hours, we find that, under limited resource-constrained settings, existing FCL approaches, with no exception, fail to achieve the expected performance. Our conclusions are consistent in the sensitivity analysis. This suggests that most existing FCL methods are particularly too resource-dependent for real-world deployment. Moreover, we study the performance of typical FCL techniques with resource constraints and shed light on future research directions in FCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.11165 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[DRL: Discriminative Representation Learning with Parallel Adapters for Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12107v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs), remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference phases.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Your VAR Model is Secretly an Efficient and Explainable Generative Classifier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12060v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gains: Fine-grained Federated Domain Adaptation in Open Set](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15967v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional federated learning (FL) assumes a closed world with a fixed total number of clients. In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL process in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two critical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and integrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing research focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices source domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a fine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains). Gains splits the model into an encoder and a classifier, empirically revealing features extracted by the encoder are sensitive to domain shifts while classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. Based on this, we develop fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation techniques to identify and incorporate new knowledge. Additionally, an anti-forgetting mechanism is designed to preserve source domain performance, ensuring balanced adaptation. Experimental results on multi-domain datasets across three typical data-shift scenarios demonstrate that Gains significantly outperforms other baselines in performance for both source-domain and target-domain clients.

| **[Continual Adapter Tuning with Semantic Shift Compensation for Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19979v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes while overcoming catastrophic forgetting. The introduction of pre-trained models has brought new tuning paradigms to CIL. In this paper, we revisit different parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods within the context of continual learning. We observe that adapter tuning demonstrates superiority over prompt-based methods, even without parameter expansion in each learning session. Motivated by this, we propose incrementally tuning the shared adapter without imposing parameter update constraints, enhancing the learning capacity of the backbone. Additionally, we employ feature sampling from stored prototypes to retrain a unified classifier, further improving its performance. We estimate the semantic shift of old prototypes without access to past samples and update stored prototypes session by session. Our proposed method eliminates model expansion and avoids retaining any image samples. It surpasses previous pre-trained model-based CIL methods and demonstrates remarkable continual learning capabilities. Experimental results on five CIL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal extension of SSIAT (CVPR 2024)</p></details> |
