| **[FC-KAN: Function Combinations in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01763v4)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce FC-KAN, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that leverages combinations of popular mathematical functions such as B-splines, wavelets, and radial basis functions on low-dimensional data through element-wise operations. We explore several methods for combining the outputs of these functions, including sum, element-wise product, the addition of sum and element-wise product, representations of quadratic and cubic functions, concatenation, linear transformation of the concatenated output, and others. In our experiments, we compare FC-KAN with a multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) and other existing KANs, such as BSRBF-KAN, EfficientKAN, FastKAN, and FasterKAN, on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Two variants of FC-KAN, which use a combination of outputs from B-splines and Difference of Gaussians (DoG) and from B-splines and linear transformations in the form of a quadratic function, outperformed overall other models on the average of 5 independent training runs. We expect that FC-KAN can leverage function combinations to design future KANs. Our repository is publicly available at: https://github.com/hoangthangta/FC_KAN.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[TCBench: A Benchmark for Tropical Cyclone Track and Intensity Forecasting at the Global Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23268v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>TCBench is a benchmark for evaluating global, short to medium-range (1-5 days) forecasts of tropical cyclone (TC) track and intensity. To allow a fair and model-agnostic comparison, TCBench builds on the IBTrACS observational dataset and formulates TC forecasting as predicting the time evolution of an existing tropical system conditioned on its initial position and intensity. TCBench includes state-of-the-art dynamical (TIGGE) and neural weather models (AIFS, Pangu-Weather, FourCastNet v2, GenCast). If not readily available, baseline tracks are consistently derived from model outputs using the TempestExtremes library. For evaluation, TCBench provides deterministic and probabilistic storm-following metrics. On 2023 test cases, neural weather models skillfully forecast TC tracks, while skillful intensity forecasts require additional steps such as post-processing. Designed for accessibility, TCBench helps AI practitioners tackle domain-relevant TC challenges and equips tropical meteorologists with data-driven tools and workflows to improve prediction and TC process understanding. By lowering barriers to reproducible, process-aware evaluation of extreme events, TCBench aims to democratize data-driven TC forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 Pa...</summary><p>28 Pages, Including SI</p></details> |
| **[Outcome-Conditioned Reasoning Distillation for Resolving Software Issues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23257v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software issue resolution in large repositories is a long-range decision process: choices made during localization shape the space of viable edits, and missteps can compound into incorrect patches. Despite this, many LLM-based repair pipelines still operate in a reset-and-solve manner, producing fresh reasoning for every new issue instead of carrying forward what worked in past fixes. This is wasteful because repositories routinely contain earlier issues with overlapping structure, failure modes, or constraints, where prior repair experience could provide useful guidance. Existing approaches typically harvest this signal through forward-time trial procedures, such as repeated refinement or search, incurring high inference cost while still risking divergence from the eventual correct patch. We present an Outcome-Conditioned Reasoning Distillation(O-CRD) framework that uses resolved in-repository issues with verified patches as supervision. Starting from a historical fix, the method reconstructs a stage-wise repair trace backward from the verified outcome, then reuses the distilled guidance at inference time to steer file/function localization and patch synthesis, without fine-tuning or online search. On SWE-Bench Lite, this approach increases Pass@1 by 10.4% with GPT-4o, 8.6% with DeepSeek-V3, and 10.3% with GPT-5, indicating that outcome-conditioned reuse of verified repairs can replace costly forward exploration for software issue resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards a Benchmark for Dependency Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00205v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding agents increasingly modify real software repositories and make dependency decisions, including adding, removing, or updating third-party packages. These choices can materially affect security posture and maintenance burden, yet repository-level evaluations largely emphasize test passing and executability without explicitly scoring whether systems (i) reuse existing dependencies, (ii) avoid unnecessary additions, or (iii) select versions that satisfy security and policy constraints. We propose DepDec-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating dependency decision-making beyond functional correctness. To ground DepDec-Bench in real-world behavior, we conduct a preliminary study of 117,062 dependency changes from agent- and human-authored pull requests across seven ecosystems. We show that coding agents frequently make dependency decisions with security consequences that remain invisible to test-focused evaluation: agents select PR-time known-vulnerable versions (2.46%) and exhibit net-negative security impact overall (net impact -98 vs. +1,316 for humans). These observations inform DepDec-Bench task families and metrics that evaluate safe version selection, reuse discipline, and restraint against dependency bloat alongside test passing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at JAWS 2026. 5 pages, 1 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

| **[Generative quantum machine learning via denoising diffusion probabilistic models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05866v5)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models are key-enabling technology to computer vision, text generation, and large language models. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently gained much attention due to their ability to generate diverse and high-quality samples in many computer vision tasks, as well as to incorporate flexible model architectures and a relatively simple training scheme. Quantum generative models, empowered by entanglement and superposition, have brought new insight to learning classical and quantum data. Inspired by the classical counterpart, we propose the quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model (QuDDPM) to enable efficiently trainable generative learning of quantum data. QuDDPM adopts sufficient layers of circuits to guarantee expressivity, while it introduces multiple intermediate training tasks as interpolation between the target distribution and noise to avoid barren plateau and guarantee efficient training. We provide bounds on the learning error and demonstrate QuDDPM's capability in learning correlated quantum noise model, quantum many-body phases, and topological structure of quantum data. The results provide a paradigm for versatile and efficient quantum generative learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+10 ...</summary><p>5+10 pages, 16 figures. PRL accepted version.

| **[Disentangling multispecific antibody function with graph neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23212v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multispecific antibodies offer transformative therapeutic potential by engaging multiple epitopes simultaneously, yet their efficacy is an emergent property governed by complex molecular architectures. Rational design is often bottlenecked by the inability to predict how subtle changes in domain topology influence functional outcomes, a challenge exacerbated by the scarcity of comprehensive experimental data. Here, we introduce a computational framework to address part of this gap. First, we present a generative method for creating large-scale, realistic synthetic functional landscapes that capture non-linear interactions where biological activity depends on domain connectivity. Second, we propose a graph neural network architecture that explicitly encodes these topological constraints, distinguishing between format configurations that appear identical to sequence-only models. We demonstrate that this model, trained on synthetic landscapes, recapitulates complex functional properties and, via transfer learning, has the potential to achieve high predictive accuracy on limited biological datasets. We showcase the model's utility by optimizing trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity in trispecific T-cell engagers and retrieving optimal common light chains. This work provides a robust benchmarking environment for disentangling the combinatorial complexity of multispecifics, accelerating the design of next-generation therapeutics.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, code available at https://github.com/prescient-design/synapse</p></details> |

We partially address this gap for node regression with graph-based errors-in-variables models under simultaneous covariate and edge corruption: responses are generated from latent node-level covariates, but only noise-perturbed versions of the latent covariates are observed; and the sample graph is a random geometric graph created from the node covariates but contaminated by independent Erdős--Rényi edges. We propose and analyze a carefully designed, task-specific GAT that constructs denoised proxy features for regression. We prove that regressing the response variables on the proxies achieves lower error asymptotically in (a) estimating the regression coefficient compared to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator on the noisy node covariates, and (b) predicting the response for an unlabelled node compared to a vanilla graph convolutional network~(GCN) -- under mild growth conditions. Our analysis leverages high-dimensional geometric tail bounds and concentration for neighbourhood counts and sample covariances. We verify our theoretical findings through experiments on synthetically generated data. We also perform experiments on real-world graphs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in several node regression tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

| **[Sequence Diffusion Model for Temporal Link Prediction in Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23233v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a fundamental problem in many real-world systems. Existing temporal graph neural networks mainly focus on learning representations of historical interactions. Despite their strong performance, these models are still purely discriminative, producing point estimates for future links and lacking an explicit mechanism to capture the uncertainty and sequential structure of future temporal interactions. In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on various temporal graph benchmarks show that SDG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the temporal link prediction task.</p></details> |  |

Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently gained much attention due to their ability to generate diverse and high-quality samples in many computer vision tasks, as well as to incorporate flexible model architectures and a relatively simple training scheme. Quantum generative models, empowered by entanglement and superposition, have brought new insight to learning classical and quantum data. Inspired by the classical counterpart, we propose the quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model (QuDDPM) to enable efficiently trainable generative learning of quantum data. QuDDPM adopts sufficient layers of circuits to guarantee expressivity, while it introduces multiple intermediate training tasks as interpolation between the target distribution and noise to avoid barren plateau and guarantee efficient training. We provide bounds on the learning error and demonstrate QuDDPM's capability in learning correlated quantum noise model, quantum many-body phases, and topological structure of quantum data. The results provide a paradigm for versatile and efficient quantum generative learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+10 ...</summary><p>5+10 pages, 16 figures. PRL accepted version.

Rational design is often bottlenecked by the inability to predict how subtle changes in domain topology influence functional outcomes, a challenge exacerbated by the scarcity of comprehensive experimental data. Here, we introduce a computational framework to address part of this gap. First, we present a generative method for creating large-scale, realistic synthetic functional landscapes that capture non-linear interactions where biological activity depends on domain connectivity. Second, we propose a graph neural network architecture that explicitly encodes these topological constraints, distinguishing between format configurations that appear identical to sequence-only models. We demonstrate that this model, trained on synthetic landscapes, recapitulates complex functional properties and, via transfer learning, has the potential to achieve high predictive accuracy on limited biological datasets. We showcase the model's utility by optimizing trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity in trispecific T-cell engagers and retrieving optimal common light chains. This work provides a robust benchmarking environment for disentangling the combinatorial complexity of multispecifics, accelerating the design of next-generation therapeutics.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, code available at https://github.com/prescient-design/synapse</p></details> |

We hypothesize that these failures arise because standard denoising objectives lack explicit incentives for geometric coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoGPA (Video Geometric Preference Alignment), a data-efficient self-supervised framework that leverages a geometry foundation model to automatically derive dense preference signals that guide VDMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This approach effectively steers the generative distribution toward inherent 3D consistency without requiring human annotations. VideoGPA significantly enhances temporal stability, physical plausibility, and motion coherence using minimal preference pairs, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |

Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the coefficient prior, while a neural operator explicitly models the forward PDE for guidance. This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce. Empirically, DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse observation, improving $l_2$ error by 11% and spectral error by 54% on average; when data is limited to 1%, DDIS maintains accuracy with 40% advantage in $l_2$ error compared to joint models.</p></details> |  |
| **[FOCUS: DLLMs Know How to Tame Their Compute Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23278v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) offer a compelling alternative to Auto-Regressive models, but their deployment is constrained by high decoding cost. In this work, we identify a key inefficiency in DLLM decoding: while computation is parallelized over token blocks, only a small subset of tokens is decodable at each diffusion step, causing most compute to be wasted on non-decodable tokens. We further observe a strong correlation between attention-derived token importance and token-wise decoding probability. Based on this insight, we propose FOCUS -- an inference system designed for DLLMs. By dynamically focusing computation on decodable tokens and evicting non-decodable ones on-the-fly, FOCUS increases the effective batch size, alleviating compute limitations and enabling scalable throughput. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FOCUS achieves up to 3.52$\times$ throughput improvement over the production-grade engine LMDeploy, while preserving or improving generation quality across multiple benchmarks. The FOCUS system is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/sands-lab/FOCUS.</p></details> | 22 pages, 15 figures |

We argue that requirements of effective coordination are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However, prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and $34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and computational cost, specifically achieving about $\boldsymbol{\times14.5}$ faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

We explore several methods for combining the outputs of these functions, including sum, element-wise product, the addition of sum and element-wise product, representations of quadratic and cubic functions, concatenation, linear transformation of the concatenated output, and others. In our experiments, we compare FC-KAN with a multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) and other existing KANs, such as BSRBF-KAN, EfficientKAN, FastKAN, and FasterKAN, on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Two variants of FC-KAN, which use a combination of outputs from B-splines and Difference of Gaussians (DoG) and from B-splines and linear transformations in the form of a quadratic function, outperformed overall other models on the average of 5 independent training runs. We expect that FC-KAN can leverage function combinations to design future KANs. Our repository is publicly available at: https://github.com/hoangthangta/FC_KAN.</p></details> | 17 pages |

In this paper, we ask: \textit{what} is this information? We find that, in pixel-space diffusion models, (1) a large fraction of the total information in the neural network is committed to reconstructing small-scale perceptual details of the image, and (2) the correlations between images and their class labels are informed by the semantic content of the images, and are largely agnostic to the low-level details. We argue that these properties are intrinsically tied to the manifold structure of the data itself. Finally, we show that these facts explain the efficacy of classifier-free guidance: the guidance vector amplifies the mutual information between images and conditioning signals early in the generative process, influencing semantic structure, but tapers out as perceptual details are filled in.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages + references, 19 figures. v4: Re-organized the paper to focus on separability of information</p></details> |

To allow a fair and model-agnostic comparison, TCBench builds on the IBTrACS observational dataset and formulates TC forecasting as predicting the time evolution of an existing tropical system conditioned on its initial position and intensity. TCBench includes state-of-the-art dynamical (TIGGE) and neural weather models (AIFS, Pangu-Weather, FourCastNet v2, GenCast). If not readily available, baseline tracks are consistently derived from model outputs using the TempestExtremes library. For evaluation, TCBench provides deterministic and probabilistic storm-following metrics. On 2023 test cases, neural weather models skillfully forecast TC tracks, while skillful intensity forecasts require additional steps such as post-processing. Designed for accessibility, TCBench helps AI practitioners tackle domain-relevant TC challenges and equips tropical meteorologists with data-driven tools and workflows to improve prediction and TC process understanding. By lowering barriers to reproducible, process-aware evaluation of extreme events, TCBench aims to democratize data-driven TC forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 Pa...</summary><p>28 Pages, Including SI</p></details> |

Training begins with imitation from an expert finite state machine (FSM) controller to provide a stable initialization. Environment terms are combined with an IRL discriminator signal to align with expert goals. Reinforcement learning (RL) is then performed with a hybrid reward that combines diffuse environmental feedback and targeted IRL rewards. A conditional diffusion model, which acts as a safety supervisor, plans safe paths. It stays in its lane, avoids obstacles, and moves smoothly. Then, a learnable adaptive mask (LAM) improves perception. It shifts visual attention based on vehicle speed and nearby hazards. After FSM-based imitation, the policy is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Training is run in the Webots simulator with a two-stage curriculum. A 96\% success rate is reached, and collisions are reduced to 0.05 per 1k steps, marking a new benchmark for safe navigation. By applying the proposed approach, the agent not only drives in lane but also handles unsafe conditions at an expert level, increasing robustness.We make our code publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, many LLM-based repair pipelines still operate in a reset-and-solve manner, producing fresh reasoning for every new issue instead of carrying forward what worked in past fixes. This is wasteful because repositories routinely contain earlier issues with overlapping structure, failure modes, or constraints, where prior repair experience could provide useful guidance. Existing approaches typically harvest this signal through forward-time trial procedures, such as repeated refinement or search, incurring high inference cost while still risking divergence from the eventual correct patch. We present an Outcome-Conditioned Reasoning Distillation(O-CRD) framework that uses resolved in-repository issues with verified patches as supervision. Starting from a historical fix, the method reconstructs a stage-wise repair trace backward from the verified outcome, then reuses the distilled guidance at inference time to steer file/function localization and patch synthesis, without fine-tuning or online search. On SWE-Bench Lite, this approach increases Pass@1 by 10.4% with GPT-4o, 8.6% with DeepSeek-V3, and 10.3% with GPT-5, indicating that outcome-conditioned reuse of verified repairs can replace costly forward exploration for software issue resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion-based Frameworks for Unsupervised Speech Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09931v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses unsupervised diffusion-based single-channel speech enhancement (SE). Prior work in this direction combines a score-based diffusion model trained on clean speech with a Gaussian noise model whose covariance is structured by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). This combination is used within an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) scheme, in which a diffusion-based posterior-sampling E-step estimates the clean speech. We first revisit this framework and propose to explicitly model both speech and acoustic noise as latent variables, jointly sampling them in the E-step instead of sampling speech alone as in previous approaches. We then introduce a new unsupervised SE framework that replaces the NMF noise prior with a diffusion-based noise model, learned jointly with the speech prior in a single conditional score model. Within this framework, we derive two variants: one that implicitly accounts for noise and one that explicitly treats noise as a latent variable. Experiments on WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND show that explicit noise modeling systematically improves SE performance for both NMF-based and diffusion-based noise priors. Under matched conditions, the diffusion-based noise model attains the best overall quality and intelligibility among unsupervised methods, while under mismatched conditions the proposed NMF-based explicit-noise framework is more robust and suffers less degradation than several supervised baselines.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce a computational framework to address part of this gap. First, we present a generative method for creating large-scale, realistic synthetic functional landscapes that capture non-linear interactions where biological activity depends on domain connectivity. Second, we propose a graph neural network architecture that explicitly encodes these topological constraints, distinguishing between format configurations that appear identical to sequence-only models. We demonstrate that this model, trained on synthetic landscapes, recapitulates complex functional properties and, via transfer learning, has the potential to achieve high predictive accuracy on limited biological datasets. We showcase the model's utility by optimizing trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity in trispecific T-cell engagers and retrieving optimal common light chains.

We explore several methods for combining the outputs of these functions, including sum, element-wise product, the addition of sum and element-wise product, representations of quadratic and cubic functions, concatenation, linear transformation of the concatenated output, and others. In our experiments, we compare FC-KAN with a multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) and other existing KANs, such as BSRBF-KAN, EfficientKAN, FastKAN, and FasterKAN, on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Two variants of FC-KAN, which use a combination of outputs from B-splines and Difference of Gaussians (DoG) and from B-splines and linear transformations in the form of a quadratic function, outperformed overall other models on the average of 5 independent training runs. We expect that FC-KAN can leverage function combinations to design future KANs. Our repository is publicly available at: https://github.com/hoangthangta/FC_KAN.</p></details> | 17 pages |

To allow a fair and model-agnostic comparison, TCBench builds on the IBTrACS observational dataset and formulates TC forecasting as predicting the time evolution of an existing tropical system conditioned on its initial position and intensity. TCBench includes state-of-the-art dynamical (TIGGE) and neural weather models (AIFS, Pangu-Weather, FourCastNet v2, GenCast). If not readily available, baseline tracks are consistently derived from model outputs using the TempestExtremes library. For evaluation, TCBench provides deterministic and probabilistic storm-following metrics. On 2023 test cases, neural weather models skillfully forecast TC tracks, while skillful intensity forecasts require additional steps such as post-processing. Designed for accessibility, TCBench helps AI practitioners tackle domain-relevant TC challenges and equips tropical meteorologists with data-driven tools and workflows to improve prediction and TC process understanding. By lowering barriers to reproducible, process-aware evaluation of extreme events, TCBench aims to democratize data-driven TC forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 Pa...</summary><p>28 Pages, Including SI</p></details> |

On SWE-Bench Lite, this approach increases Pass@1 by 10.4% with GPT-4o, 8.6% with DeepSeek-V3, and 10.3% with GPT-5, indicating that outcome-conditioned reuse of verified repairs can replace costly forward exploration for software issue resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards a Benchmark for Dependency Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00205v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding agents increasingly modify real software repositories and make dependency decisions, including adding, removing, or updating third-party packages. These choices can materially affect security posture and maintenance burden, yet repository-level evaluations largely emphasize test passing and executability without explicitly scoring whether systems (i) reuse existing dependencies, (ii) avoid unnecessary additions, or (iii) select versions that satisfy security and policy constraints. We propose DepDec-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating dependency decision-making beyond functional correctness. To ground DepDec-Bench in real-world behavior, we conduct a preliminary study of 117,062 dependency changes from agent- and human-authored pull requests across seven ecosystems. We show that coding agents frequently make dependency decisions with security consequences that remain invisible to test-focused evaluation: agents select PR-time known-vulnerable versions (2.46%) and exhibit net-negative security impact overall (net impact -98 vs. +1,316 for humans). These observations inform DepDec-Bench task families and metrics that evaluate safe version selection, reuse discipline, and restraint against dependency bloat alongside test passing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at JAWS 2026. 5 pages, 1 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

A benchmark study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23238v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative learning generates high dimensional data based on low dimensional conditions, also called prompts. Therefore, generative learning algorithms are eligible for solving (Bayesian) inverse problems. In this article we compare a traditional Bayesian inverse approach based on a forward regression model and a prior sampled with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with three state of the art generative learning models, namely conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, Invertible Neural Networks and Conditional Flow Matching. We apply them to a problem of gas turbine combustor design where we map six independent design parameters to three performance labels. We propose several metrics for the evaluation of this inverse design approaches and measure the accuracy of the labels of the generated designs along with the diversity. We also study the performance as a function of the training dataset size. Our benchmark has a clear winner, as Conditional Flow Matching consistently outperforms all competing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Just as Humans Need Vaccines, So Do Models: Model Immunization to Combat Falsehoods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17870v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) reproduce misinformation by learning the linguistic patterns that make falsehoods persuasive, such as hedging, false presuppositions, and citation fabrication, rather than merely memorizing false facts. We propose model immunization: supervised fine-tuning on curated (false claim, correction) pairs injected as small "vaccine doses" (5-10\% of tokens) alongside truthful data. Unlike post-hoc filtering or preference-based alignment, immunization provides direct negative supervision on labeled falsehoods. Across four open-weight model families, immunization improves TruthfulQA accuracy by 12 points and misinformation rejection by 30 points with negligible capability loss. We outline design requirements, which includes, dosage, labeling, quarantine, diversity and call for standardized vaccine corpora and benchmarks that test generalization, making immunization a routine component of responsible LLM development</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative quantum machine learning via denoising diffusion probabilistic models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05866v5)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models are key-enabling technology to computer vision, text generation, and large language models. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently gained much attention due to their ability to generate diverse and high-quality samples in many computer vision tasks, as well as to incorporate flexible model architectures and a relatively simple training scheme. Quantum generative models, empowered by entanglement and superposition, have brought new insight to learning classical and quantum data. Inspired by the classical counterpart, we propose the quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model (QuDDPM) to enable efficiently trainable generative learning of quantum data. QuDDPM adopts sufficient layers of circuits to guarantee expressivity, while it introduces multiple intermediate training tasks as interpolation between the target distribution and noise to avoid barren plateau and guarantee efficient training. We provide bounds on the learning error and demonstrate QuDDPM's capability in learning correlated quantum noise model, quantum many-body phases, and topological structure of quantum data. The results provide a paradigm for versatile and efficient quantum generative learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+10 ...</summary><p>5+10 pages, 16 figures. PRL accepted version.

| **[Disentangling multispecific antibody function with graph neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23212v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multispecific antibodies offer transformative therapeutic potential by engaging multiple epitopes simultaneously, yet their efficacy is an emergent property governed by complex molecular architectures. Rational design is often bottlenecked by the inability to predict how subtle changes in domain topology influence functional outcomes, a challenge exacerbated by the scarcity of comprehensive experimental data. Here, we introduce a computational framework to address part of this gap. First, we present a generative method for creating large-scale, realistic synthetic functional landscapes that capture non-linear interactions where biological activity depends on domain connectivity. Second, we propose a graph neural network architecture that explicitly encodes these topological constraints, distinguishing between format configurations that appear identical to sequence-only models. We demonstrate that this model, trained on synthetic landscapes, recapitulates complex functional properties and, via transfer learning, has the potential to achieve high predictive accuracy on limited biological datasets. We showcase the model's utility by optimizing trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity in trispecific T-cell engagers and retrieving optimal common light chains. This work provides a robust benchmarking environment for disentangling the combinatorial complexity of multispecifics, accelerating the design of next-generation therapeutics.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, code available at https://github.com/prescient-design/synapse</p></details> |
