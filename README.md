Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context. While natural speech might unfold gradually over minutes, most methods pre-train with only a few seconds of context. Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding. Our results indicate that long-context pre-training helps exploit extended neural context that other methods unnecessarily discard.

We introduce Advisor Models, a method to train small open-weight models to generate dynamic, per-instance natural language advice that improves the capabilities of black-box frontier models. Advisor Models improve GPT-5's performance on RuleArena (Taxes) by 71%, reduce Gemini 3 Pro's steps taken in SWE agent tasks by 24.6%, and outperform static prompt optimizers in personalizing GPT-5 to user preferences (85-100% vs. 40-60%). We also find that advisors are transferable: an advisor trained with a low-cost student model still transfers improvements to a frontier model. Moreover, Advisor Models are robust: we observe no degradation on other benchmarks than the pipeline is trained on. Our method shows how to perform parametric optimization for black-box frontier models in a practical and cost-effective way.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confounder-robust causal discovery and inference in Perturb-seq using proxy and instrumental variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01830v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging single-cell technologies that integrate CRISPR-based genetic perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing, such as Perturb-seq, have substantially advanced our understanding of gene regulation and causal influence of genes. While Perturb-seq data provide valuable causal insights into gene-gene interactions, statistical concerns remain regarding unobserved confounders that may bias inference. These latent factors may arise not only from intrinsic molecular features of regulatory elements encoded in Perturb-seq experiments, but also from unobserved genes arising from cost-constrained experimental designs. Although methods for analyzing large-scale Perturb-seq data are rapidly maturing, approaches that explicitly account for such unobserved confounders in learning the causal gene networks are still lacking. Here, we propose a novel method to recover causal gene networks from Perturb-seq experiments with robustness to arbitrarily omitted confounders. Our framework leverages proxy and instrumental variable strategies to exploit the rich information embedded in perturbations, enabling unbiased estimation of the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) of gene expressions. Simulation studies and analyses of CRISPR interference experiments of K562 cells demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches that ignore unmeasured confounding, yielding more accurate and biologically relevant recovery of the true gene causal DAGs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Image Generation via Human-in-the-loop Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02388v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine Alice has a specific image $x^\ast$ in her mind, say, the view of the street in which she grew up during her childhood. To generate that exact image, she guides a generative model with multiple rounds of prompting and arrives at an image $x^{p*}$. Although $x^{p*}$ is reasonably close to $x^\ast$, Alice finds it difficult to close that gap using language prompts. This paper aims to narrow this gap by observing that even after language has reached its limits, humans can still tell when a new image $x^+$ is closer to $x^\ast$ than $x^{p*}$. Leveraging this observation, we develop MultiBO (Multi-Choice Preferential Bayesian Optimization) that carefully generates $K$ new images as a function of $x^{p*}$, gets preferential feedback from the user, uses the feedback to guide the diffusion model, and ultimately generates a new set of $K$ images. We show that within $B$ rounds of user feedback, it is possible to arrive much closer to $x^\ast$, even though the generative model has no information about $x^\ast$. Qualitative scores from $30$ users, combined with quantitative metrics compared across $5$ baselines, show promising results, suggesting that multi-choice feedback from humans can be effectively harnessed for personalized image generation.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate agents' performance along three task-aware dimensions spanning the PR lifecycle: (1) PR acceptance rate, (2) review discussion volume, and (3) commit message quality. Our quantitative analysis finds that Codex consistently achieves high PR acceptance rates across most task categories, while Copilot's PRs trigger the highest volume of both human and automated review discussions. In contrast, commit-level quality varies independently of acceptance outcomes. Claude and Cursor produce higher proportions of high-quality commit messages across several task types, and Codex exhibiting comparatively lower commit quality despite strong integration outcomes. Our findings inform selection and improvements of AI agents for their effective integration to collaborative software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, accepted at MSR Mining Challenge 2026</p></details> |

However, for LLMs, full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformers. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem: finding a pruning mask that minimizes per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches rely on approximations or heuristics. We demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) computable efficiently via the Gram matrix. We propose a simple 1-swap algorithm that warmstarts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free. Our approach reduces per-layer pruning error by up to 60% over Wanda (Sun et al., 2024) and consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across state-of-the-art GPT architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, it is challenging to optimize high-dimensional pixel manifolds that contain many perceptually irrelevant signals, leaving existing pixel diffusion methods lagging behind latent diffusion models. We propose PixelGen, a simple pixel diffusion framework with perceptual supervision. Instead of modeling the full image manifold, PixelGen introduces two complementary perceptual losses to guide diffusion model towards learning a more meaningful perceptual manifold. An LPIPS loss facilitates learning better local patterns, while a DINO-based perceptual loss strengthens global semantics. With perceptual supervision, PixelGen surpasses strong latent diffusion baselines. It achieves an FID of 5.11 on ImageNet-256 without classifier-free guidance using only 80 training epochs, and demonstrates favorable scaling performance on large-scale text-to-image generation with a GenEval score of 0.79. PixelGen requires no VAEs, no latent representations, and no auxiliary stages, providing a simpler yet more powerful generative paradigm.

We study a hybrid perspective: \emph{trust region continual learning} that combines generative replay with a Fisher-metric trust region constraint. We show that, under local approximations, the resulting update admits a MAML-style interpretation with a single implicit inner step: replay supplies an old-task gradient signal (query-like), while the Fisher-weighted penalty provides an efficient offline curvature shaping (support-like). This yields an emergent meta-learning property in continual learning: the model becomes an initialization that rapidly \emph{re-converges} to prior task optima after each task transition, without explicitly optimizing a bilevel objective. Empirically, on task-incremental diffusion image generation and continual diffusion-policy control, trust region continual learning achieves the best final performance and retention, and consistently recovers early-task performance faster than EWC, replay, and continual meta-learning baselines.</p></details> | 19 pages, 23 tables |

Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality. The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together, these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and corresponding latency/throughput gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[PRISM: Performer RS-IMLE for Single-pass Multisensory Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02396v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic imitation learning typically requires models that capture multimodal action distributions while operating at real-time control rates and accommodating multiple sensing modalities. Although recent generative approaches such as diffusion models, flow matching, and Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) have achieved promising results, they often satisfy only a subset of these requirements. To address this, we introduce PRISM, a single-pass policy based on a batch-global rejection-sampling variant of IMLE. PRISM couples a temporal multisensory encoder (integrating RGB, depth, tactile, audio, and proprioception) with a linear-attention generator using a Performer architecture. We demonstrate the efficacy of PRISM on a diverse real-world hardware suite, including loco-manipulation using a Unitree Go2 with a 7-DoF arm D1 and tabletop manipulation with a UR5 manipulator. Across challenging physical tasks such as pre-manipulation parking, high-precision insertion, and multi-object pick-and-place, PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies by 10-25% in success rate while maintaining high-frequency (30-50 Hz) closed-loop control. We further validate our approach on large-scale simulation benchmarks, including CALVIN, MetaWorld, and Robomimic. In CALVIN (10% data split), PRISM improves success rates by approximately 25% over diffusion and approximately 20% over flow matching, while simultaneously reducing trajectory jerk by 20x-50x. These results position PRISM as a fast, accurate, and multisensory imitation policy that retains multimodal action coverage without the latency of iterative sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text and 4 figures, and 11 pages appendix and 10 figures, total 21 pages and 14 figures</p></details> |

To generate that exact image, she guides a generative model with multiple rounds of prompting and arrives at an image $x^{p*}$. Although $x^{p*}$ is reasonably close to $x^\ast$, Alice finds it difficult to close that gap using language prompts. This paper aims to narrow this gap by observing that even after language has reached its limits, humans can still tell when a new image $x^+$ is closer to $x^\ast$ than $x^{p*}$. Leveraging this observation, we develop MultiBO (Multi-Choice Preferential Bayesian Optimization) that carefully generates $K$ new images as a function of $x^{p*}$, gets preferential feedback from the user, uses the feedback to guide the diffusion model, and ultimately generates a new set of $K$ images. We show that within $B$ rounds of user feedback, it is possible to arrive much closer to $x^\ast$, even though the generative model has no information about $x^\ast$. Qualitative scores from $30$ users, combined with quantitative metrics compared across $5$ baselines, show promising results, suggesting that multi-choice feedback from humans can be effectively harnessed for personalized image generation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Secure Multi-User Linearly-Separable Distributed Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02489v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of the new multi-user linearly-separable distributed computing framework, has recently revealed how a parallel treatment of users can yield large parallelization gains with relatively low computation and communication costs. These gains stem from a new approach that converts the computing problem into a sparse matrix factorization problem; a matrix $F$ that describes the users' requests, is decomposed as \(F = DE\), where a \(γ\)-sparse \(E\) defines the task allocation across $N$ servers, and a \(δ\)-sparse \(D\) defines the connectivity between \(N\) servers and \(K\) users as well as the decoding process. While this approach provides near-optimal performance, its linear nature has raised data secrecy concerns. We here adopt an information-theoretic secrecy framework, seeking guarantees that each user can learn nothing more than its own requested function. In this context, our main result provides two necessary and sufficient secrecy criteria; (i) for each user \(k\) who observes $α_k$ server responses, the common randomness visible to that user must span a subspace of dimension exactly $α_k-1$, and (ii) for each user, removing from \(\mathbf{D}\) the columns corresponding to the servers it observes must leave a matrix of rank at least \(K-1\). With these conditions in place, we design a general scheme -- that applies to finite and non-finite fields alike -- which is based on appending to \(\mathbf{E}\) a basis of \(\mathrm{Null}(\mathbf{D})\) and by carefully injecting shared randomness. In many cases, this entails no additional costs. The scheme, while maintaining performance, guarantees perfect information-theoretic secrecy in the case of finite fields, while in the real case, the conditions yield an explicit mutual-information bound that can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the variance of Gaussian common randomness.</p></details> |  |

We focus on improving performance at the cell edge, where the 5G standard specifies a suite of LDPC codes with different rates that are applied to 4-QAM. We employ the method of shaping on rings which adds to the transmission rate as it shapes the input distribution. We double the size of the $4$-QAM constellation by introducing a second shell of signal points, and we implement non-equiprobable signaling through a shaping code which selects the high energy shell less frequently than the low energy shell. We describe how to combine coding and shaping by integrating shaping into the calculation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) necessary for decoding LDPC codes. We employ rate $1/2$ LDPC coding and select the rate of the shaping code to match that of rate $3/4$ LDPC coding using $4$-QAM. We present simulation results for a representative Veh-A channel showing gains of $4$ dB at a bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-3}$. When we choose an LDPC code from the 5G suite to match the BER performance of rate $1/2$ LDPC coding with shaping we show that transmission rate can be improved by $20 $%.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures.

We introduce BELLA (Budget-Efficient LLM Selection via Automated skill-profiling), a framework that recommends optimal LLM selection for tasks through interpretable skill-based model selection. Standard benchmarks report aggregate metrics that obscure which specific capabilities a task requires and whether a cheaper model could suffice. BELLA addresses this gap through three stages: (1) decomposing LLM outputs and extract the granular skills required by using critic-based profiling, (2) clustering skills into structured capability matrices, and (3) multi-objective optimization to select the right models to maximize performance while respecting budget constraints. BELLA provides natural-language rationale for recommendations, providing transparency that current black-box routing systems lack. We describe the framework architecture, situate it within the landscape of LLM routing and evaluation, and discuss its application to financial reasoning as a representative domain exhibiting diverse skill requirements and cost-variation across models. Our framework enables practitioners to make principled and cost-performance trade-offs for deploying LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared at MLSys YPS 2025</p></details> |

Traditional approaches such as random sampling, greedy information maximization, and round-robin coverage treat each decision in isolation, unable to learn adaptive strategies from experience. We propose Active Causal Experimentalist (ACE), which learns experimental design as a sequential policy. Our key insight is that while absolute information gains diminish as knowledge accumulates (making value-based RL unstable), relative comparisons between candidate interventions remain meaningful throughout. ACE exploits this via Direct Preference Optimization, learning from pairwise intervention comparisons rather than non-stationary reward magnitudes. Across synthetic benchmarks, physics simulations, and economic data, ACE achieves 70-71% improvement over baselines at equal intervention budgets (p < 0.001, Cohen's d ~ 2).

This suggests preference-based learning can recover principled experimental strategies, complementing theory with learned domain adaptation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Advisor Models improve GPT-5's performance on RuleArena (Taxes) by 71%, reduce Gemini 3 Pro's steps taken in SWE agent tasks by 24.6%, and outperform static prompt optimizers in personalizing GPT-5 to user preferences (85-100% vs. 40-60%).

To generate that exact image, she guides a generative model with multiple rounds of prompting and arrives at an image $x^{p*}$. Although $x^{p*}$ is reasonably close to $x^\ast$, Alice finds it difficult to close that gap using language prompts. This paper aims to narrow this gap by observing that even after language has reached its limits, humans can still tell when a new image $x^+$ is closer to $x^\ast$ than $x^{p*}$. Leveraging this observation, we develop MultiBO (Multi-Choice Preferential Bayesian Optimization) that carefully generates $K$ new images as a function of $x^{p*}$, gets preferential feedback from the user, uses the feedback to guide the diffusion model, and ultimately generates a new set of $K$ images. We show that within $B$ rounds of user feedback, it is possible to arrive much closer to $x^\ast$, even though the generative model has no information about $x^\ast$. Qualitative scores from $30$ users, combined with quantitative metrics compared across $5$ baselines, show promising results, suggesting that multi-choice feedback from humans can be effectively harnessed for personalized image generation.</p></details> |  |

Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context. While natural speech might unfold gradually over minutes, most methods pre-train with only a few seconds of context. Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding. Our results indicate that long-context pre-training helps exploit extended neural context that other methods unnecessarily discard.
