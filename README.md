However, their massive scale, often billions of parameters, poses significant challenges for real-time deployment, as inference becomes computationally expensive and latency-sensitive in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose Token Expand-and-Merge-VLA (TEAM-VLA), a training-free token compression framework that accelerates VLA inference while preserving task performance. TEAM-VLA introduces a dynamic token expansion mechanism that identifies and samples additional informative tokens in the spatial vicinity of attention-highlighted regions, enhancing contextual completeness. These expanded tokens are then selectively merged in deeper layers under action-aware guidance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic coherence. By coupling expansion and merging within a single feed-forward pass, TEAM-VLA achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, without any retraining or parameter updates. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TEAM-VLA consistently improves inference speed while maintaining or even surpassing the task success rate of full VLA models.

Boltzmann Generators tackle this problem by pairing a generative model, capable of exact likelihood computation, with importance sampling to obtain consistent samples under the target distribution. Current Boltzmann Generators primarily use continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) trained with flow matching for efficient training of powerful models. However, likelihood calculation for these models is extremely costly, requiring thousands of function evaluations per sample, severely limiting their adoption. In this work, we propose Few-step Accurate Likelihoods for Continuous Flows (FALCON), a method which allows for few-step sampling with a likelihood accurate enough for importance sampling applications by introducing a hybrid training objective that encourages invertibility. We show FALCON outperforms state-of-the-art normalizing flow models for molecular Boltzmann sampling and is two orders of magnitude faster than the equivalently performing CNF model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; NeurIPS 2025 MLSB</p></details> |
| **[Imitative Membership Inference Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06796v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a target machine learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific query instances were part of the training set. State-of-the-art MIAs rely on training hundreds of shadow models that are independent of the target model, leading to significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Imitative Membership Inference Attack (IMIA), which employs a novel imitative training technique to strategically construct a small number of target-informed imitative models that closely replicate the target model's behavior for inference. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IMIA substantially outperforms existing MIAs in various attack settings while only requiring less than 5% of the computational cost of state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/zealscott/IMIA</p></details> |

Recent advances in shortest path-biased BP routing (SP-BP) mitigate shortcomings such as slow startup and random walks, yet exclusive link-level commodity selection still causes last-packet problem and bandwidth underutilization. By revisiting the Lyapunov drift theory underlying BP, we show that the legacy exclusive commodity selection is unnecessary, and propose a Maximum Utility (MaxU) link-sharing method to expand its performance envelope without increasing control message overhead.

| **[FlipLLM: Efficient Bit-Flip Attacks on Multimodal LLMs using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09872v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision Models (VLMs), exhibit state-of-the-art performance but remain vulnerable to hardware-based threats, specifically bit-flip attacks (BFAs). Existing BFA discovery methods lack generalizability and struggle to scale, often failing to analyze the vast parameter space and complex interdependencies of modern foundation models in a reasonable time. This paper proposes FlipLLM, a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture-agnostic framework that formulates BFA discovery as a sequential decision-making problem. FlipLLM combines sensitivity-guided layer pruning with Q-learning to efficiently identify minimal, high-impact bit sets that can induce catastrophic failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of FlipLLM by applying it to a diverse set of models, including prominent text-only LLMs (GPT-2 Large, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and DeepSeek-V2 7B), VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6, and datasets, such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, VQAv2, and TextVQA. Our results show that FlipLLM can identify critical bits that are vulnerable to BFAs up to 2.5x faster than SOTA methods. We demonstrate that flipping the FlipLLM-identified bits plummets the accuracy of LLaMA 3.1 8B from 69.9% to ~0.2%, and for LLaVA's VQA score from 78% to almost 0%, by flipping as few as 5 and 7 bits, respectively. Further analysis reveals that applying standard hardware protection mechanisms, such as ECC SECDED, to the FlipLLM-identified bit locations completely mitigates the BFA impact, demonstrating the practical value of our framework in guiding hardware-level defenses. FlipLLM offers the first scalable and adaptive methodology for exploring the BFA vulnerability of both language and multimodal foundation models, paving the way for comprehensive hardware-security evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE HOST 2026</p></details> |
| **[True Random Number Generators on IQM Spark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09862v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random number generation is fundamental for many modern applications including cryptography, simulations and machine learning. Traditional pseudo-random numbers may offer statistical unpredictability, but are ultimately deterministic. On the other hand, True Random Number Generation (TRNG) offers true randomness. One way of obtaining such randomness are quantum systems, including quantum computers. As such the use of quantum computers for TRNG has received considerable attention in recent years. However, existing studies almost exclusively consider IBM quantum computers, often stop at using simulations and usually test only a handful of different TRNG quantum circuits. In this paper, we address those issues by presenting a study of TRNG circuits on Odra 5 a real-life quantum computer installed at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. It is also the first study to utilize the IQM superconducting architecture. Since Odra 5 is available on-premises it allows for much more comprehensive study of various TRNG circuits. In particular, we consider 5 types of TRNG circuits with 105 circuit subvariants in total. Each circuit is used to generate 1 million bits. We then perform an analysis of the quality of the obtained random sequences using the NIST SP 800-22 and NIST SP 800-90B test suites. We also provide a comprehensive review of existing literature on quantum computer-based TRNGs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Colouring Graphs Without a Subdivided H-Graph: A Full Complexity Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09859v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider Colouring on graphs that are $H$-subgraph-free for some fixed graph $H$, i.e., graphs that do not contain $H$ as a subgraph. It is known that even $3$-Colouring is NP-complete for $H$-subgraph-free graphs whenever $H$ has a cycle; or a vertex of degree at least $5$; or a component with two vertices of degree $4$, while Colouring is polynomial-time solvable for $H$-subgraph-free graphs if $H$ is a forest of maximum degree at most $3$, in which each component has at most one vertex of degree $3$. For connected graphs $H$, this means that it remains to consider when $H$ is tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$. We let $H$ be a so-called subdivided "H"-graph, which is either a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_0$: a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and no vertices of degree $3$, or a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_1$: a tree of maximum degree $3$ with exactly two vertices of degree $3$. In the literature, only a limited number of polynomial-time and NP-completeness results for these cases are known. We develop new polynomial-time techniques that allow us to determine the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs for all the remaining subdivided "H"-graphs, so we fully classify both cases. As a consequence, the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs has now been settled for all connected graphs $H$ except when $H$ is a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and at least one vertex of degree $3$; or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least three vertices of degree $3$. We also employ our new techniques to obtain the same new polynomial-time results for another classic graph problem, namely Stable Cut.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modality-Specific Enhancement and Complementary Fusion for Semi-Supervised Multi-Modal Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09801v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has become a promising direction for medical image segmentation, enabling models to learn from limited labeled data alongside abundant unlabeled samples. However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary effects of our proposed MEM and CIF in bridging cross-modality discrepancies and improving segmentation robustness under scarce supervision.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

Wallets, typically categorized as hot and cold, offer varying degrees of security and convenience. However, they are generally software-based applications running on microcontrollers. Consequently, they are vulnerable to malware and side-channel attacks, allowing perpetrators to extract private keys by targeting critical algorithms, such as ECC, which processes private keys to generate public keys and authorize transactions. To address these issues, this work presents EthVault, the first hardware architecture for an Ethereum hierarchically deterministic cold wallet, featuring hardware implementations of key algorithms for secure key generation. Also, an ECC architecture resilient to side-channel and timing attacks is proposed. Moreover, an architecture of the child key derivation function, a fundamental component of cryptocurrency wallets, is proposed. The design minimizes resource usage, meeting market demand for small, portable cryptocurrency wallets. FPGA implementation results validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The ECC architecture exhibits uniform execution behavior across varying inputs, while the complete design utilizes only 27%, 7%, and 6% of LUTs, registers, and RAM blocks, respectively, on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IET Blockchain</p></details> |
| **[Physics-Aware Heterogeneous GNN Architecture for Real-Time BESS Optimization in Unbalanced Distribution Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09780v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Battery energy storage systems (BESS) have become increasingly vital in three-phase unbalanced distribution grids for maintaining voltage stability and enabling optimal dispatch. However, existing deep learning approaches often lack explicit three-phase representation, making it difficult to accurately model phase-specific dynamics and enforce operational constraints--leading to infeasible dispatch solutions. This paper demonstrates that by embedding detailed three-phase grid information--including phase voltages, unbalanced loads, and BESS states--into heterogeneous graph nodes, diverse GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GPS) can jointly predict network state variables with high accuracy. Moreover, a physics-informed loss function incorporates critical battery constraints--SoC and C-rate limits--via soft penalties during training. Experimental validation on the CIGRE 18-bus distribution system shows that this embedding-loss approach achieves low prediction errors, with bus voltage MSEs of 6.92e-07 (GCN), 1.21e-06 (GAT), 3.29e-05 (GPS), and 9.04e-07 (SAGE). Importantly, the physics-informed method ensures nearly zero SoC and C-rate constraint violations, confirming its effectiveness for reliable, constraint-compliant dispatch.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In this study, we employ Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories. This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited data availability.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Advancements in the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating human-sounding text have greatly increased the amount of human-to-computer interaction. As this field grows, the cultural alignment of these human-like agents becomes an important field of study. Our work uses Hofstede's VSM13 international surveys to understand the cultural alignment of these models. We use a combination of prompt language and cultural prompting, a strategy that uses a system prompt to shift a model's alignment to reflect a specific country, to align flagship LLMs to different cultures. Our results show that DeepSeek-V3, V3.1, and OpenAI's GPT-5 exhibit a close alignment with the survey responses of the United States and do not achieve a strong or soft alignment with China, even when using cultural prompts or changing the prompt language. We also find that GPT-4 exhibits an alignment closer to China when prompted in English, but cultural prompting is effective in shifting this alignment closer to the United States. Other low-cost models, GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, respond to the prompt language used (i.e., English or Simplified Chinese) and cultural prompting strategies to create acceptable alignments with both the United States and China.</p></details> |  |

Existing BFA discovery methods lack generalizability and struggle to scale, often failing to analyze the vast parameter space and complex interdependencies of modern foundation models in a reasonable time. This paper proposes FlipLLM, a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture-agnostic framework that formulates BFA discovery as a sequential decision-making problem. FlipLLM combines sensitivity-guided layer pruning with Q-learning to efficiently identify minimal, high-impact bit sets that can induce catastrophic failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of FlipLLM by applying it to a diverse set of models, including prominent text-only LLMs (GPT-2 Large, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and DeepSeek-V2 7B), VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6, and datasets, such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, VQAv2, and TextVQA. Our results show that FlipLLM can identify critical bits that are vulnerable to BFAs up to 2.5x faster than SOTA methods. We demonstrate that flipping the FlipLLM-identified bits plummets the accuracy of LLaMA 3.1 8B from 69.9% to ~0.2%, and for LLaVA's VQA score from 78% to almost 0%, by flipping as few as 5 and 7 bits, respectively. Further analysis reveals that applying standard hardware protection mechanisms, such as ECC SECDED, to the FlipLLM-identified bit locations completely mitigates the BFA impact, demonstrating the practical value of our framework in guiding hardware-level defenses. FlipLLM offers the first scalable and adaptive methodology for exploring the BFA vulnerability of both language and multimodal foundation models, paving the way for comprehensive hardware-security evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE HOST 2026</p></details> |

It is known that even $3$-Colouring is NP-complete for $H$-subgraph-free graphs whenever $H$ has a cycle; or a vertex of degree at least $5$; or a component with two vertices of degree $4$, while Colouring is polynomial-time solvable for $H$-subgraph-free graphs if $H$ is a forest of maximum degree at most $3$, in which each component has at most one vertex of degree $3$. For connected graphs $H$, this means that it remains to consider when $H$ is tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$. We let $H$ be a so-called subdivided "H"-graph, which is either a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_0$: a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and no vertices of degree $3$, or a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_1$: a tree of maximum degree $3$ with exactly two vertices of degree $3$. In the literature, only a limited number of polynomial-time and NP-completeness results for these cases are known. We develop new polynomial-time techniques that allow us to determine the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs for all the remaining subdivided "H"-graphs, so we fully classify both cases. As a consequence, the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs has now been settled for all connected graphs $H$ except when $H$ is a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and at least one vertex of degree $3$; or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least three vertices of degree $3$. We also employ our new techniques to obtain the same new polynomial-time results for another classic graph problem, namely Stable Cut.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Graph Neural Network Training, Defense, Hypergraph Partitioning and Spectral Clustering via Adversarial Robustness Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14738v8)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a highly effective neural network architecture for processing graph-structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely solely on the features of the data as input, GNNs leverage both the graph structure, which represents the relationships between data points, and the feature matrix of the data to optimize their feature representation. This unique capability enables GNNs to achieve superior performance across various tasks. However, it also makes GNNs more susceptible to noise from both the graph structure and data features, which can significantly increase the training difficulty and degrade their performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method for selecting noise-sensitive training samples from the original training set to construct a smaller yet more effective training set for model training. These samples are used to help improve the model's ability to correctly process data in noisy environments. We have evaluated our approach on three of the most classical GNN models GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE as well as three widely used benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially boost the training of Graph Neural Networks compared to using randomly sampled training sets of the same size from the original training set and the larger original full training set. We further proposed a robust-node based hypergraph partitioning method, an adversarial robustness based graph pruning method for GNN defenses, a robust spectral clustering method and a related spectral edge attack method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modality-Specific Enhancement and Complementary Fusion for Semi-Supervised Multi-Modal Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09801v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has become a promising direction for medical image segmentation, enabling models to learn from limited labeled data alongside abundant unlabeled samples. However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary effects of our proposed MEM and CIF in bridging cross-modality discrepancies and improving segmentation robustness under scarce supervision.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

Even worse, these applications often have strict, yet heterogeneous, performance requirements across metrics like latency and reliability. Much recent work has thus focused on developing the ability to predict network performance. However, traditional methods for network modeling, like discrete event simulators and emulation, often fail to balance accuracy and scalability. Network Digital Twins (NDTs), augmented by machine learning, present a viable solution by creating virtual replicas of physical networks for real- time simulation and analysis. State-of-the-art models, however, fall short of full-fledged NDTs, as they often focus only on a single performance metric or simulated network data. We introduce M3Net, a Multi-Metric Mixture-of-experts (MoE) NDT that uses a graph neural network architecture to estimate multiple performance metrics from an expanded set of network state data in a range of scenarios. We show that M3Net significantly enhances the accuracy of flow delay predictions by reducing the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) from 20.06% to 17.39%, while also achieving 66.47% and 78.7% accuracy on jitter and packets dropped for each flow</p></details> |  |

Wallets, typically categorized as hot and cold, offer varying degrees of security and convenience. However, they are generally software-based applications running on microcontrollers. Consequently, they are vulnerable to malware and side-channel attacks, allowing perpetrators to extract private keys by targeting critical algorithms, such as ECC, which processes private keys to generate public keys and authorize transactions. To address these issues, this work presents EthVault, the first hardware architecture for an Ethereum hierarchically deterministic cold wallet, featuring hardware implementations of key algorithms for secure key generation. Also, an ECC architecture resilient to side-channel and timing attacks is proposed. Moreover, an architecture of the child key derivation function, a fundamental component of cryptocurrency wallets, is proposed. The design minimizes resource usage, meeting market demand for small, portable cryptocurrency wallets. FPGA implementation results validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The ECC architecture exhibits uniform execution behavior across varying inputs, while the complete design utilizes only 27%, 7%, and 6% of LUTs, registers, and RAM blocks, respectively, on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IET Blockchain</p></details> |

However, existing deep learning approaches often lack explicit three-phase representation, making it difficult to accurately model phase-specific dynamics and enforce operational constraints--leading to infeasible dispatch solutions. This paper demonstrates that by embedding detailed three-phase grid information--including phase voltages, unbalanced loads, and BESS states--into heterogeneous graph nodes, diverse GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GPS) can jointly predict network state variables with high accuracy. Moreover, a physics-informed loss function incorporates critical battery constraints--SoC and C-rate limits--via soft penalties during training. Experimental validation on the CIGRE 18-bus distribution system shows that this embedding-loss approach achieves low prediction errors, with bus voltage MSEs of 6.92e-07 (GCN), 1.21e-06 (GAT), 3.29e-05 (GPS), and 9.04e-07 (SAGE). Importantly, the physics-informed method ensures nearly zero SoC and C-rate constraint violations, confirming its effectiveness for reliable, constraint-compliant dispatch.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In this study, we employ Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories. This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited data availability.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, their massive scale, often billions of parameters, poses significant challenges for real-time deployment, as inference becomes computationally expensive and latency-sensitive in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose Token Expand-and-Merge-VLA (TEAM-VLA), a training-free token compression framework that accelerates VLA inference while preserving task performance. TEAM-VLA introduces a dynamic token expansion mechanism that identifies and samples additional informative tokens in the spatial vicinity of attention-highlighted regions, enhancing contextual completeness. These expanded tokens are then selectively merged in deeper layers under action-aware guidance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic coherence. By coupling expansion and merging within a single feed-forward pass, TEAM-VLA achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, without any retraining or parameter updates. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TEAM-VLA consistently improves inference speed while maintaining or even surpassing the task success rate of full VLA models. The code is public available on \href{https://github.com/Jasper-aaa/TEAM-VLA}{https://github.com/Jasper-aaa/TEAM-VLA}</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, these methods degrade sharply under sparse-view settings, where limited observations lead to severe ambiguity between geometry, reflectance, and lighting. We introduce GAINS (Gaussian-based Inverse rendering from Sparse multi-view captures), a two-stage inverse rendering framework that leverages learning-based priors to stabilize geometry and material estimation. GAINS first refines geometry using monocular depth/normal and diffusion priors, then employs segmentation, intrinsic image decomposition (IID), and diffusion priors to regularize material recovery. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that GAINS significantly improves material parameter accuracy, relighting quality, and novel-view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods, especially under sparse-view settings.

This direction offers efficient rendering and seamless integration with diffusion-based pipelines. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation: The VAE latent space lacks multi-view consistency, leading to blurred textures and missing details during 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches attempt to address this by fine-tuning the VAE, at the cost of reconstruction quality, or by relying on pre-trained diffusion models to recover fine-grained details, at the risk of some hallucinations. We present Splatent, a diffusion-based enhancement framework designed to operate on top of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in the latent space of VAEs. Our key insight departs from the conventional 3D-centric view: rather than reconstructing fine-grained details in 3D space, we recover them in 2D from input views through multi-view attention mechanisms. This approach preserves the reconstruction quality of pretrained VAEs while achieving faithful detail recovery. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, Splatent establishes a new state-of-the-art for VAE latent radiance field reconstruction. We further demonstrate that integrating our method with existing feed-forward frameworks, consistently improves detail preservation, opening new possibilities for high-quality sparse-view 3D reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art MIAs rely on training hundreds of shadow models that are independent of the target model, leading to significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Imitative Membership Inference Attack (IMIA), which employs a novel imitative training technique to strategically construct a small number of target-informed imitative models that closely replicate the target model's behavior for inference. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IMIA substantially outperforms existing MIAs in various attack settings while only requiring less than 5% of the computational cost of state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/zealscott/IMIA</p></details> |

Recent advances in shortest path-biased BP routing (SP-BP) mitigate shortcomings such as slow startup and random walks, yet exclusive link-level commodity selection still causes last-packet problem and bandwidth underutilization. By revisiting the Lyapunov drift theory underlying BP, we show that the legacy exclusive commodity selection is unnecessary, and propose a Maximum Utility (MaxU) link-sharing method to expand its performance envelope without increasing control message overhead. Numerical results show that MaxU SP-BP substantially mitigates the last-packet problem and slightly expands the network capacity region.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

| **[Diffusion Posterior Sampler for Hyperspectral Unmixing with Spectral Variability Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09871v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear spectral mixture models (LMM) provide a concise form to disentangle the constituent materials (endmembers) and their corresponding proportions (abundance) in a single pixel. The critical challenges are how to model the spectral prior distribution and spectral variability. Prior knowledge and spectral variability can be rigorously modeled under the Bayesian framework, where posterior estimation of Abundance is derived by combining observed data with endmember prior distribution. Considering the key challenges and the advantages of the Bayesian framework, a novel method using a diffusion posterior sampler for semiblind unmixing, denoted as DPS4Un, is proposed to deal with these challenges with the following features: (1) we view the pretrained conditional spectrum diffusion model as a posterior sampler, which can combine the learned endmember prior with observation to get the refined abundance distribution. (2) Instead of using the existing spectral library as prior, which may raise bias, we establish the image-based endmember bundles within superpixels, which are used to train the endmember prior learner with diffusion model. Superpixels make sure the sub-scene is more homogeneous. (3) Instead of using the image-level data consistency constraint, the superpixel-based data fidelity term is proposed. (4) The endmember is initialized as Gaussian noise for each superpixel region, DPS4Un iteratively updates the abundance and endmember, contributing to spectral variability modeling. The experimental results on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that DPS4Un outperforms the state-of-the-art hyperspectral unmixing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09790v3)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models are a class of generative models that construct sequences by progressively denoising samples from a categorical noise distribution. Beyond their rapidly growing ability to generate coherent natural language, these models present a new and important opportunity to enforce sequence-level constraints, a capability that current autoregressive models cannot natively provide. This paper capitalizes on this opportunity by introducing Constrained Discrete Diffusion (CDD), a novel integration of differentiable constraint optimization within the diffusion process to ensure adherence to constraints, logic rules, or safety requirements for generated sequences. Unlike conventional text generators that often rely on post-hoc filtering or model retraining for controllable generation, CDD directly imposes constraints into the discrete diffusion sampling process, resulting in a training-free and effective approach. Experiments in toxicity-controlled text generation, property-constrained molecule design, and instruction-constrained text completion demonstrate that CDD achieves zero constraint violations in a diverse array of tasks while preserving fluency, novelty, and coherence while outperforming autoregressive and existing discrete diffusion approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

See-through-skin (STS) sensors, which combine tactile and visual perception, offer promising sensing capabilities, while modern imitation learning provides powerful tools for policy acquisition. However, existing STS designs lack simultaneous multimodal perception and suffer from unreliable tactile tracking. Furthermore, integrating these rich multimodal signals into learning-based manipulation pipelines remains an open challenge. We introduce TacThru, an STS sensor enabling simultaneous visual perception and robust tactile signal extraction, and TacThru-UMI, an imitation learning framework that leverages these multimodal signals for manipulation. Our sensor features a fully transparent elastomer, persistent illumination, novel keyline markers, and efficient tracking, while our learning system integrates these signals through a Transformer-based Diffusion Policy. Experiments on five challenging real-world tasks show that TacThru-UMI achieves an average success rate of 85.5%, significantly outperforming the baselines of alternating tactile-visual (66.3%) and vision-only (55.4%). The system excels in critical scenarios, including contact detection with thin and soft objects and precision manipulation requiring multimodal coordination. This work demonstrates that combining simultaneous multimodal perception with modern learning frameworks enables more precise, adaptable robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |

However, their massive scale, often billions of parameters, poses significant challenges for real-time deployment, as inference becomes computationally expensive and latency-sensitive in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose Token Expand-and-Merge-VLA (TEAM-VLA), a training-free token compression framework that accelerates VLA inference while preserving task performance. TEAM-VLA introduces a dynamic token expansion mechanism that identifies and samples additional informative tokens in the spatial vicinity of attention-highlighted regions, enhancing contextual completeness. These expanded tokens are then selectively merged in deeper layers under action-aware guidance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic coherence. By coupling expansion and merging within a single feed-forward pass, TEAM-VLA achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, without any retraining or parameter updates. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TEAM-VLA consistently improves inference speed while maintaining or even surpassing the task success rate of full VLA models.

Existing BFA discovery methods lack generalizability and struggle to scale, often failing to analyze the vast parameter space and complex interdependencies of modern foundation models in a reasonable time. This paper proposes FlipLLM, a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture-agnostic framework that formulates BFA discovery as a sequential decision-making problem. FlipLLM combines sensitivity-guided layer pruning with Q-learning to efficiently identify minimal, high-impact bit sets that can induce catastrophic failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of FlipLLM by applying it to a diverse set of models, including prominent text-only LLMs (GPT-2 Large, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and DeepSeek-V2 7B), VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6, and datasets, such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, VQAv2, and TextVQA. Our results show that FlipLLM can identify critical bits that are vulnerable to BFAs up to 2.5x faster than SOTA methods. We demonstrate that flipping the FlipLLM-identified bits plummets the accuracy of LLaMA 3.1 8B from 69.9% to ~0.2%, and for LLaVA's VQA score from 78% to almost 0%, by flipping as few as 5 and 7 bits, respectively. Further analysis reveals that applying standard hardware protection mechanisms, such as ECC SECDED, to the FlipLLM-identified bit locations completely mitigates the BFA impact, demonstrating the practical value of our framework in guiding hardware-level defenses. FlipLLM offers the first scalable and adaptive methodology for exploring the BFA vulnerability of both language and multimodal foundation models, paving the way for comprehensive hardware-security evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE HOST 2026</p></details> |

Traditional pseudo-random numbers may offer statistical unpredictability, but are ultimately deterministic. On the other hand, True Random Number Generation (TRNG) offers true randomness. One way of obtaining such randomness are quantum systems, including quantum computers. As such the use of quantum computers for TRNG has received considerable attention in recent years. However, existing studies almost exclusively consider IBM quantum computers, often stop at using simulations and usually test only a handful of different TRNG quantum circuits. In this paper, we address those issues by presenting a study of TRNG circuits on Odra 5 a real-life quantum computer installed at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. It is also the first study to utilize the IQM superconducting architecture. Since Odra 5 is available on-premises it allows for much more comprehensive study of various TRNG circuits. In particular, we consider 5 types of TRNG circuits with 105 circuit subvariants in total. Each circuit is used to generate 1 million bits. We then perform an analysis of the quality of the obtained random sequences using the NIST SP 800-22 and NIST SP 800-90B test suites. We also provide a comprehensive review of existing literature on quantum computer-based TRNGs.</p></details> |  |

It is known that even $3$-Colouring is NP-complete for $H$-subgraph-free graphs whenever $H$ has a cycle; or a vertex of degree at least $5$; or a component with two vertices of degree $4$, while Colouring is polynomial-time solvable for $H$-subgraph-free graphs if $H$ is a forest of maximum degree at most $3$, in which each component has at most one vertex of degree $3$. For connected graphs $H$, this means that it remains to consider when $H$ is tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$. We let $H$ be a so-called subdivided "H"-graph, which is either a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_0$: a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and no vertices of degree $3$, or a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_1$: a tree of maximum degree $3$ with exactly two vertices of degree $3$. In the literature, only a limited number of polynomial-time and NP-completeness results for these cases are known. We develop new polynomial-time techniques that allow us to determine the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs for all the remaining subdivided "H"-graphs, so we fully classify both cases. As a consequence, the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs has now been settled for all connected graphs $H$ except when $H$ is a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and at least one vertex of degree $3$; or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least three vertices of degree $3$. We also employ our new techniques to obtain the same new polynomial-time results for another classic graph problem, namely Stable Cut.</p></details> |  |

However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary effects of our proposed MEM and CIF in bridging cross-modality discrepancies and improving segmentation robustness under scarce supervision.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

In this study, we employ Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories. This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.

Advancements in the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating human-sounding text have greatly increased the amount of human-to-computer interaction. As this field grows, the cultural alignment of these human-like agents becomes an important field of study. Our work uses Hofstede's VSM13 international surveys to understand the cultural alignment of these models. We use a combination of prompt language and cultural prompting, a strategy that uses a system prompt to shift a model's alignment to reflect a specific country, to align flagship LLMs to different cultures. Our results show that DeepSeek-V3, V3.1, and OpenAI's GPT-5 exhibit a close alignment with the survey responses of the United States and do not achieve a strong or soft alignment with China, even when using cultural prompts or changing the prompt language. We also find that GPT-4 exhibits an alignment closer to China when prompted in English, but cultural prompting is effective in shifting this alignment closer to the United States. Other low-cost models, GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, respond to the prompt language used (i.e., English or Simplified Chinese) and cultural prompting strategies to create acceptable alignments with both the United States and China.</p></details> |  |

However, their massive scale, often billions of parameters, poses significant challenges for real-time deployment, as inference becomes computationally expensive and latency-sensitive in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose Token Expand-and-Merge-VLA (TEAM-VLA), a training-free token compression framework that accelerates VLA inference while preserving task performance. TEAM-VLA introduces a dynamic token expansion mechanism that identifies and samples additional informative tokens in the spatial vicinity of attention-highlighted regions, enhancing contextual completeness. These expanded tokens are then selectively merged in deeper layers under action-aware guidance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic coherence. By coupling expansion and merging within a single feed-forward pass, TEAM-VLA achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, without any retraining or parameter updates. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TEAM-VLA consistently improves inference speed while maintaining or even surpassing the task success rate of full VLA models.

However, their ability to proactively reason and act based solely on visual inputs, without explicit textual prompts, remains underexplored. We introduce a new task, Visual Action Reasoning, and propose VisualActBench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 1,074 videos and 3,733 human-annotated actions across four real-world scenarios. Each action is labeled with an Action Prioritization Level (APL) and a proactive-reactive type to assess models' human-aligned reasoning and value sensitivity. We evaluate 29 VLMs on VisualActBench and find that while frontier models like GPT4o demonstrate relatively strong performance, a significant gap remains compared to human-level reasoning, particularly in generating proactive, high-priority actions. Our results highlight limitations in current VLMs' ability to interpret complex context, anticipate outcomes, and align with human decision-making frameworks. VisualActBench establishes a comprehensive foundation for assessing and improving the real-world readiness of proactive, vision-centric AI agents.</p></details> |  |

Existing BFA discovery methods lack generalizability and struggle to scale, often failing to analyze the vast parameter space and complex interdependencies of modern foundation models in a reasonable time. This paper proposes FlipLLM, a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture-agnostic framework that formulates BFA discovery as a sequential decision-making problem. FlipLLM combines sensitivity-guided layer pruning with Q-learning to efficiently identify minimal, high-impact bit sets that can induce catastrophic failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of FlipLLM by applying it to a diverse set of models, including prominent text-only LLMs (GPT-2 Large, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and DeepSeek-V2 7B), VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6, and datasets, such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, VQAv2, and TextVQA. Our results show that FlipLLM can identify critical bits that are vulnerable to BFAs up to 2.5x faster than SOTA methods. We demonstrate that flipping the FlipLLM-identified bits plummets the accuracy of LLaMA 3.1 8B from 69.9% to ~0.2%, and for LLaVA's VQA score from 78% to almost 0%, by flipping as few as 5 and 7 bits, respectively. Further analysis reveals that applying standard hardware protection mechanisms, such as ECC SECDED, to the FlipLLM-identified bit locations completely mitigates the BFA impact, demonstrating the practical value of our framework in guiding hardware-level defenses. FlipLLM offers the first scalable and adaptive methodology for exploring the BFA vulnerability of both language and multimodal foundation models, paving the way for comprehensive hardware-security evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE HOST 2026</p></details> |

Traditional pseudo-random numbers may offer statistical unpredictability, but are ultimately deterministic. On the other hand, True Random Number Generation (TRNG) offers true randomness. One way of obtaining such randomness are quantum systems, including quantum computers. As such the use of quantum computers for TRNG has received considerable attention in recent years. However, existing studies almost exclusively consider IBM quantum computers, often stop at using simulations and usually test only a handful of different TRNG quantum circuits. In this paper, we address those issues by presenting a study of TRNG circuits on Odra 5 a real-life quantum computer installed at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. It is also the first study to utilize the IQM superconducting architecture. Since Odra 5 is available on-premises it allows for much more comprehensive study of various TRNG circuits. In particular, we consider 5 types of TRNG circuits with 105 circuit subvariants in total. Each circuit is used to generate 1 million bits. We then perform an analysis of the quality of the obtained random sequences using the NIST SP 800-22 and NIST SP 800-90B test suites. We also provide a comprehensive review of existing literature on quantum computer-based TRNGs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Colouring Graphs Without a Subdivided H-Graph: A Full Complexity Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09859v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider Colouring on graphs that are $H$-subgraph-free for some fixed graph $H$, i.e., graphs that do not contain $H$ as a subgraph. It is known that even $3$-Colouring is NP-complete for $H$-subgraph-free graphs whenever $H$ has a cycle; or a vertex of degree at least $5$; or a component with two vertices of degree $4$, while Colouring is polynomial-time solvable for $H$-subgraph-free graphs if $H$ is a forest of maximum degree at most $3$, in which each component has at most one vertex of degree $3$. For connected graphs $H$, this means that it remains to consider when $H$ is tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$. We let $H$ be a so-called subdivided "H"-graph, which is either a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_0$: a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and no vertices of degree $3$, or a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_1$: a tree of maximum degree $3$ with exactly two vertices of degree $3$. In the literature, only a limited number of polynomial-time and NP-completeness results for these cases are known. We develop new polynomial-time techniques that allow us to determine the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs for all the remaining subdivided "H"-graphs, so we fully classify both cases. As a consequence, the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs has now been settled for all connected graphs $H$ except when $H$ is a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and at least one vertex of degree $3$; or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least three vertices of degree $3$. We also employ our new techniques to obtain the same new polynomial-time results for another classic graph problem, namely Stable Cut.</p></details> |  |

However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary effects of our proposed MEM and CIF in bridging cross-modality discrepancies and improving segmentation robustness under scarce supervision.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

Wallets, typically categorized as hot and cold, offer varying degrees of security and convenience. However, they are generally software-based applications running on microcontrollers. Consequently, they are vulnerable to malware and side-channel attacks, allowing perpetrators to extract private keys by targeting critical algorithms, such as ECC, which processes private keys to generate public keys and authorize transactions. To address these issues, this work presents EthVault, the first hardware architecture for an Ethereum hierarchically deterministic cold wallet, featuring hardware implementations of key algorithms for secure key generation. Also, an ECC architecture resilient to side-channel and timing attacks is proposed. Moreover, an architecture of the child key derivation function, a fundamental component of cryptocurrency wallets, is proposed. The design minimizes resource usage, meeting market demand for small, portable cryptocurrency wallets. FPGA implementation results validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The ECC architecture exhibits uniform execution behavior across varying inputs, while the complete design utilizes only 27%, 7%, and 6% of LUTs, registers, and RAM blocks, respectively, on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IET Blockchain</p></details> |
| **[Physics-Aware Heterogeneous GNN Architecture for Real-Time BESS Optimization in Unbalanced Distribution Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09780v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Battery energy storage systems (BESS) have become increasingly vital in three-phase unbalanced distribution grids for maintaining voltage stability and enabling optimal dispatch. However, existing deep learning approaches often lack explicit three-phase representation, making it difficult to accurately model phase-specific dynamics and enforce operational constraints--leading to infeasible dispatch solutions. This paper demonstrates that by embedding detailed three-phase grid information--including phase voltages, unbalanced loads, and BESS states--into heterogeneous graph nodes, diverse GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GPS) can jointly predict network state variables with high accuracy. Moreover, a physics-informed loss function incorporates critical battery constraints--SoC and C-rate limits--via soft penalties during training. Experimental validation on the CIGRE 18-bus distribution system shows that this embedding-loss approach achieves low prediction errors, with bus voltage MSEs of 6.92e-07 (GCN), 1.21e-06 (GAT), 3.29e-05 (GPS), and 9.04e-07 (SAGE). Importantly, the physics-informed method ensures nearly zero SoC and C-rate constraint violations, confirming its effectiveness for reliable, constraint-compliant dispatch.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In this study, we employ Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories. This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited data availability.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Advancements in the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating human-sounding text have greatly increased the amount of human-to-computer interaction. As this field grows, the cultural alignment of these human-like agents becomes an important field of study. Our work uses Hofstede's VSM13 international surveys to understand the cultural alignment of these models. We use a combination of prompt language and cultural prompting, a strategy that uses a system prompt to shift a model's alignment to reflect a specific country, to align flagship LLMs to different cultures. Our results show that DeepSeek-V3, V3.1, and OpenAI's GPT-5 exhibit a close alignment with the survey responses of the United States and do not achieve a strong or soft alignment with China, even when using cultural prompts or changing the prompt language. We also find that GPT-4 exhibits an alignment closer to China when prompted in English, but cultural prompting is effective in shifting this alignment closer to the United States. Other low-cost models, GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, respond to the prompt language used (i.e., English or Simplified Chinese) and cultural prompting strategies to create acceptable alignments with both the United States and China.</p></details> |  |

FlipLLM offers the first scalable and adaptive methodology for exploring the BFA vulnerability of both language and multimodal foundation models, paving the way for comprehensive hardware-security evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE HOST 2026</p></details> |
| **[True Random Number Generators on IQM Spark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09862v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random number generation is fundamental for many modern applications including cryptography, simulations and machine learning. Traditional pseudo-random numbers may offer statistical unpredictability, but are ultimately deterministic. On the other hand, True Random Number Generation (TRNG) offers true randomness. One way of obtaining such randomness are quantum systems, including quantum computers. As such the use of quantum computers for TRNG has received considerable attention in recent years. However, existing studies almost exclusively consider IBM quantum computers, often stop at using simulations and usually test only a handful of different TRNG quantum circuits. In this paper, we address those issues by presenting a study of TRNG circuits on Odra 5 a real-life quantum computer installed at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. It is also the first study to utilize the IQM superconducting architecture. Since Odra 5 is available on-premises it allows for much more comprehensive study of various TRNG circuits. In particular, we consider 5 types of TRNG circuits with 105 circuit subvariants in total. Each circuit is used to generate 1 million bits. We then perform an analysis of the quality of the obtained random sequences using the NIST SP 800-22 and NIST SP 800-90B test suites. We also provide a comprehensive review of existing literature on quantum computer-based TRNGs.</p></details> |  |

It is known that even $3$-Colouring is NP-complete for $H$-subgraph-free graphs whenever $H$ has a cycle; or a vertex of degree at least $5$; or a component with two vertices of degree $4$, while Colouring is polynomial-time solvable for $H$-subgraph-free graphs if $H$ is a forest of maximum degree at most $3$, in which each component has at most one vertex of degree $3$. For connected graphs $H$, this means that it remains to consider when $H$ is tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$. We let $H$ be a so-called subdivided "H"-graph, which is either a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_0$: a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and no vertices of degree $3$, or a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_1$: a tree of maximum degree $3$ with exactly two vertices of degree $3$. In the literature, only a limited number of polynomial-time and NP-completeness results for these cases are known. We develop new polynomial-time techniques that allow us to determine the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs for all the remaining subdivided "H"-graphs, so we fully classify both cases. As a consequence, the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs has now been settled for all connected graphs $H$ except when $H$ is a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and at least one vertex of degree $3$; or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least three vertices of degree $3$. We also employ our new techniques to obtain the same new polynomial-time results for another classic graph problem, namely Stable Cut.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modality-Specific Enhancement and Complementary Fusion for Semi-Supervised Multi-Modal Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09801v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has become a promising direction for medical image segmentation, enabling models to learn from limited labeled data alongside abundant unlabeled samples. However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary effects of our proposed MEM and CIF in bridging cross-modality discrepancies and improving segmentation robustness under scarce supervision.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[EthVault: A Secure and Resource-Conscious FPGA-Based Ethereum Cold Wallet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23847v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cryptocurrency blockchain networks safeguard digital assets using cryptographic keys, with wallets playing a critical role in generating, storing, and managing these keys. Wallets, typically categorized as hot and cold, offer varying degrees of security and convenience. However, they are generally software-based applications running on microcontrollers. Consequently, they are vulnerable to malware and side-channel attacks, allowing perpetrators to extract private keys by targeting critical algorithms, such as ECC, which processes private keys to generate public keys and authorize transactions. To address these issues, this work presents EthVault, the first hardware architecture for an Ethereum hierarchically deterministic cold wallet, featuring hardware implementations of key algorithms for secure key generation. Also, an ECC architecture resilient to side-channel and timing attacks is proposed. Moreover, an architecture of the child key derivation function, a fundamental component of cryptocurrency wallets, is proposed. The design minimizes resource usage, meeting market demand for small, portable cryptocurrency wallets. FPGA implementation results validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The ECC architecture exhibits uniform execution behavior across varying inputs, while the complete design utilizes only 27%, 7%, and 6% of LUTs, registers, and RAM blocks, respectively, on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IET Blockchain</p></details> |
| **[Physics-Aware Heterogeneous GNN Architecture for Real-Time BESS Optimization in Unbalanced Distribution Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09780v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Battery energy storage systems (BESS) have become increasingly vital in three-phase unbalanced distribution grids for maintaining voltage stability and enabling optimal dispatch. However, existing deep learning approaches often lack explicit three-phase representation, making it difficult to accurately model phase-specific dynamics and enforce operational constraints--leading to infeasible dispatch solutions. This paper demonstrates that by embedding detailed three-phase grid information--including phase voltages, unbalanced loads, and BESS states--into heterogeneous graph nodes, diverse GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GPS) can jointly predict network state variables with high accuracy. Moreover, a physics-informed loss function incorporates critical battery constraints--SoC and C-rate limits--via soft penalties during training. Experimental validation on the CIGRE 18-bus distribution system shows that this embedding-loss approach achieves low prediction errors, with bus voltage MSEs of 6.92e-07 (GCN), 1.21e-06 (GAT), 3.29e-05 (GPS), and 9.04e-07 (SAGE). Importantly, the physics-informed method ensures nearly zero SoC and C-rate constraint violations, confirming its effectiveness for reliable, constraint-compliant dispatch.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Reasoning Skills in Small Persian Medical Language Models Can Outperform Large-Scale Data Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20059v4)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories. This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited data availability.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Advancements in the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating human-sounding text have greatly increased the amount of human-to-computer interaction. As this field grows, the cultural alignment of these human-like agents becomes an important field of study. Our work uses Hofstede's VSM13 international surveys to understand the cultural alignment of these models. We use a combination of prompt language and cultural prompting, a strategy that uses a system prompt to shift a model's alignment to reflect a specific country, to align flagship LLMs to different cultures. Our results show that DeepSeek-V3, V3.1, and OpenAI's GPT-5 exhibit a close alignment with the survey responses of the United States and do not achieve a strong or soft alignment with China, even when using cultural prompts or changing the prompt language. We also find that GPT-4 exhibits an alignment closer to China when prompted in English, but cultural prompting is effective in shifting this alignment closer to the United States. Other low-cost models, GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, respond to the prompt language used (i.e., English or Simplified Chinese) and cultural prompting strategies to create acceptable alignments with both the United States and China.</p></details> |  |
