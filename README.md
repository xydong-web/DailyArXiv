Generally speaking, two families of techniques have emerged for solving this problem for gradient-based guidance: namely, posterior guidance (i.e., guidance via projecting the current sample to the target distribution via the target prediction model) and end-to-end guidance (i.e., guidance by performing backpropagation throughout the entire ODE solve). In this work, we show that these two seemingly separate families can actually be unified by looking at posterior guidance as a greedy strategy of end-to-end guidance. We explore the theoretical connections between these two families and provide an in-depth theoretical of these two techniques relative to the continuous ideal gradients. Motivated by this analysis we then show a method for interpolating between these two families enabling a trade-off between compute and accuracy of the guidance gradients. We then validate this work on several inverse image problems and property-guided molecular generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised preprint with numerical experiments</p></details> |
| **[DICE: Device-level Integrated Circuits Encoder with Graph Contrastive Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08949v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretraining models with unsupervised graph representation learning has led to significant advancements in domains such as social network analysis, molecular design, and electronic design automation (EDA). However, prior work in EDA has mainly focused on pretraining models for digital circuits, overlooking analog and mixed-signal circuits. To bridge this gap, we introduce DICE, a Device-level Integrated Circuits Encoder, which is the first graph neural network (GNN) pretrained via self-supervised learning specifically tailored for graph-level prediction tasks in both analog and digital circuits. DICE adopts a simulation-free pretraining approach based on graph contrastive learning, leveraging two novel graph augmentation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements across three downstream tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of DICE for both analog and digital circuits. The code is available at github.com/brianlsy98/DICE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimum-Excess-Work Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13375v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a regularization framework inspired by thermodynamic work for guiding pre-trained probability flow generative models (e.g., continuous normalizing flows or diffusion models) by minimizing excess work, a concept rooted in statistical mechanics and with strong conceptual connections to optimal transport. Our approach enables efficient guidance in sparse-data regimes common to scientific applications, where only limited target samples or partial density constraints are available. We introduce two strategies: Path Guidance for sampling rare transition states by concentrating probability mass on user-defined subsets, and Observable Guidance for aligning generated distributions with experimental observables while preserving entropy. We demonstrate the framework's versatility on a coarse-grained protein model, guiding it to sample transition configurations between folded/unfolded states and correct systematic biases using experimental data. The method bridges thermodynamic principles with modern generative architectures, offering a principled, efficient, and physics-inspired alternative to standard fine-tuning in data-scarce domains. Empirical results highlight improved sample efficiency and bias reduction, underscoring its applicability to molecular simulations and beyond.</p></details> | 30 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Neural Functional: Learning Function to Scalar Maps for Neural PDE Surrogates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13275v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many architectures for neural PDE surrogates have been proposed in recent years, largely based on neural networks or operator learning. In this work, we derive and propose a new architecture, the Neural Functional, which learns function to scalar mappings. Its implementation leverages insights from operator learning and neural fields, and we show the ability of neural functionals to implicitly learn functional derivatives. For the first time, this allows for an extension of Hamiltonian mechanics to neural PDE surrogates by learning the Hamiltonian functional and optimizing its functional derivatives. We demonstrate that the Hamiltonian Neural Functional can be an effective surrogate model through improved stability and conserving energy-like quantities on 1D and 2D PDEs. Beyond PDEs, functionals are prevalent in physics; functional approximation and learning with its gradients may find other uses, such as in molecular dynamics or design optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 Pa...</summary><p>19 Pages, 7 Figures.

| **[Diffusion Models with Double Guidance: Generate with aggregated datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13213v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating large-scale datasets for training high-performance generative models is often prohibitively expensive, especially when associated attributes or annotations must be provided. As a result, merging existing datasets has become a common strategy. However, the sets of attributes across datasets are often inconsistent, and their naive concatenation typically leads to block-wise missing conditions. This presents a significant challenge for conditional generative modeling when the multiple attributes are used jointly as conditions, thereby limiting the model's controllability and applicability. To address this issue, we propose a novel generative approach, Diffusion Model with Double Guidance, which enables precise conditional generation even when no training samples contain all conditions simultaneously. Our method maintains rigorous control over multiple conditions without requiring joint annotations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in molecular and image generation tasks, where it outperforms existing baselines both in alignment with target conditional distributions and in controllability under missing condition settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inferring stochastic dynamics with growth from cross-sectional data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13197v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-resolved single-cell omics data offers high-throughput, genome-wide measurements of cellular states, which are instrumental to reverse-engineer the processes underpinning cell fate. Such technologies are inherently destructive, allowing only cross-sectional measurements of the underlying stochastic dynamical system. Furthermore, cells may divide or die in addition to changing their molecular state. Collectively these present a major challenge to inferring realistic biophysical models. We present a novel approach, \emph{unbalanced} probability flow inference, that addresses this challenge for biological processes modelled as stochastic dynamics with growth. By leveraging a Lagrangian formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation, our method accurately disentangles drift from intrinsic noise and growth. We showcase the applicability of our approach through evaluation on a range of simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Comparing to several existing methods, we find our method achieves higher accuracy while enjoying a simple two-step training scheme.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Test-Time Training Scaling Laws for Chemical Exploration in Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19153v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical Language Models (CLMs) leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) have shown promise in de novo molecular design, yet often suffer from mode collapse, limiting their exploration capabilities. Inspired by Test-Time Training (TTT) in large language models, we propose scaling TTT for CLMs to enhance chemical space exploration. We introduce MolExp, a novel benchmark emphasizing the discovery of structurally diverse molecules with similar bioactivity, simulating real-world drug design challenges. Our results demonstrate that scaling TTT by increasing the number of independent RL agents follows a log-linear scaling law, significantly improving exploration efficiency as measured by MolExp. In contrast, increasing TTT training time yields diminishing returns, even with exploration bonuses. We further evaluate cooperative RL strategies to enhance exploration efficiency. These findings provide a scalable framework for generative molecular design, offering insights into optimizing AI-driven drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Alignment for Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks and Learning Positional Encodings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13087v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel benchmarking methodology for graph neural networks (GNNs) based on the graph alignment problem, a combinatorial optimization task that generalizes graph isomorphism by aligning two unlabeled graphs to maximize overlapping edges. We frame this problem as a self-supervised learning task and present several methods to generate graph alignment datasets using synthetic random graphs and real-world graph datasets from multiple domains. For a given graph dataset, we generate a family of graph alignment datasets with increasing difficulty, allowing us to rank the performance of various architectures. Our experiments indicate that anisotropic graph neural networks outperform standard convolutional architectures. To further demonstrate the utility of the graph alignment task, we show its effectiveness for unsupervised GNN pre-training, where the learned node embeddings outperform other positional encodings on three molecular regression tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results on the PCQM4Mv2 dataset with significantly fewer parameters. To support reproducibility and further research, we provide an open-source Python package to generate graph alignment datasets and benchmark new GNN architectures.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Comprehensive Benchmarking Platform for Deep Generative Models in Molecular Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12848v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of novel pharmaceuticals represents a significant challenge in modern science, with substantial costs and time investments. Deep generative models have emerged as promising tools for accelerating drug discovery by efficiently exploring the vast chemical space. However, this rapidly evolving field lacks standardized evaluation protocols, impeding fair comparison between approaches. This research presents an extensive analysis of the Molecular Sets (MOSES) platform, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to standardize evaluation of deep generative models in molecular design. Through rigorous assessment of multiple generative architectures, including recurrent neural networks, variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks, we examine their capabilities in generating valid, unique, and novel molecular structures while maintaining specific chemical properties. Our findings reveal that different architectures exhibit complementary strengths across various metrics, highlighting the complex trade-offs between exploration and exploitation in chemical space. This study provides detailed insights into the current state of the art in molecular generation and establishes a foundation for future advancements in AI-driven drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Implementation of Gaussian Process Regression Accelerated Saddle Point Searches with Application to Molecular Reactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12519v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of locating first order saddle points on high-dimensional surfaces describing the variation of energy as a function of atomic coordinates is an essential step for identifying the mechanism and estimating the rate of thermally activated events within the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. When combined directly with electronic structure calculations, the number of energy and atomic force evaluations needed for convergence is a primary issue. Here, we describe an efficient implementation of Gaussian process regression (GPR) acceleration of the minimum mode following method where a dimer is used to estimate the lowest eigenmode of the Hessian. A surrogate energy surface is constructed and updated after each electronic structure calculation. The method is applied to a test set of 500 molecular reactions previously generated by Hermez and coworkers [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 18, 6974 (2022)]. An order of magnitude reduction in the number of electronic structure calculations needed to reach the saddle point configurations is obtained by using the GPR compared to the dimer method. Despite the wide range in stiffness of the molecular degrees of freedom, the calculations are carried out using Cartesian coordinates and are found to require similar number of electronic structure calculations as an elaborate internal coordinate method implemented in the Sella software package. The present implementation of the GPR surrogate model in C++ is efficient enough for the wall time of the saddle point searches to be reduced in 3 out of 4 cases even though the calculations are carried out at a low Hartree-Fock level.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Evolutionary training-free guidance in diffusion model for 3D multi-objective molecular generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11037v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering novel 3D molecular structures that simultaneously satisfy multiple property targets remains a central challenge in materials and drug design. Although recent diffusion-based models can generate 3D conformations, they require expensive retraining for each new property or property-combination and lack flexibility in enforcing structural constraints. We introduce EGD (Evolutionary Guidance in Diffusion), a training-free framework that embeds evolutionary operators directly into the diffusion sampling process. By performing crossover on noise-perturbed samples and then denoising them with a pretrained Unconditional diffusion model, EGD seamlessly blends structural fragments and steers generation toward user-specified objectives without any additional model updates. On both single- and multi-target 3D conditional generation tasks-and on multi-objective optimization of quantum properties EGD outperforms state-of-the-art conditional diffusion methods in accuracy and runs up to five times faster per generation. In the single-objective optimization of protein ligands, EGD enables customized ligand generation. Moreover, EGD can embed arbitrary 3D fragments into the generated molecules while optimizing multiple conflicting properties in one unified process. This combination of efficiency, flexibility, and controllable structure makes EGD a powerful tool for rapid, guided exploration of chemical space.</p></details> | Submit to NIPS2025 |

Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in task transfer, they often struggle to accurately analyze molecular features due to limited knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this issue, we present Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules and exhibits explainability and reasoning ability. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental molecular features, taking into account the essential abilities for molecular reasoning. Further, to improve molecular understanding, we propose a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and providing informative responses, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.

| **[GEOM-Drugs Revisited: Toward More Chemically Accurate Benchmarks for 3D Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00169v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models have shown significant promise in generating valid 3D molecular structures, with the GEOM-Drugs dataset serving as a key benchmark. However, current evaluation protocols suffer from critical flaws, including incorrect valency definitions, bugs in bond order calculations, and reliance on force fields inconsistent with the reference data. In this work, we revisit GEOM-Drugs and propose a corrected evaluation framework: we identify and fix issues in data preprocessing, construct chemically accurate valency tables, and introduce a GFN2-xTB-based geometry and energy benchmark. We retrain and re-evaluate several leading models under this framework, providing updated performance metrics and practical recommendations for future benchmarking. Our results underscore the need for chemically rigorous evaluation practices in 3D molecular generation.

| **[Pharmacophore-Conditioned Diffusion Model for Ligand-Based De Novo Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10545v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing bioactive molecules remains a central, time- and cost-heavy challenge in drug discovery, particularly for novel targets lacking structural or functional data. Pharmacophore modeling presents an alternative for capturing the key features required for molecular bioactivity against a biological target. In this work, we present PharmaDiff, a pharmacophore-conditioned diffusion model for 3D molecular generation. PharmaDiff employs a transformer-based architecture to integrate an atom-based representation of the 3D pharmacophore into the generative process, enabling the precise generation of 3D molecular graphs that align with predefined pharmacophore hypotheses. Through comprehensive testing, PharmaDiff demonstrates superior performance in matching 3D pharmacophore constraints compared to ligand-based drug design methods. Additionally, it achieves higher docking scores across a range of proteins in structure-based drug design, without the need for target protein structures. By integrating pharmacophore modeling with 3D generative techniques, PharmaDiff offers a powerful and flexible framework for rational drug design.</p></details> |  |
| **[All You Need Is Synthetic Task Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10120v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Injecting rule-based models like Random Forests into differentiable neural network frameworks remains an open challenge in machine learning. Recent advancements have demonstrated that pretrained models can generate efficient molecular embeddings. However, these approaches often require extensive pretraining and additional techniques, such as incorporating posterior probabilities, to boost performance. In our study, we propose a novel strategy that jointly trains a single Graph Transformer neural network on both sparse multitask molecular property experimental targets and synthetic targets derived from XGBoost models trained on Osmordred molecular descriptors. These synthetic tasks serve as independent auxiliary tasks. Our results show consistent and significant performance improvement across all 19 molecular property prediction tasks. For 16 out of 19 targets, the multitask Graph Transformer outperforms the XGBoost single-task learner. This demonstrates that synthetic task augmentation is an effective method for enhancing neural model performance in multitask molecular property prediction without the need for feature injection or pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 Figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Fragment-Masked Diffusion for Molecular Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09106v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, aimed at refining molecular structures to enhance drug efficacy and minimize side effects, ultimately accelerating the overall drug development process. Many molecular optimization methods have been proposed, significantly advancing drug discovery. These methods primarily on understanding the specific drug target structures or their hypothesized roles in combating diseases. However, challenges such as a limited number of available targets and a difficulty capturing clear structures hinder innovative drug development. In contrast, phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) does not depend on clear target structures and can identify hits with novel and unbiased polypharmacology signatures. As a result, PDD-based molecular optimization can reduce potential safety risks while optimizing phenotypic activity, thereby increasing the likelihood of clinical success. Therefore, we propose a fragment-masked molecular optimization method based on PDD (FMOP). FMOP employs a regression-free diffusion model to conditionally optimize the molecular masked regions, effectively generating new molecules with similar scaffolds. On the large-scale drug response dataset GDSCv2, we optimize the potential molecules across all 985 cell lines. The overall experiments demonstrate that the in-silico optimization success rate reaches 95.4\%, with an average efficacy increase of 7.5\%. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation and visualization experiments, confirming that FMOP is an effective and robust molecular optimization method. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FMOP-98C2.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Considerations in the use of ML interaction potentials for free energy calculations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13952v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) promise to accurately describe the potential energy surface of molecules at the ab initio level of theory with improved computational efficiency. Within MLFFs, equivariant graph neural networks (EQNNs) have shown great promise in accuracy and performance and are the focus of this work. The capability of EQNNs to recover free energy surfaces (FES) remains to be thoroughly investigated. In this work, we investigate the impact of collective variables (CVs) distribution within the training data on the accuracy of EQNNs predicting the FES of butane and alanine dipeptide (ADP). A generalizable workflow is presented in which training configurations are generated with classical molecular dynamics simulations, and energies and forces are obtained with ab initio calculations. We evaluate how bond and angle constraints in the training data influence the accuracy of EQNN force fields in reproducing the FES of the molecules at both classical and ab initio levels of theory. Results indicate that the model's accuracy is unaffected by the distribution of sampled CVs during training, given that the training data includes configurations from characteristic regions of the system's FES. However, when the training data is obtained from classical simulations, the EQNN struggles to extrapolate the free energy for configurations with high free energy. In contrast, models trained with the same configurations on ab initio data show improved extrapolation accuracy. The findings underscore the difficulties in creating a comprehensive training dataset for EQNNs to predict FESs and highlight the importance of prior knowledge of the system's FES.</p></details> |  |
| **[EDBench: Large-Scale Electron Density Data for Molecular Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09262v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing molecular machine learning force fields (MLFFs) generally focus on the learning of atoms, molecules, and simple quantum chemical properties (such as energy and force), but ignore the importance of electron density (ED) $\rho(r)$ in accurately understanding molecular force fields (MFFs). ED describes the probability of finding electrons at specific locations around atoms or molecules, which uniquely determines all ground state properties (such as energy, molecular structure, etc.) of interactive multi-particle systems according to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, the calculation of ED relies on the time-consuming first-principles density functional theory (DFT) which leads to the lack of large-scale ED data and limits its application in MLFFs. In this paper, we introduce EDBench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ED designed to advance learning-based research at the electronic scale. Built upon the PCQM4Mv2, EDBench provides accurate ED data, covering 3.3 million molecules. To comprehensively evaluate the ability of models to understand and utilize electronic information, we design a suite of ED-centric benchmark tasks spanning prediction, retrieval, and generation. Our evaluation on several state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that learning from EDBench is not only feasible but also achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we show that learning-based method can efficiently calculate ED with comparable precision while significantly reducing the computational cost relative to traditional DFT calculations. All data and benchmarks from EDBench will be freely available, laying a robust foundation for ED-driven drug discovery and materials science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Molecular Design with Steerable and Granular Synthesizability Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08774v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizability in small molecule generative design remains a bottleneck. Existing works that do consider synthesizability can output predicted synthesis routes for generated molecules. However, there has been minimal attention in addressing the ease of synthesis and enabling flexibility to incorporate desired reaction constraints. In this work, we propose a small molecule generative design framework that enables steerable and granular synthesizability control. Generated molecules satisfy arbitrary multi-parameter optimization objectives with predicted synthesis routes containing pre-defined allowed reactions, while optionally avoiding others. One can also enforce that all reactions belong to a pre-defined set. We show the capability to mix-and-match these reaction constraints across the most common medicinal chemistry transformations. Next, we show how our framework can be used to valorize industrial byproducts towards de novo optimized molecules. Going further, we demonstrate how granular control over synthesizability constraints can loosely mimic virtual screening of ultra-large make-on-demand libraries. Using only a single GPU, we generate and dock 15k molecules to identify promising candidates in Freedom 4.0 constituting 142B make-on-demand molecules (assessing only 0.00001% of the library). Generated molecules satisfying the reaction constraints have > 90% exact match rate. Lastly, we benchmark our framework against recent synthesizability-constrained generative models and demonstrate the highest sample efficiency even when imposing the additional constraint that all molecules must be synthesizable from a single reaction type. The main theme is demonstrating that a pre-trained generalist molecular generative model can be incentivized to generate property-optimized small molecules under challenging synthesizability constraints through reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose MetaMolGen, a first-order meta-learning-based molecular generator designed for few-shot and property-conditioned molecular generation. MetaMolGen standardizes the distribution of graph motifs by mapping them to a normalized latent space, and employs a lightweight autoregressive sequence model to generate SMILES sequences that faithfully reflect the underlying molecular structure. In addition, it supports conditional generation of molecules with target properties through a learnable property projector integrated into the generative process.Experimental results demonstrate that MetaMolGen consistently generates valid and diverse SMILES sequences under low-data regimes, outperforming conventional baselines. This highlights its advantage in fast adaptation and efficient conditional generation for practical molecular design.</p></details> |  |

Existing generative methods are restricted to single-domain molecules, failing to address versatile therapeutic needs or utilize cross-domain transferability to enhance model performance. In this paper, we introduce Unified generative Modeling of 3D Molecules (UniMoMo), the first framework capable of designing binders of multiple molecular domains using a single model. In particular, UniMoMo unifies the representations of different molecules as graphs of blocks, where each block corresponds to either a standard amino acid or a molecular fragment. Subsequently, UniMoMo utilizes a geometric latent diffusion model for 3D molecular generation, featuring an iterative full-atom autoencoder to compress blocks into latent space points, followed by an E(3)-equivariant diffusion process. Extensive benchmarks across peptides, antibodies, and small molecules demonstrate the superiority of our unified framework over existing domain-specific models, highlighting the benefits of multi-domain training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Modal Molecular Representation Learning via Structure Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05877v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate extraction of molecular representations is a critical step in the drug discovery process. In recent years, significant progress has been made in molecular representation learning methods, among which multi-modal molecular representation methods based on images, and 2D/3D topologies have become increasingly mainstream. However, existing these multi-modal approaches often directly fuse information from different modalities, overlooking the potential of intermodal interactions and failing to adequately capture the complex higher-order relationships and invariant features between molecules. To overcome these challenges, we propose a structure-awareness-based multi-modal self-supervised molecular representation pre-training framework (MMSA) designed to enhance molecular graph representations by leveraging invariant knowledge between molecules. The framework consists of two main modules: the multi-modal molecular representation learning module and the structure-awareness module. The multi-modal molecular representation learning module collaboratively processes information from different modalities of the same molecule to overcome intermodal differences and generate a unified molecular embedding. Subsequently, the structure-awareness module enhances the molecular representation by constructing a hypergraph structure to model higher-order correlations between molecules. This module also introduces a memory mechanism for storing typical molecular representations, aligning them with memory anchors in the memory bank to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the model generalization ability. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of MMSA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MoleculeNet benchmark, with average ROC-AUC improvements ranging from 1.8% to 9.6% over baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP) 2025</p></details> |

| **[Cayley Graph Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03424v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In spite of the plethora of success stories with graph neural networks (GNNs) on modelling graph-structured data, they are notoriously vulnerable to over-squashing, whereby tasks necessitate the mixing of information between distance pairs of nodes. To address this problem, prior work suggests rewiring the graph structure to improve information flow. Alternatively, a significant body of research has dedicated itself to discovering and precomputing bottleneck-free graph structures to ameliorate over-squashing. One well regarded family of bottleneck-free graphs within the mathematical community are expander graphs, with prior work -- Expander Graph Propagation (EGP) -- proposing the use of a well-known expander graph family -- the Cayley graphs of the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ special linear group -- as a computational template for GNNs. However, in EGP the computational graphs used are truncated to align with a given input graph. In this work, we show that truncation is detrimental to the coveted expansion properties. Instead, we propose CGP, a method to propagate information over a complete Cayley graph structure, thereby ensuring it is bottleneck-free to better alleviate over-squashing. Our empirical evidence across several real-world datasets not only shows that CGP recovers significant improvements as compared to EGP, but it is also akin to or outperforms computationally complex graph rewiring techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Third Learning on Graphs Conference (LoG 2024), PMLR 269. 20 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

However, prior work in EDA has mainly focused on pretraining models for digital circuits, overlooking analog and mixed-signal circuits. To bridge this gap, we introduce DICE, a Device-level Integrated Circuits Encoder, which is the first graph neural network (GNN) pretrained via self-supervised learning specifically tailored for graph-level prediction tasks in both analog and digital circuits. DICE adopts a simulation-free pretraining approach based on graph contrastive learning, leveraging two novel graph augmentation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements across three downstream tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of DICE for both analog and digital circuits.

We frame this problem as a self-supervised learning task and present several methods to generate graph alignment datasets using synthetic random graphs and real-world graph datasets from multiple domains. For a given graph dataset, we generate a family of graph alignment datasets with increasing difficulty, allowing us to rank the performance of various architectures. Our experiments indicate that anisotropic graph neural networks outperform standard convolutional architectures. To further demonstrate the utility of the graph alignment task, we show its effectiveness for unsupervised GNN pre-training, where the learned node embeddings outperform other positional encodings on three molecular regression tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results on the PCQM4Mv2 dataset with significantly fewer parameters. To support reproducibility and further research, we provide an open-source Python package to generate graph alignment datasets and benchmark new GNN architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Filtering Meets Spectrum Shift: Connecting User-Item Interaction with Graph-Structured Side Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08071v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in collaborative filtering, where the user-item (U-I) interaction bipartite graph serves as the fundamental data format. However, when graph-structured side information (e.g., multimodal similarity graphs or social networks) is integrated into the U-I bipartite graph, existing graph collaborative filtering methods fall short of achieving satisfactory performance. We quantitatively analyze this problem from a spectral perspective. Recall that a bipartite graph possesses a full spectrum within the range of [-1, 1], with the highest frequency exactly achievable at -1 and the lowest frequency at 1; however, we observe as more side information is incorporated, the highest frequency of the augmented adjacency matrix progressively shifts rightward. This spectrum shift phenomenon has caused previous approaches built for the full spectrum [-1, 1] to assign mismatched importance to different frequencies. To this end, we propose Spectrum Shift Correction (dubbed SSC), incorporating shifting and scaling factors to enable spectral GNNs to adapt to the shifted spectrum. Unlike previous paradigms of leveraging side information, which necessitate tailored designs for diverse data types, SSC directly connects traditional graph collaborative filtering with any graph-structured side information. Experiments on social and multimodal recommendation demonstrate the effectiveness of SSC, achieving relative improvements of up to 23% without incurring any additional computational overhead.

Existing brain network analysis methods primarily focus on graph-based models that rely solely on imaging data, which may overlook important non-imaging factors and limit the model's predictive power and interpretability. In this paper, we present BrainPrompt, an innovative framework that enhances Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge-driven prompts, enabling more effective capture of complex, non-imaging information and external knowledge for neurological disease identification. BrainPrompt integrates three types of knowledge-driven prompts: (1) ROI-level prompts to encode the identity and function of each brain region, (2) subject-level prompts that incorporate demographic information, and (3) disease-level prompts to capture the temporal progression of disease. By leveraging these multi-level prompts, BrainPrompt effectively harnesses knowledge-enhanced multi-modal information from LLMs, enhancing the model's capability to predict neurological disease stages and meanwhile offers more interpretable results. We evaluate BrainPrompt on two resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets from neurological disorders, showing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a biomarker study demonstrates the framework's ability to extract valuable and interpretable information aligned with domain knowledge in neuroscience.

However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{CROSS}, a flexible framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. CROSS is designed by decomposing the TTAG modeling process into two phases: (i) temporal semantics extraction; and (ii) semantic-structural information unification. The key idea is to advance the large language models (LLMs) to dynamically extract the temporal semantics in text space and then generate cohesive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the CROSS framework, which empowers LLMs to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that CROSS achieves state-of-the-art results on four public datasets and one industrial dataset, with 24.7% absolute MRR gain on average in temporal link prediction and 3.7% AUC gain in node classification of industrial application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to NeurIPS2025</p></details> |
| **[Power Allocation for Delay Optimization in Device-to-Device Networks: A Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12902v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of rate maximization in wireless communication frequently encounters substantial challenges associated with user fairness. This paper addresses these challenges by exploring a novel power allocation approach for delay optimization, utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs)-based reinforcement learning (RL) in device-to-device (D2D) communication. The proposed approach incorporates not only channel state information but also factors such as packet delay, the number of backlogged packets, and the number of transmitted packets into the components of the state information. We adopt a centralized RL method, where a central controller collects and processes the state information. The central controller functions as an agent trained using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. To better utilize topology information in the communication network and enhance the generalization of the proposed method, we embed GNN layers into both the actor and critic networks of the PPO algorithm. This integration allows for efficient parameter updates of GNNs and enables the state information to be parameterized as a low-dimensional embedding, which is leveraged by the agent to optimize power allocation strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces average delay while ensuring user fairness, outperforms baseline methods, and exhibits scalability and generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

Here we build a neural network that is equivariant under general conformal transformations. To achieve this, we lift data from flat Euclidean space to Anti de Sitter (AdS) space. This allows us to exploit a known correspondence between conformal transformations of flat space and isometric transformations on the AdS space. We then build upon the fact that such isometric transformations have been extensively studied on general geometries in the geometric deep learning literature. We employ message-passing layers conditioned on the proper distance, yielding a computationally efficient framework. We validate our model on tasks from computer vision and statistical physics, demonstrating strong performance, improved generalization capacities, and the ability to extract conformal data such as scaling dimensions from the trained network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Multi-Party Dialogue Framework with Speaker-ware Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11292v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-party dialogues, common in collaborative scenarios like brainstorming sessions and negotiations, pose significant challenges due to their complexity and diverse speaker roles. Current methods often use graph neural networks to model dialogue context, capturing structural dynamics but heavily relying on annotated graph structures and overlooking individual speaking styles. To address these challenges, we propose CMR, a Contrastive learning-based Multi-party dialogue Response generation framework. CMR employs a two-stage self-supervised contrastive learning framework. First, it captures global differences in speaking styles across individuals. Then, it focuses on intra-conversation comparisons to identify thematic transitions and contextually relevant facts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that applies contrastive learning in multi-party dialogue generation. Experimental results demonstrate that CMR not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, but also generalizes well to large pre-trained language models, effectively enhancing their capability in handling multi-party conversations.</p></details> |  |

Existing graph domain adaptation (graph DA) methods often implicitly assume a \textit{mild} shift between source and target graphs, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with \textit{large} shifts. Gradual domain adaptation (GDA) has emerged as a promising approach for addressing large shifts by gradually adapting the source model to the target domain via a path of unlabeled intermediate domains. Existing GDA methods exclusively focus on independent and identically distributed (IID) data with a predefined path, leaving their extension to \textit{non-IID graphs without a given path} an open challenge. To bridge this gap, we present Gadget, the first GDA framework for non-IID graph data. First (\textit{theoretical foundation}), the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance is adopted as the domain discrepancy for non-IID graphs, based on which, we derive an error bound revealing that the target domain error is proportional to the length of the path. Second (\textit{optimal path}), guided by the error bound, we identify the FGW geodesic as the optimal path, which can be efficiently generated by our proposed algorithm. The generated path can be seamlessly integrated with existing graph DA methods to handle large shifts on graphs, improving state-of-the-art graph DA methods by up to 6.8\% in node classification accuracy on real-world datasets.</p></details> | 27 pages, 10 figures |

Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps: (1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance. Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that~\methodname~outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Graph Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12614v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph unlearning, which deletes graph elements such as nodes and edges from trained graph neural networks (GNNs), is crucial for real-world applications where graph data may contain outdated, inaccurate, or privacy-sensitive information. However, existing methods often suffer from (1) incomplete or over unlearning due to neglecting the distinct objectives of different unlearning tasks, and (2) inaccurate identification of neighbors affected by deleted elements across various GNN architectures. To address these limitations, we propose AGU, a novel Adaptive Graph Unlearning framework that flexibly adapts to diverse unlearning tasks and GNN architectures. AGU ensures the complete forgetting of deleted elements while preserving the integrity of the remaining graph. It also accurately identifies affected neighbors for each GNN architecture and prioritizes important ones to enhance unlearning performance. Extensive experiments on seven real-world graphs demonstrate that AGU outperforms existing methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and unlearning capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

Although numerous detection methods have been developed to differentiate between machine-generated texts (MGT) and human-generated texts (HGT), the explainability of these methods remains a significant gap. Traditional explainability techniques often fall short in capturing the complex word relationships that distinguish HGT from MGT. To address this limitation, we present LM$^2$otifs, a novel explainable framework for MGT detection. Inspired by probabilistic graphical models, we provide a theoretical rationale for the effectiveness. LM$^2$otifs utilizes eXplainable Graph Neural Networks to achieve both accurate detection and interpretability. The LM$^2$otifs pipeline operates in three key stages: first, it transforms text into graphs based on word co-occurrence to represent lexical dependencies; second, graph neural networks are used for prediction; and third, a post-hoc explainability method extracts interpretable motifs, offering multi-level explanations from individual words to sentence structures. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the comparable performance of LM$^2$otifs. The empirical evaluation of the extracted explainable motifs confirms their effectiveness in differentiating HGT and MGT. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals distinct and visible linguistic fingerprints characteristic of MGT.</p></details> |  |

In the case of graph classification, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques address this major issue by identifying sub-graph motifs that explain predictions. However, advancements in this field are hindered by a chronic scarcity of benchmark datasets with known ground-truth motifs to assess the explanations' quality. Current graph XAI benchmarks are limited to synthetic data or a handful of real-world tasks hand-curated by domain experts. In this paper, we propose a general method to automate the construction of XAI benchmarks for graph classification from real-world datasets. We provide both 15 ready-made benchmarks, as well as the code to generate more than 2000 additional XAI benchmarks with our method. As a use case, we employ our benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of some popular graph explainers.</p></details> |  |

While this challenge is commonly addressed with specialized GNN architectures, graph rewiring remains an underexplored strategy in this context. We provide theoretical foundations linking edge homophily, GNN embedding smoothness, and node classification performance, motivating the need to enhance homophily. Building on this insight, we introduce a rewiring framework that increases graph homophily using a reference graph, with theoretical guarantees on the homophily of the rewired graph. To broaden applicability, we propose a label-driven diffusion approach for constructing a homophilic reference graph from node features and training labels. Through extensive simulations, we analyze how the homophily of both the original and reference graphs influences the rewired graph homophily and downstream GNN performance. We evaluate our method on 11 real-world heterophilic datasets and show that it outperforms existing rewiring techniques and specialized GNNs for heterophilic graphs, achieving improved node classification accuracy while remaining efficient and scalable to large graphs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-Order Graphon Neural Networks: Approximation and Cut Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14338v3)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph limit models, like graphons for limits of dense graphs, have recently been used to study size transferability of graph neural networks (GNNs). While most literature focuses on message passing GNNs (MPNNs), in this work we attend to the more powerful higher-order GNNs. First, we extend the $k$-WL test for graphons (B\"oker, 2023) to the graphon-signal space and introduce signal-weighted homomorphism densities as a key tool. As an exemplary focus, we generalize Invariant Graph Networks (IGNs) to graphons, proposing Invariant Graphon Networks (IWNs) defined via a subset of the IGN basis corresponding to bounded linear operators. Even with this restricted basis, we show that IWNs of order $k$ are at least as powerful as the $k$-WL test, and we establish universal approximation results for graphon-signals in $L^p$ distances. This significantly extends the prior work of Cai & Wang (2022), showing that IWNs--a subset of their IGN-small--retain effectively the same expressivity as the full IGN basis in the limit. In contrast to their approach, our blueprint of IWNs also aligns better with the geometry of graphon space, for example facilitating comparability to MPNNs. We highlight that, while typical higher-order GNNs are discontinuous w.r.t. cut distance--which causes their lack of convergence and is inherently tied to the definition of $k$-WL--transferability remains achievable.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

However, most existing approaches are ill-suited for large-scale and dynamically evolving graphs, as they often require complete re-learning of the structure upon the arrival of new nodes and incur substantial computational and memory costs. In this work, we propose GraphFLEx: a unified and scalable framework for Graph Structure Learning in Large and Expanding Graphs. GraphFLEx mitigates the scalability bottlenecks by restricting edge formation to structurally relevant subsets of nodes identified through a combination of clustering and coarsening techniques. This dramatically reduces the search space and enables efficient, incremental graph updates. The framework supports 48 flexible configurations by integrating diverse choices of learning paradigms, coarsening strategies, and clustering methods, making it adaptable to a wide range of graph settings and learning objectives. Extensive experiments across 26 diverse datasets and Graph Neural Network architectures demonstrate that GraphFLEx achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved scalability.</p></details> |  |

Most existing semi-supervised community detection algorithms detect communities based on known ones, and the detected communities typically do not contain the given query node. Therefore, they are not suitable for searching the community of a given node. Motivated by this, we adopt this paradigm into the semi-supervised community search for the first time and propose Pre-trained Prompt-driven Community Search (PPCS), a novel model designed to enhance search accuracy and efficiency. PPCS consists of three main components: node encoding, sample generation, and prompt-driven fine-tuning. Specifically, the node encoding component employs graph neural networks to learn local structural patterns of nodes in a graph, thereby obtaining representations for nodes and communities. Next, the sample generation component identifies an initial community for a given node and selects known communities that are structurally similar to the initial one as training samples. Finally, the prompt-driven fine-tuning component leverages these samples as prompts to guide the final community prediction. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that PPCS performs better than baseline algorithms. It also achieves higher community search efficiency than semi-supervised community search baseline methods, with ablation studies verifying the effectiveness of each component of PPCS.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

We introduce the notion of average velocity to characterize flow fields, in contrast to instantaneous velocity modeled by Flow Matching methods. A well-defined identity between average and instantaneous velocities is derived and used to guide neural network training. Our method, termed the MeanFlow model, is self-contained and requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning. MeanFlow demonstrates strong empirical performance: it achieves an FID of 3.43 with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet 256x256 trained from scratch, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art one-step diffusion/flow models. Our study substantially narrows the gap between one-step diffusion/flow models and their multi-step predecessors, and we hope it will motivate future research to revisit the foundations of these powerful models.</p></details> | Tech report |

For instance, generating gymnastics routines such as "switch leap with 0.5 turn" poses substantial difficulties for current methods, often yielding unsatisfactory results. To bridge this gap, we propose FinePhys, a Fine-grained human action generation framework that incorporates Physics to obtain effective skeletal guidance. Specifically, FinePhys first estimates 2D poses in an online manner and then performs 2D-to-3D dimension lifting via in-context learning. To mitigate the instability and limited interpretability of purely data-driven 3D poses, we further introduce a physics-based motion re-estimation module governed by Euler-Lagrange equations, calculating joint accelerations via bidirectional temporal updating. The physically predicted 3D poses are then fused with data-driven ones, offering multi-scale 2D heatmap guidance for the diffusion process. Evaluated on three fine-grained action subsets from FineGym (FX-JUMP, FX-TURN, and FX-SALTO), FinePhys significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Comprehensive qualitative results further demonstrate FinePhys's ability to generate more natural and plausible fine-grained human actions.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Generally speaking, two families of techniques have emerged for solving this problem for gradient-based guidance: namely, posterior guidance (i.e., guidance via projecting the current sample to the target distribution via the target prediction model) and end-to-end guidance (i.e., guidance by performing backpropagation throughout the entire ODE solve). In this work, we show that these two seemingly separate families can actually be unified by looking at posterior guidance as a greedy strategy of end-to-end guidance. We explore the theoretical connections between these two families and provide an in-depth theoretical of these two techniques relative to the continuous ideal gradients. Motivated by this analysis we then show a method for interpolating between these two families enabling a trade-off between compute and accuracy of the guidance gradients. We then validate this work on several inverse image problems and property-guided molecular generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised preprint with numerical experiments</p></details> |
| **[A Practical Guide for Incorporating Symmetry in Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13431v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, equivariant neural networks for policy learning have shown promising improvements in sample efficiency and generalization, however, their wide adoption faces substantial barriers due to implementation complexity. Equivariant architectures typically require specialized mathematical formulations and custom network design, posing significant challenges when integrating with modern policy frameworks like diffusion-based models. In this paper, we explore a number of straightforward and practical approaches to incorporate symmetry benefits into diffusion policies without the overhead of full equivariant designs. Specifically, we investigate (i) invariant representations via relative trajectory actions and eye-in-hand perception, (ii) integrating equivariant vision encoders, and (iii) symmetric feature extraction with pretrained encoders using Frame Averaging. We first prove that combining eye-in-hand perception with relative or delta action parameterization yields inherent SE(3)-invariance, thus improving policy generalization. We then perform a systematic experimental study on those design choices for integrating symmetry in diffusion policies, and conclude that an invariant representation with equivariant feature extraction significantly improves the policy performance. Our method achieves performance on par with or exceeding fully equivariant architectures while greatly simplifying implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-tuning Quantized Neural Networks with Zeroth-order Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13430v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the size of large language models grows exponentially, GPU memory has become a bottleneck for adapting these models to downstream tasks. In this paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a novel approach that perturbs the continuous quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to full-parameter fine-tuning in bfloat16, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by more than 18$\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B and Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large within a single 24GB GPU.</p></details> |  |

In VSA, a lightweight coarse stage pools tokens into tiles and identifies high-weight \emph{critical tokens}; a fine stage computes token-level attention only inside those tiles subjecting to block computing layout to ensure hard efficiency. This leads to a single differentiable kernel that trains end-to-end, requires no post-hoc profiling, and sustains 85\% of FlashAttention3 MFU. We perform a large sweep of ablation studies and scaling-law experiments by pretraining DiTs from 60M to 1.4B parameters. VSA reaches a Pareto point that cuts training FLOPS by 2.53$\times$ with no drop in diffusion loss. Retrofitting the open-source Wan-2.1 model speeds up attention time by 6$\times$ and lowers end-to-end generation time from 31s to 18s with comparable quality. These results establish trainable sparse attention as a practical alternative to full attention and a key enabler for further scaling of video diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Restoration Score Distillation: From Corrupted Diffusion Pretraining to One-Step High-Quality Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13377v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning generative models from corrupted data is a fundamental yet persistently challenging task across scientific disciplines, particularly when access to clean data is limited or expensive. Denoising Score Distillation (DSD) \cite{chen2025denoising} recently introduced a novel and surprisingly effective strategy that leverages score distillation to train high-fidelity generative models directly from noisy observations. Building upon this foundation, we propose \textit{Restoration Score Distillation} (RSD), a principled generalization of DSD that accommodates a broader range of corruption types, such as blurred, incomplete, or low-resolution images. RSD operates by first pretraining a teacher diffusion model solely on corrupted data and subsequently distilling it into a single-step generator that produces high-quality reconstructions. Empirically, RSD consistently surpasses its teacher model across diverse restoration tasks on both natural and scientific datasets. Moreover, beyond standard diffusion objectives, the RSD framework is compatible with several corruption-aware training techniques such as Ambient Tweedie, Ambient Diffusion, and its Fourier-space variant, enabling flexible integration with recent advances in diffusion modeling. Theoretically, we demonstrate that in a linear regime, RSD recovers the eigenspace of the clean data covariance matrix from linear measurements, thereby serving as an implicit regularizer. This interpretation recasts score distillation not only as a sampling acceleration technique but as a principled approach to enhancing generative performance in severely degraded data regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimum-Excess-Work Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13375v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a regularization framework inspired by thermodynamic work for guiding pre-trained probability flow generative models (e.g., continuous normalizing flows or diffusion models) by minimizing excess work, a concept rooted in statistical mechanics and with strong conceptual connections to optimal transport. Our approach enables efficient guidance in sparse-data regimes common to scientific applications, where only limited target samples or partial density constraints are available. We introduce two strategies: Path Guidance for sampling rare transition states by concentrating probability mass on user-defined subsets, and Observable Guidance for aligning generated distributions with experimental observables while preserving entropy. We demonstrate the framework's versatility on a coarse-grained protein model, guiding it to sample transition configurations between folded/unfolded states and correct systematic biases using experimental data. The method bridges thermodynamic principles with modern generative architectures, offering a principled, efficient, and physics-inspired alternative to standard fine-tuning in data-scarce domains. Empirical results highlight improved sample efficiency and bias reduction, underscoring its applicability to molecular simulations and beyond.</p></details> | 30 pages, 18 figures |

Explicit flux functions engineered to conserve entropy are introduced within the finite-volume framework. Further, discrete kinetic energy conservation too is introduced. A systematic inquiry is presented, commencing with an overview of numerical entropy conservation and formulation of entropy-conserving and kinetic energy-preserving fluxes, followed by the study of their properties and efficacy. A novelty introduced is to associate numerical entropy conservation to the discretization of the energy conservation equation. Furthermore, an entropy-stable shock-capturing diffusion method and a hybrid approach utilizing the entropy distance to manage smooth regions effectively are also introduced. The addition of artificial viscosity in appropriate regions ensures entropy generation sufficient to prevent numerical instabilities. Various test cases, showcasing the efficacy and stability of the proposed methodology, are presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Step Offline Distillation of Diffusion-based Models via Koopman Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13358v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional performance, yet their iterative sampling procedures remain computationally expensive. A prominent strategy to mitigate this cost is distillation, with offline distillation offering particular advantages in terms of efficiency, modularity, and flexibility. In this work, we identify two key observations that motivate a principled distillation framework: (1) while diffusion models have been viewed through the lens of dynamical systems theory, powerful and underexplored tools can be further leveraged; and (2) diffusion models inherently impose structured, semantically coherent trajectories in latent space. Building on these observations, we introduce the Koopman Distillation Model KDM, a novel offline distillation approach grounded in Koopman theory-a classical framework for representing nonlinear dynamics linearly in a transformed space. KDM encodes noisy inputs into an embedded space where a learned linear operator propagates them forward, followed by a decoder that reconstructs clean samples. This enables single-step generation while preserving semantic fidelity. We provide theoretical justification for our approach: (1) under mild assumptions, the learned diffusion dynamics admit a finite-dimensional Koopman representation; and (2) proximity in the Koopman latent space correlates with semantic similarity in the generated outputs, allowing for effective trajectory alignment. Empirically, KDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard offline distillation benchmarks, improving FID scores by up to 40% in a single generation step. All implementation details and code for the experimental setups are provided in our GitHub - https://github.com/azencot-group/KDM, or in our project page - https://sites.google.com/view/koopman-distillation-model.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisDiff: SDF-Guided Polygon Generation for Visibility Reconstruction and Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05530v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to capture rich representations of combinatorial structures has enabled the application of machine learning to tasks such as analysis and generation of floorplans, terrains, images, and animations. Recent work has primarily focused on understanding structures with well-defined features, neighborhoods, or underlying distance metrics, while those lacking such characteristics remain largely unstudied. Examples of these combinatorial structures can be found in polygons, where a small change in the vertex locations causes a significant rearrangement of the combinatorial structure, expressed as a visibility or triangulation graphs. Current representation learning approaches fail to capture structures without well-defined features and distance metrics. In this paper, we study the open problem of Visibility Reconstruction: Given a visibility graph $G$, construct a polygon $P$ whose visibility graph is $G$. We introduce VisDiff, a novel diffusion-based approach to generate polygon $P$ from the input visibility graph $G$. The main novelty of our approach is that, rather than generating the polygon's vertex set directly, we first estimate the signed distance function (SDF) associated with the polygon. The SDF is then used to extract the vertex location representing the final polygon. We show that going through the SDF allows VisDiff to learn the visibility relationship much more effectively than generating vertex locations directly. In order to train VisDiff, we create a carefully curated dataset. We use this dataset to benchmark our method and achieve 26% improvement in F1-Score over standard methods as well as state of the art approaches.</p></details> |  |

We first extract dense optical flow from a reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform, projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency artifacts. Experiments on benchmarks reveal that RoPECraft outperforms all recently published methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://berkegokmen1.github.io/RoPECraft/</p></details> |

However, existing techniques mainly focus on high-fidelity reconstruction, requiring many bits for compression. This paper proposes a "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model" (DDPM) architecture for point cloud compression (DDPM-PCC) at low bit-rates. A PointNet encoder produces the condition vector for the generation, which is then quantized via a learnable vector quantizer. This configuration allows to achieve a low bitrates while preserving quality. Experiments on ShapeNet and ModelNet40 show improved rate-distortion at low rates compared to standardized and state-of-the-art approaches.

The removal of adversarial perturbations at inference time, known as adversarial purification, has emerged as a promising defense strategy. To achieve this, state-of-the-art methods leverage diffusion models that inject Gaussian noise during a forward process to dilute adversarial perturbations, followed by a denoising step to restore clean samples before classification. In this work, we propose FlowPure, a novel purification method based on Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) trained with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to learn mappings from adversarial examples to their clean counterparts. Unlike prior diffusion-based approaches that rely on fixed noise processes, FlowPure can leverage specific attack knowledge to improve robustness under known threats, while also supporting a more general stochastic variant trained on Gaussian perturbations for settings where such knowledge is unavailable. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art purification-based defenses in preprocessor-blind and white-box scenarios, and can do so while fully preserving benign accuracy in the former. Moreover, our results show that not only is FlowPure a highly effective purifier but it also holds a strong potential for adversarial detection, identifying preprocessor-blind PGD samples with near-perfect accuracy.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Epistemic Mixture of Experts (EMoE), a novel framework for efficiently estimating epistemic uncertainty in diffusion models. EMoE leverages pre-trained networks without requiring additional training, enabling direct uncertainty estimation from a prompt. We leverage a latent space within the diffusion process that captures epistemic uncertainty better than existing methods. Experimental results on the COCO dataset demonstrate EMoE's effectiveness, showing a strong correlation between uncertainty and image quality. Additionally, EMoE identifies under-sampled languages and regions with higher uncertainty, revealing hidden biases in the training set. This capability demonstrates the relevance of EMoE as a tool for addressing fairness and accountability in AI-generated content.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods rely on CNNs and Transformers, but CNNs struggle to capture global dependencies, and Transformers are computationally expensive, which limits their effectiveness in remote applications. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising solution in the field of computer vision, offering a linear complexity for modeling global dependencies. To this end, we propose Mamba-MOC, a mamba-based network designed for multi-category remote object counting, which represents the first application of Mamba to remote sensing object counting. Specifically, we propose a cross-scale interaction module to facilitate the deep integration of hierarchical features. Then we design a context state space model to capture both global and local contextual information and provide local neighborhood information during the scan process. Experimental results in large-scale realistic scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with some mainstream counting algorithms.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are constrained to basic instruction-following or descriptive tasks, facing challenges in complex real-world remote sensing applications that require specialized tools and knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose RS-Agent, an AI agent designed to interact with human users and autonomously leverage specialized models to address the demands of real-world remote sensing applications. RS-Agent integrates four key components: a Central Controller based on large language models, a dynamic toolkit for tool execution, a Solution Space for task-specific expert guidance, and a Knowledge Space for domain-level reasoning, enabling it to interpret user queries and orchestrate tools for accurate remote sensing task. We introduce two novel mechanisms: Task-Aware Retrieval, which improves tool selection accuracy through expert-guided planning, and DualRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation method that enhances knowledge relevance through weighted, dual-path retrieval. RS-Agent supports flexible integration of new tools and is compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets and 18 remote sensing tasks demonstrate that RS-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs, achieving over 95% task planning accuracy and delivering superior performance in tasks such as scene classification, object counting, and remote sensing visual question answering. Our work presents RS-Agent as a robust and extensible framework for advancing intelligent automation in remote sensing analysis.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in visual-spatial reasoning, most studies focus on standard pinhole-view images, leaving omnidirectional perception largely unexplored. In this paper, we ask: Are MLLMs ready for omnidirectional spatial reasoning? To investigate this, we introduce OSR-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed for this setting. OSR-Bench includes over 153,000 diverse question-answer pairs grounded in high-fidelity panoramic indoor scene maps. It covers key reasoning types including object counting, relative distance, and direction. We also propose a negative sampling strategy that inserts non-existent objects into prompts to evaluate hallucination and grounding robustness. For fine-grained analysis, we design a two-stage evaluation framework assessing both cognitive map generation and QA accuracy using rotation-invariant matching and a combination of rule-based and LLM-based metrics. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and leading open-source models under zero-shot settings. Results show that current models struggle with spatial reasoning in panoramic contexts, highlighting the need for more perceptually grounded MLLMs. OSR-Bench and code will be released at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/UUUserna/OSR-Bench</p></details> |  |

Consequently, we are witnessing growing interests in integrating additional structural constraints, typically in the form of coarse bounding boxes, to better guide the generation process in such challenging cases. In this work, we take the idea of structural guidance a step further by making the observation that contemporary image generation models can directly provide a plausible fine-grained structural initialization. We propose a technique that couples this image-based structural guidance with LLM-based instance-level instructions, yielding output images that adhere to all parts of the text prompt, including object counts, instance-level attributes, and spatial relations between instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH 2025.

Despite progress in computer vision, existing benchmarks reveal significant gaps in models' abilities to accurately recognize object attributes and reason about spatial relationships, both essential for dynamic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose MIRAGE, a multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate models' capabilities in Counting (object attribute recognition), Relation (spatial relational reasoning), and Counting with Relation. Through diverse and complex scenarios requiring fine-grained recognition and reasoning, MIRAGE highlights critical limitations in state-of-the-art models, underscoring the need for improved representations and reasoning frameworks. By targeting these foundational abilities, MIRAGE provides a pathway toward spatiotemporal reasoning in future research.</p></details> |  |

Recent video editing approaches primarily fall into two categories: training-required and training-free methods. While training-based methods incur high computational costs, training-free alternatives often yield suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose DAPE, a high-quality yet cost-effective two-stage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework for video editing. In the first stage, we design an efficient norm-tuning method to enhance temporal consistency in generated videos. The second stage introduces a vision-friendly adapter to improve visual quality. Additionally, we identify critical shortcomings in existing benchmarks, including limited category diversity, imbalanced object distribution, and inconsistent frame counts. To mitigate these issues, we curate a large dataset benchmark comprising 232 videos with rich annotations and 6 editing prompts, enabling objective and comprehensive evaluation of advanced methods. Extensive experiments on existing datasets (BalanceCC, LOVEU-TGVE, RAVE) and our proposed benchmark demonstrate that DAPE significantly improves temporal coherence and text-video alignment while outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose CountDiffusion, a training-free framework aiming at generating images with correct object quantity from textual descriptions. CountDiffusion consists of two stages. In the first stage, an intermediate denoising result is generated by the diffusion model to predict the final synthesized image with one-step denoising, and a counting model is used to count the number of objects in this image. In the second stage, a correction module is used to correct the object quantity by changing the attention map of the object with universal guidance. The proposed CountDiffusion can be plugged into any diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation models without further training. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CountDiffusion, which improves the accurate object quantity generation ability of T2I models by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

While unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are commonly used for indoor farm monitoring, their deployment in greenhouses is often constrained by infrastructure limitations, sensor placement challenges, and operational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we develop a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB-D camera, a 3D LiDAR, and an IMU sensor. The UAV employs a LiDAR-inertial odometry algorithm for precise navigation in GNSS-denied environments and utilizes a 3D multi-object tracking algorithm to estimate the count and weight of cherry tomatoes. We evaluate the system using two dataset: one from a harvesting row and another from a growing row. In the harvesting-row dataset, the proposed system achieves 94.4\% counting accuracy and 87.5\% weight estimation accuracy within a 13.2-meter flight completed in 10.5 seconds. For the growing-row dataset, which consists of occluded unripened fruits, we qualitatively analyze tracking performance and highlight future research directions for improving perception in greenhouse with strong occlusions.

This might be partially the result of the fact that Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT), a critical training step for MLLMs, has traditionally focused on scaling data volume, but not the compositional complexity of training examples. We propose COMPACT (COMPositional Atomic-to-complex visual Capability Tuning), which generates a training dataset explicitly controlling for the compositional complexity of the training examples. The data from COMPACT allows MLLMs to train on combinations of atomic capabilities to learn complex capabilities more efficiently. Across all benchmarks, COMPACT achieves comparable performance to the LLaVA-665k VIT while using less than 10% of its data budget, and even outperforms it on several, especially those involving complex multi-capability tasks. For example, COMPACT achieves substantial 83.3% improvement on MMStar and 94.0% improvement on MM-Vet compared to the full-scale VIT on particularly complex questions that require four or more atomic capabilities. COMPACT offers a scalable, data-efficient, visual compositional tuning recipe to improve on complex visual-language tasks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |

While prior studies suggest that different CLIP-ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, most MLLMs still select visual features based on empirical heuristics rather than systematic analysis. In this work, we propose a Layer-wise Representation Similarity approach to group CLIP-ViT layers with similar behaviors into {shallow, middle, and deep} categories and assess their impact on MLLM performance. Building on this foundation, we revisit the visual layer selection problem in MLLMs at scale, training LLaVA-style models ranging from 1.4B to 7B parameters. Through extensive experiments across 10 datasets and 4 tasks, we find that: (1) deep layers are essential for OCR tasks; (2) shallow and middle layers substantially outperform deep layers on reasoning tasks involving counting, positioning, and object localization; (3) a lightweight fusion of features across shallow, middle, and deep layers consistently outperforms specialized fusion baselines and single-layer selections, achieving gains on 9 out of 10 datasets. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, laying the groundwork for deeper investigations into visual representation learning for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Unlike humans, who effortlessly identify and count objects from diverse categories without prior knowledge, most existing counting methods are restricted to enumerating instances of known classes, requiring extensive labeled datasets for training and struggling in open-vocabulary settings. In contrast, CAC aims to count objects belonging to classes never seen during training, operating in a few-shot setting. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive review of CAC methodologies. We propose a taxonomy to categorize CAC approaches into three paradigms based on how target object classes can be specified: reference-based, reference-less, and open-world text-guided. Reference-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance by relying on exemplar-guided mechanisms. Reference-less methods eliminate exemplar dependency by leveraging inherent image patterns. Finally, open-world text-guided methods use vision-language models, enabling object class descriptions via textual prompts, offering a flexible and promising solution. Based on this taxonomy, we provide an overview of the architectures of 29 CAC approaches and report their results on gold-standard benchmarks. We compare their performance and discuss their strengths and limitations. Specifically, we present results on the FSC-147 dataset, setting a leaderboard using gold-standard metrics, and on the CARPK dataset to assess generalization capabilities. Finally, we offer a critical discussion of persistent challenges, such as annotation dependency and generalization, alongside future directions. We believe this survey will be a valuable resource, showcasing CAC advancements and guiding future research.</p></details> |  |

Different from previous works that are limited to singulating them using suction cups or soft grippers, RoTipBot can count multiple layers and then grasp them simultaneously in a single grasp closure. Specifically, we first develop a vision-based tactile sensor named RoTip that can rotate and sense contact information around its tip. Equipped with two RoTip sensors, RoTipBot rolls and feeds multiple layers of thin, flexible objects into the centre between its fingers, enabling effective grasping. Moreover, we design a tactile-based grasping strategy that uses RoTip's sensing ability to ensure both fingers maintain secure contact with the object while accurately counting the number of fed objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the RoTip sensor and the RoTipBot approach. The results show that RoTipBot not only achieves a higher success rate but also grasps and counts multiple layers simultaneously -- capabilities not possible with previous methods. Furthermore, RoTipBot operates up to three times faster than state-of-the-art methods. The success of RoTipBot paves the way for future research in object manipulation using mobilised tactile sensors.

| **[SDVPT: Semantic-Driven Visual Prompt Tuning for Open-World Object Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17395v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-world object counting leverages the robust text-image alignment of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to enable counting of arbitrary categories in images specified by textual queries. However, widely adopted naive fine-tuning strategies concentrate exclusively on text-image consistency for categories contained in training, which leads to limited generalizability for unseen categories. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play Semantic-Driven Visual Prompt Tuning framework (SDVPT) that transfers knowledge from the training set to unseen categories with minimal overhead in parameters and inference time. First, we introduce a two-stage visual prompt learning strategy composed of Category-Specific Prompt Initialization (CSPI) and Topology-Guided Prompt Refinement (TGPR). The CSPI generates category-specific visual prompts, and then TGPR distills latent structural patterns from the VLM's text encoder to refine these prompts. During inference, we dynamically synthesize the visual prompts for unseen categories based on the semantic correlation between unseen and training categories, facilitating robust text-image alignment for unseen categories. Extensive experiments integrating SDVPT with all available open-world object counting models demonstrate its effectiveness and adaptability across three widely used datasets: FSC-147, CARPK, and PUCPR+.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPTURe: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Occluded Object Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15485v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty counting in images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/atinpothiraj/CAPTURe</p></details> |

We propose instead an estimation-based version of the problem: we label Rough Crowd Counting that delivers better accuracy on the basis of training data that is easier to acquire. Rough crowd counting requires only rough annotations of the number of targets in an image, instead of the more traditional, and far more expensive, per-target annotations. We propose an approach to the rough crowd counting problem based on CLIP, termed ProgRoCC. Specifically, we introduce a progressive estimation learning strategy that determines the object count through a coarse-to-fine approach. This approach delivers answers quickly, outperforms the state-of-the-art in semi- and weakly-supervised crowd counting. In addition, we design a vision-language matching adapter that optimizes key-value pairs by mining effective matches of two modalities to refine the visual features, thereby improving the final performance. Extensive experimental results on three widely adopted crowd counting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | Under review |

Existing approaches often rely on large-scale external reasoning modules or elaborate pipeline designs, hindering practical deployment and interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Logical Anomaly Detection (RLAD), which extends traditional anomaly detection by incorporating logical reasoning. We propose a new framework, LAD-Reasoner, a customized tiny multimodal language model built on Qwen2.5-VL 3B. Our approach leverages a two-stage training paradigm that first employs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for fine-grained visual understanding, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine logical anomaly detection and enforce coherent, human-readable reasoning. Crucially, reward signals are derived from both the detection accuracy and the structural quality of the outputs, obviating the need for building chain of thought (CoT) reasoning data. Experiments on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset show that LAD-Reasoner, though significantly smaller, matches the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B in accuracy and F1 score, and further excels in producing concise and interpretable rationales. This unified design reduces reliance on large models and complex pipelines, while offering transparent and interpretable insights into logical anomaly detection. Code and data will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Limits of Vision Language Models Through the Lens of the Binding Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00238v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has documented striking heterogeneity in the performance of state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), including both multimodal language models and text-to-image models. These models are able to describe and generate a diverse array of complex, naturalistic images, yet they exhibit surprising failures on basic multi-object reasoning tasks -- such as counting, localization, and simple forms of visual analogy -- that humans perform with near perfect accuracy. To better understand this puzzling pattern of successes and failures, we turn to theoretical accounts of the binding problem in cognitive science and neuroscience, a fundamental problem that arises when a shared set of representational resources must be used to represent distinct entities (e.g., to represent multiple objects in an image), necessitating the use of serial processing to avoid interference. We find that many of the puzzling failures of state-of-the-art VLMs can be explained as arising due to the binding problem, and that these failure modes are strikingly similar to the limitations exhibited by rapid, feedforward processing in the human brain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning What NOT to Count](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11705v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few/zero-shot object counting methods reduce the need for extensive annotations but often struggle to distinguish between fine-grained categories, especially when multiple similar objects appear in the same scene. To address this limitation, we propose an annotation-free approach that enables the seamless integration of new fine-grained categories into existing few/zero-shot counting models. By leveraging latent generative models, we synthesize high-quality, category-specific crowded scenes, providing a rich training source for adapting to new categories without manual labeling. Our approach introduces an attention prediction network that identifies fine-grained category boundaries trained using only synthetic pseudo-annotated data. At inference, these fine-grained attention estimates refine the output of existing few/zero-shot counting networks. To benchmark our method, we further introduce the FGTC dataset, a taxonomy-specific fine-grained object counting dataset for natural images. Our method substantially enhances pre-trained state-of-the-art models on fine-grained taxon counting tasks, while using only synthetic data. Code and data to be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Curation of these image-text pairs is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we introduce SVP (Sampling-based Visual Projection), a novel framework that enhances vision-language alignment without relying on manually curated text-image pairs or preference annotation. SVP leverages a small set of manually selected images, self-captioning and a pre-trained grounding model as a feedback mechanism to elicit latent information in VLMs. We evaluate our approach across six key areas: captioning, referring, visual question answering, multitasking, hallucination control, and object recall. Results demonstrate significant improvements, including a 14 % average improvement in captioning tasks, up to 12 % increase in object recall, and significantly reduced hallucinations, while maintaining question-answering capabilities. Using SVP, a small VLM achieves hallucination reductions similar to a model five times larger, while a VLM with initially poor referring capabilities more than doubles its performance, approaching parity with a model twice its size.</p></details> | Preprint |

To synthesise Colour Fundus Photographs (CFPs), existing methods primarily relying on predefined disease labels face significant limitations. However, current methods remain limited, thus failing to generate images for broader categories with diverse and fine-grained anatomical structures. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce an innovative pipeline that creates a large-scale, synthetic Caption-CFP dataset comprising 1.4 million entries, called RetinaLogos-1400k. Specifically, RetinaLogos-1400k uses large language models (LLMs) to describe retinal conditions and key structures, such as optic disc configuration, vascular distribution, nerve fibre layers, and pathological features. Furthermore, based on this dataset, we employ a novel three-step training framework, called RetinaLogos, which enables fine-grained semantic control over retinal images and accurately captures different stages of disease progression, subtle anatomical variations, and specific lesion types. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, with 62.07% of text-driven synthetic images indistinguishable from real ones by ophthalmologists. Moreover, the synthetic data improves accuracy by 10%-25% in diabetic retinopathy grading and glaucoma detection, thereby providing a scalable solution to augment ophthalmic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigate Language Priors in Large Vision-Language Models by Cross-Images Contrastive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10634v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language priors are a major cause of hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), often leading to text that is linguistically plausible but visually inconsistent. Recent work explores contrastive decoding as a training-free solution, but these methods typically construct negative visual contexts from the original image, resulting in visual information loss and distorted distribution. Motivated by the observation that language priors stem from the LLM backbone and remain consistent across images, we propose Cross-Images Contrastive Decoding (CICD), a simple yet effective training-free method that uses different images to construct negative visual contexts. We further analyze the cross-image behavior of language priors and introduce a distinction between essential priors (supporting fluency) and detrimental priors (causing hallucinations), enabling selective suppression. By selectively preserving essential priors and suppressing detrimental ones, our method reduces hallucinations while maintaining coherent and fluent language generation. Experiments on four benchmarks and six LVLMs across three model families confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of CICD, especially in image captioning, where language priors are particularly pronounced. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional hyperspectral imaging (HSI) datasets that focus solely on classification tasks, HyperCap integrates spectral data with pixel-wise textual annotations, enabling deeper semantic understanding of hyperspectral imagery. This dataset enhances model performance in tasks like classification and feature extraction, providing a valuable resource for advanced remote sensing applications. HyperCap is constructed from four benchmark datasets and annotated through a hybrid approach combining automated and manual methods to ensure accuracy and consistency. Empirical evaluations using state-of-the-art encoders and diverse fusion techniques demonstrate significant improvements in classification performance. These results underscore the potential of vision-language learning in HSI and position HyperCap as a foundational dataset for future research in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-LLaVA: Enhancing Large Language Models with Spatial Referring Expressions for Visual Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12194v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in comprehending visual input alongside text input. Typically, these models are trained on extensive data sourced from the internet, which are sufficient for general tasks such as scene understanding and question answering. However, they often underperform on specialized tasks where online data is scarce, such as determining spatial relationships between objects or localizing unique target objects within a group of objects sharing similar features. In response to this challenge, we introduce the SUN-Spot v2.0 dataset1, now comprising a total of 90k image-caption pairs and additional annotations on the landmark objects. Each image-caption pair utilizes Set-of-Marks prompting as an additional indicator, mapping each landmark object in the image to the corresponding object mentioned in the caption. Furthermore, we present Spatial-LLaVA, an MLLM trained on conversational data generated by a state-of-the-art language model using the SUNSpot v2.0 dataset. Our approach ensures a robust alignment between the objects in the images and their corresponding object mentions in the captions, enabling our model to learn spatial referring expressions without bias from the semantic information of the objects. Spatial-LLaVA outperforms previous methods by 3.15% on the zero-shot Visual Spatial Reasoning benchmark dataset. Spatial-LLaVA is specifically designed to precisely understand spatial referring expressions, making it highly applicable for tasks in real-world scenarios such as autonomous navigation and interactive robotics, where precise object recognition is critical.</p></details> |  |

Phrase grounding between images and their captions is a well-established task. In contrast, for real-world applications, it is essential to integrate textual and multimodal reference resolution to unravel the reference relations within dialogue, especially in handling ambiguities caused by pronouns and ellipses. This paper presents a framework that unifies textual and multimodal reference resolution by mapping mention embeddings to object embeddings and selecting mentions or objects based on their similarity. Our experiments show that learning textual reference resolution, such as coreference resolution and predicate-argument structure analysis, positively affects performance in multimodal reference resolution. In particular, our model with coreference resolution performs better in pronoun phrase grounding than representative models for this task, MDETR and GLIP. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates that incorporating textual reference relations strengthens the confidence scores between mentions, including pronouns and predicates, and objects, which can reduce the ambiguities that arise in visually grounded dialogues.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL20...</summary><p>ACL2025 main.

However, real-time interactive environments impose new demands on VLMs, requiring them to generate utterances that are not only semantically accurate but also precisely timed. We identify two core capabilities necessary for such settings -- $\textit{perceptual updating}$ and $\textit{contingency awareness}$ -- and propose a new benchmark task, $\textbf{Temporally-Grounded Language Generation (TGLG)}$, to evaluate them. TGLG requires models to generate utterances in response to streaming video such that both content and timing align with dynamic visual input. To support this benchmark, we curate evaluation datasets from sports broadcasting and egocentric human interaction domains, and introduce a new metric, $\textbf{TRACE}$, to evaluate TGLG by jointly measuring semantic similarity and temporal alignment. Finally, we present $\textbf{Vision-Language Model with Time-Synchronized Interleaving (VLM-TSI)}$, a model that interleaves visual and linguistic tokens in a time-synchronized manner, enabling real-time language generation without relying on turn-based assumptions. Experimental results show that VLM-TSI significantly outperforms a strong baseline, yet overall performance remains modest -- highlighting the difficulty of TGLG and motivating further research in real-time VLMs. Code and data available $\href{https://github.com/yukw777/tglg}{here}$.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Redundancy-Aware Pretraining of Vision-Language Foundation Models in Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11121v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of foundation models through pretraining of vision-language models (VLMs) has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). VLM pretraining aims to learn image and language alignments from a large number of image-text pairs. Each pretraining image is often associated with multiple captions containing redundant information due to repeated or semantically similar phrases, resulting in increased pretraining and inference time. To overcome this, we introduce a weighted feature aggregation (WFA) strategy for VLM pretraining in RS. Our strategy aims to extract and exploit complementary information from multiple captions per image while reducing redundancies through feature aggregation with importance weighting. To calculate adaptive importance weights for different captions of each image, we propose two techniques: (i) non-parametric uniqueness and (ii) learning-based attention. In the first technique, importance weights are calculated based on the bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores of the captions to emphasize unique sentences and reduce the influence of repetitive ones. In the second technique, importance weights are learned through an attention mechanism instead of relying on hand-crafted features. The effectiveness of the proposed WFA strategy with the two techniques is analyzed in terms of downstream performance on text-to-image retrieval in RS. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy enables efficient and effective pretraining of VLMs in RS. Based on the experimental analysis, we derive guidelines for selecting appropriate techniques depending on downstream task requirements and resource constraints.

To this end, we propose leveraging code as supervision for cross-modal alignment, since code inherently encodes all information needed to generate corresponding figures, establishing a precise connection between the two modalities. Specifically, we co-develop our image-to-code model and dataset with model-in-the-loop approach, resulting in an image-to-code model, FigCodifier and ImgCode-8.6M dataset, the largest image-code dataset to date. Furthermore, we utilize FigCodifier to synthesize novel mathematical figures and then construct MM-MathInstruct-3M, a high-quality multimodal math instruction fine-tuning dataset. Finally, we present MathCoder-VL, trained with ImgCode-8.6M for cross-modal alignment and subsequently fine-tuned on MM-MathInstruct-3M for multimodal math problem solving. Our model achieves a new open-source SOTA across all six metrics. Notably, it surpasses GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the geometry problem-solving subset of MathVista, achieving improvements of 8.9% and 9.2%.

In data-scarce settings, the quality of these pretrained models becomes crucial for effective transfer learning. Image classification and self-supervised learning have traditionally been the primary methods for pretraining CNNs and transformer-based architectures. Recently, the rise of text-to-image generative models, particularly those using denoising diffusion in a latent space, has introduced a new class of foundational models trained on massive, captioned image datasets. These models' ability to generate realistic images of unseen content suggests they possess a deep understanding of the visual world. In this work, we present Marigold, a family of conditional generative models and a fine-tuning protocol that extracts the knowledge from pretrained latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and adapts them for dense image analysis tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normals prediction, and intrinsic decomposition. Marigold requires minimal modification of the pre-trained latent diffusion model's architecture, trains with small synthetic datasets on a single GPU over a few days, and demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization.

We present PRIOR, a simple vision-language pre-training approach that addresses this issue by prioritizing image-related tokens through differential weighting in the NTP loss, drawing from the importance sampling framework. PRIOR introduces a reference model-a text-only large language model (LLM) trained on the captions without image inputs, to weight each token based on its probability for LVLMs training. Intuitively, tokens that are directly related to the visual inputs are harder to predict without the image and thus receive lower probabilities from the text-only reference LLM. During training, we implement a token-specific re-weighting term based on the importance scores to adjust each token's loss. We implement PRIOR in two distinct settings: LVLMs with visual encoders and LVLMs without visual encoders. We observe 19% and 8% average relative improvement, respectively, on several vision-language benchmarks compared to NTP. In addition, PRIOR exhibits superior scaling properties, as demonstrated by significantly higher scaling coefficients, indicating greater potential for performance gains compared to NTP given increasing compute and data.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code will be available at https://github.com/Yangyi-Chen/PRIOR</p></details> |

Their comprehension and reasoning capabilities enable promising applications in autonomous driving scenarios. However, existing research typically focuses on front-view perspectives and partial objects within scenes, struggling to achieve comprehensive scene understanding. Meanwhile, existing LVLMs suffer from the lack of mapping relationship between 2D and 3D and insufficient integration of 3D object localization and instruction understanding. To tackle these limitations, we first introduce NuInteract, a large-scale dataset with over 1.5M multi-view image language pairs spanning dense scene captions and diverse interactive tasks. Furthermore, we propose DriveMonkey, a simple yet effective framework that seamlessly integrates LVLMs with a spatial processor using a series of learnable queries. The spatial processor, designed as a plug-and-play component, can be initialized with pre-trained 3D detectors to improve 3D perception.

To address this, we propose Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), which enhances fine-grained understanding through three key innovations. First, we leverage large multimodal models to generate 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for capturing global-level semantic details. Second, a high-quality dataset is constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic differences. We construct a comprehensive dataset, termed FgGRN, by integrating high-quality region-specific annotations with challenging fine-grained negative samples. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks, including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection, image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks. These results highlight FG-CLIP's effectiveness in capturing fine-grained image details and improving overall model performance.

| **[Semantic and Expressive Variation in Image Captions Across Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14356v5)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer vision often treats human perception as homogeneous: an implicit assumption that visual stimuli are perceived similarly by everyone. This assumption is reflected in the way researchers collect datasets and train vision models. By contrast, literature in cross-cultural psychology and linguistics has provided evidence that people from different cultural backgrounds observe vastly different concepts even when viewing the same visual stimuli. In this paper, we study how these differences manifest themselves in vision-language datasets and models, using language as a proxy for culture. By comparing textual descriptions generated across 7 languages for the same images, we find significant differences in the semantic content and linguistic expression. When datasets are multilingual as opposed to monolingual, descriptions have higher semantic coverage on average, where coverage is measured using scene graphs, model embeddings, and linguistic taxonomies. For example, multilingual descriptions have on average 29.9% more objects, 24.5% more relations, and 46.0% more attributes than a set of monolingual captions. When prompted to describe images in different languages, popular models (e.g. LLaVA) inherit this bias and describe different parts of the image. Moreover, finetuning models on captions from one language performs best on corresponding test data from that language, while finetuning on multilingual data performs consistently well across all test data compositions. Our work points towards the need to account for and embrace the diversity of human perception in the computer vision community.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Mitigating Image Captioning Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03420v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in vision-language models (VLMs) hinder reliability and real-world applicability, usually stemming from distribution shifts between pretraining data and test samples. Existing solutions, such as retraining or fine-tuning on additional data, demand significant computational resources and labor-intensive data collection, while ensemble-based methods incur additional costs by introducing auxiliary VLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time adaptation framework using reinforcement learning to mitigate hallucinations during inference without retraining or any auxiliary VLMs. By updating only the learnable parameters in the layer normalization of the language model (approximately 0.003% of the model parameters), our method reduces distribution shifts between test samples and pretraining samples. A CLIP-based hallucination evaluation model is proposed to provide dual rewards to VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate a 15.4% and 17.3% reduction in hallucination rates on LLaVA and InstructBLIP, respectively. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a 68.3% improvement in hallucination mitigation, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Leaf Disease Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07019v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leaf disease identification plays a pivotal role in smart agriculture. However, many existing studies still struggle to integrate image and textual modalities to compensate for each other's limitations. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on pretraining with constrained datasets such as ImageNet, which lack domain-specific information. We propose SCOLD (Soft-target COntrastive learning for Leaf Disease identification), a context-aware vision-language foundation model tailored to address these challenges for agricultural tasks. SCOLD is developed using a diverse corpus of plant leaf images and corresponding symptom descriptions, comprising over 186,000 image-caption pairs aligned with 97 unique concepts. Through task-agnostic pretraining, SCOLD leverages contextual soft targets to mitigate overconfidence in contrastive learning by smoothing labels, thereby improving model generalization and robustness on fine-grained classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SCOLD outperforms existing vision-language models such as OpenAI-CLIP-L, BioCLIP, and SigLIP2 across several benchmarks, including zero-shot and few-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and image classification, while maintaining a competitive parameter footprint. Ablation studies further highlight SCOLD's effectiveness in contrast to its counterparts. The proposed approach significantly advances the agricultural vision-language foundation model, offering strong performance with minimal or no supervised fine-tuning. This work lays a solid groundwork for future research on models trained with long-form and simplified contexts, tasks involving class ambiguity, and multi-modal systems for intelligent plant disease diagnostics.

We examine the use of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to assess the likelihood of images and captions. We introduce \textit{Whitened CLIP}, a novel transformation of the CLIP latent space via an invertible linear operation. This transformation ensures that each feature in the embedding space has zero mean, unit standard deviation, and no correlation with all other features, resulting in an identity covariance matrix. We show that the whitened embeddings statistics can be well approximated as a standard normal distribution, thus, the log-likelihood is estimated simply by the square Euclidean norm in the whitened embedding space. The whitening procedure is completely training-free and performed using a pre-computed whitening matrix, hence, is very fast.

| **[Multi-modal Synthetic Data Training and Model Collapse: Insights from VLMs and Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08803v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has highlighted the risk of generative model collapse, where performance progressively degrades when continually trained on self-generated data. However, existing exploration on model collapse is limited to single, unimodal models, limiting our understanding in more realistic scenarios, such as diverse multi-modal AI agents interacting autonomously through synthetic data and continually evolving. We expand the synthetic data training and model collapse study to multi-modal vision-language generative systems, such as vision-language models (VLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models, as well as recursive generate-train loops with multiple models. We find that model collapse, previously observed in single-modality generative models, exhibits distinct characteristics in the multi-modal context, such as improved vision-language alignment and increased variance in VLM image-captioning task. Additionally, we find that general approaches such as increased decoding budgets, greater model diversity, and relabeling with frozen models can effectively mitigate model collapse. Our findings provide initial insights and practical guidelines for reducing the risk of model collapse in self-improving multi-agent AI systems and curating robust multi-modal synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on general image captioning, they often fail to capture the nuanced interpretations that fine art demands. We propose ArtRAG, a novel, training-free framework that combines structured knowledge with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multi-perspective artwork explanation. ArtRAG automatically constructs an Art Context Knowledge Graph (ACKG) from domain-specific textual sources, organizing entities such as artists, movements, themes, and historical events into a rich, interpretable graph. At inference time, a multi-granular structured retriever selects semantically and topologically relevant subgraphs to guide generation. This enables MLLMs to produce contextually grounded, culturally informed art descriptions. Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG outperforms several heavily trained baselines. Human evaluations further confirm that ArtRAG generates coherent, insightful, and culturally enriched interpretations.</p></details> |  |

In our setting, a speaker attempts to communicate some information to a listener in a single-turn dialogue and receives a reward if communicative success is achieved. Unlike earlier related work using image--caption data for interactive reference games, we operationalize communicative success in a more abstract language-only question--answering setting. First, we present a feasibility study demonstrating that our reward provides an indirect signal about grammaticality. Second, we conduct experiments using reinforcement learning to fine-tune language models. We observe that cognitively plausible constraints on the communication channel lead to interpretable changes in speaker behavior. However, we do not yet see improvements on linguistic evaluations from our training regime. We outline potential modifications to the task design and training configuration that could better position future work to use our methodology to observe the benefits of interaction on language learning in computational cognitive models.</p></details> |  |

To this end, the IG Parser employs a distinctive syntax that ensures rigorous encoding of natural language, while automating the transformation into various formats that support the downstream analysis using diverse analytical techniques. The conceptual core of the IG Parser is an associated syntax, IG Script, that operationalizes the conceptual foundations of the Institutional Grammar, and more specifically Institutional Grammar 2.0, an analytical paradigm for institutional analysis. This article presents the IG Parser, including its conceptual foundations, syntactic specification of IG Script, alongside architectural principles.

It also documents the related data model and materialisation engine. Originally based on two tabular datasets, the data was converted into RDF according to CHAD-AP, an OWL application profile built on standards like CIDOC-CRM, LRMoo, CRMdig, and Getty AAT. A reproducible pipeline, developed with a Morph-KGC extension, was used to generate the graph. CHAD-KG now serves as the main metadata source for the Digital Twin of the temporary exhibition titled \emph{The Other Renaissance - Ulisse Aldrovandi and The Wonders Of The World}, and other collections related to the digitisation work under development in a nationwide funded project, i.e. Project CHANGES (https://fondazionechanges.org). To ensure accessibility and reuse, it offers a SPARQL endpoint, a user interface, open documentation, and is published on Zenodo under a CC0 license. The project improves the semantic interoperability of cultural heritage data, with future work aiming to extend the data model and materialisation pipeline to better capture the complexities of acquisition and digitisation, further enrich the dataset and broaden its relevance to similar initiatives.</p></details> |  |

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex instructions, leading to poor performances on those not well represented among general samples. To address this, SLOT conducts few optimization steps at test-time to update a light-weight sample-specific parameter vector. It is added to the final hidden layer before the output head, and enables efficient adaptation by caching the last layer features during per-sample optimization. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss on the input prompt only, SLOT helps the model better aligned with and follow each given instruction. In experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms the compared models across multiple benchmarks and LLMs. For example, Qwen2.5-7B with SLOT achieves an accuracy gain of 8.6% on GSM8K from 57.54% to 66.19%, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B with SLOT achieves a SOTA accuracy of 68.69% on GPQA among 70B-level models.

While advancements in large language models (LLMs) and embodied intelligence make this goal closer, several challenges persist: the lack of a unified benchmark for more complex robot tasks, limited evaluation methods and metrics, data incompatibility between LLMs and mobile manipulation trajectories. To address these issues, we propose Embodied Mobile Manipulation in Open Environments (EMMOE), a benchmark that requires agents to interpret user instructions and execute long-horizon everyday tasks in continuous space. EMMOE seamlessly integrates high-level and low-level embodied tasks into a unified framework, along with three new metrics for more diverse assessment. Additionally, we collect~\dataset, which features in various task attributes, detailed process annotations, re-plans after failures, and two sub-datasets for LLM training. Furthermore, we design~\model, a sophisticated agent system consists of LLM with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), light weighted navigation and manipulation models, and multiple error detection mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate~\model's performance and evaluations of different models and policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Partitioning of GPU Power among Multi-Instances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17752v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient power management in cloud data centers is essential for reducing costs, enhancing performance, and minimizing environmental impact. GPUs, critical for tasks like machine learning (ML) and GenAI, are major contributors to power consumption. NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology improves GPU utilization by enabling isolated partitions with per-partition resource tracking, facilitating GPU sharing by multiple tenants. However, accurately apportioning GPU power consumption among MIG instances remains challenging due to a lack of hardware support. This paper addresses this challenge by developing software methods to estimate power usage per MIG partition. We analyze NVIDIA GPU utilization metrics and find that light-weight methods with good accuracy can be difficult to construct. We hence explore the use of ML-based power models to enable accurate, partition-level power estimation. Our findings reveal that a single generic offline power model or modeling method is not applicable across diverse workloads, especially with concurrent MIG usage, and that online models constructed using partition-level utilization metrics of workloads under execution can significantly improve accuracy. Using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we demonstrate this approach for accurate partition-level power estimation for workloads including matrix multiplication and Large Language Model inference, contributing to transparent and fair carbon reporting.</p></details> |  |

However, their heavy computation costs and model sizes are usually unacceptable in real-world deployment. Model quantization, an effective weight-lighting technique, has become an indispensable procedure in the whole deployment pipeline. The essence of quantization acceleration is the conversion from continuous floating-point numbers to discrete integer ones, which significantly speeds up the memory I/O and calculation, i.e., addition and multiplication. However, performance degradation also comes with the conversion because of the loss of precision. Therefore, it has become increasingly popular and critical to investigate how to perform the conversion and how to compensate for the information loss. This article surveys the recent five-year progress towards low-bit quantization on DNNs. We discuss and compare the state-of-the-art quantization methods and classify them into 8 main categories and 24 sub-categories according to their core techniques. Furthermore, we shed light on the potential research opportunities in the field of model quantization.

RINS is a particular form of recursive depth that significantly outperforms +55 other variants, including the recent "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM (Liu et al., 2024) and latent recurrent thinking (Geiping et al., 2025). Unlike prior works, we carry out our comparisons on a compute-matched regime, and demonstrate that for a fixed model size and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. More importantly, with light-weight (linear) adapters (comprising <1% of model parameters) and stochastic dropout, RINS offers a no-regret strategy, meaning that RINS-enabled pretraining improves performance in language modeling even when recursive depth is not applied at inference time. This corresponds to improving performance on a training compute-, parameter-, and inference-matched regime, suggesting its potential as a viable component of LLM pretraining!</p></details> |  |

Still, existing deep learning-based methods often require significant computational costs to generate diverse stylized results. Motivated by this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based framework for arbitrary style transfer RLMiniStyler. This framework leverages a unified reinforcement learning policy to iteratively guide the style transfer process by exploring and exploiting stylization feedback, generating smooth sequences of stylized results while achieving model lightweight. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty-aware multi-task learning strategy that automatically adjusts loss weights to adapt to the content and style balance requirements at different training stages, thereby accelerating model convergence. Through a series of experiments across image various resolutions, we have validated the advantages of RLMiniStyler over other state-of-the-art methods in generating high-quality, diverse artistic image sequences at a lower cost.

Using BLIP-2 as the core vision-language model, our system is evaluated on the PrideMM datasets. The results show that MemeBLIP2 can capture subtle cues in both modalities, even in cases with ironic or culturally specific content, thereby improving the detection of harmful material.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 3 figures, manucripts in preparation</p></details> |
| **[Light Weight CNN for classification of Brain Tumors from MRI Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21188v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for the multi-class classification of brain tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We utilize a publicly available dataset containing MRI images categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Our primary objective is to build a light weight deep learning model that can automatically classify brain tumor types with high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we incorporate image preprocessing steps, including normalization, data augmentation, and a cropping technique designed to reduce background noise and emphasize relevant regions. The CNN architecture is optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner, enabling systematic exploration of network parameters. To ensure reliable evaluation, we apply 5-fold cross-validation, where each hyperparameter configuration is evaluated across multiple data splits to mitigate overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.78%, indicating its potential as a diagnostic aid in clinical settings. The proposed method offers a low-complexity yet effective solution for assisting in early brain tumor diagnosis.</p></details> | 6 pages |

A lingo is a dialect's key security component by making attackers unable to "speak" the lingo. A lingo's "talk" changes all the time, becoming a moving target for attackers. We present several kinds of lingo transformations and compositions to generate stronger lingos from simpler ones, thus making dialects more secure.</p></details> |  |

However, no general solution has yet been found against the unpredictable behavior of neural networks and reinforcement learning agents. Nevertheless, the improvements of photo-realistic simulators have paved the way towards extensive testing of complex algorithms in different virtual scenarios, which would be expensive and dangerous to implement in the real world. This paper presents SimPRIVE, a simulation framework for physical robot interaction with virtual environments, which operates as a vehicle-in-the-loop platform, rendering a virtual world while operating the vehicle in the real world. Using SimPRIVE, any physical mobile robot running on ROS 2 can easily be configured to move its digital twin in a virtual world built with the Unreal Engine 5 graphic engine, which can be populated with objects, people, or other vehicles with programmable behavior. SimPRIVE has been designed to accommodate custom or pre-built virtual worlds while being light-weight to contain execution times and allow fast rendering. Its main advantage lies in the possibility of testing complex algorithms on the full software and hardware stack while minimizing the risks and costs of a test campaign. The framework has been validated by testing a reinforcement learning agent trained for obstacle avoidance on an AgileX Scout Mini rover that navigates a virtual office environment where everyday objects and people are placed as obstacles. The physical rover moves with no collision in an indoor limited space, thanks to a LiDAR-based heuristic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |

However, designing effective and efficient segmentation neural architectures is a labor-intensive process that may require numerous trials by human experts. In this paper, we address the challenge of integrating multi-head self-attention into high-resolution representation CNNs efficiently by leveraging architecture search. Manually replacing convolution layers with multi-head self-attention is non-trivial due to the costly overhead in memory to maintain high resolution. By contrast, we develop a multi-target multi-branch supernet method, which not only fully utilizes the advantages of high-resolution features but also finds the proper location for placing the multi-head self-attention module. Our search algorithm is optimized towards multiple objectives (e.g., latency and mIoU) and is capable of finding architectures on the Pareto frontier with an arbitrary number of branches in a single search. We further present a series of models via the Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search (HyCTAS) method that searches for the best hybrid combination of light-weight convolution layers and memory-efficient self-attention layers between branches from different resolutions and fuses them to high resolution for both efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyCTAS outperforms previous methods in both semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation tasks.

Given a horizontal partition of a table, a provenance sketch for a query Q records which fragments contain provenance. Once a provenance sketch has been captured for a query, it can be used to speed-up subsequent queries by skipping data that does not belong to a sketch. The size and, thus, also the effectiveness of a provenance sketch is often quite sensitive to the choice of attribute(s) we are partitioning on. In this work, we develop sample-based estimation techniques for the size of provenance sketches akin to a specialized form of approximate query processing. This technique enables the online selection of provenance sketches by estimating the size of sketches for a set of candidate attributes and then creating the sketch that is estimated to yield the largest benefit. We demonstrate experimentally that our estimation is accurate enough to select optimal or near optimal provenance sketches in most cases which in turn leads to a runtime improvement of up to %60 compared to other strategies for selecting provenance sketches.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lightweight Method for Generating Multi-Tier JIT Compilation Virtual Machine in a Meta-Tracing Compiler Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17460v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta-compiler frameworks, such as RPython and Graal/Truffle, generate high-performance virtual machines (VMs) from interpreter definitions. Although they generate VMs with high-quality just-in-time (JIT) compilers, they still lack an important feature that dedicated VMs (i.e., VMs that are developed for specific languages) have, namely \emph{multi-tier compilation}. Multi-tier compilation uses light-weight compilers at early stages and highly-optimizing compilers at later stages in order to balance between compilation overheads and code quality. We propose a novel approach to enabling multi-tier compilation in the VMs generated by a meta-compiler framework. Instead of extending the JIT compiler backend of the framework, our approach drives an existing (heavyweight) compiler backend in the framework to quickly generate unoptimized native code by merely embedding directives and compile-time operations into interpreter definitions. As a validation of the approach, we developed 2SOM, a Simple Object Machine with a two-tier JIT compiler based on RPython. 2SOM first applies the tier-1 threaded code generator that is generated by our proposed technique, then, to the loops that exceed a threshold, applies the tier-2 tracing JIT compiler that is generated by the original RPython framework. Our performance evaluation that runs a program with a realistic workload showed that 2SOM improved, when compared against an RPython-based VM, warm-up performance by 15\%, with merely a 5\% reduction in peak performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECOOP...</summary><p>ECOOP 2025.

| **[Light Edge Fault Tolerant Graph Spanners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10890v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has recently been significant interest in fault tolerant spanners, which are spanners that still maintain their stretch guarantees after some nodes or edges fail. This work has culminated in an almost complete understanding of the three-way tradeoff between stretch, sparsity, and number of faults tolerated. However, despite some progress in metric settings, there have been no results to date on the tradeoff in general graphs between stretch, lightness, and number of faults tolerated. We initiate the study of light edge fault tolerant (EFT) graph spanners, obtaining the first such results. First, we observe that lightness can be unbounded if we use the traditional definition (normalizing by the MST). We then argue that a natural definition of fault-tolerant lightness is to instead normalize by a min-weight fault tolerant connectivity preserver; essentially, a fault-tolerant version of the MST. However, even with this, we show that it is still not generally possible to construct $f$-EFT spanners whose weight compares reasonably to the weight of a min-weight $f$-EFT connectivity preserver. In light of this lower bound, it is natural to then consider bicriteria notions of lightness, where we compare the weight of an $f$-EFT spanner to a min-weight $(f' > f)$-EFT connectivity preserver. The most interesting question is to determine the minimum value of $f'$ that allows for reasonable lightness upper bounds. Our main result is a precise answer to this question: $f' = 2f$. In particular, we show that the lightness can be untenably large (roughly $n/k$ for a $k$-spanner) if one normalizes by the min-weight $(2f-1)$-EFT connectivity preserver. But if one normalizes by the min-weight $2f$-EFT connectivity preserver, then we show that the lightness is bounded by just $O(f^{1/2})$ times the non-fault tolerant lightness (roughly $n^{1/k}$, for a $(1+\epsilon)(2k-1)$-spanner).</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared at ICALP 2025.

Existing research typically tackles this problem through two main strategies: reducing model parameters and resampling inputs. However, light-weight Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformers often struggle to balance efficiency with high performance due to the requirement of long-range modeling capabilities. Recently, the state-space model, particularly Mamba, has emerged as a promising alternative, offering linear complexity with respect to sequence length. Meanwhile, efficient VQA heavily depends on resampling long sequences to minimize computational costs, yet current resampling methods are often weak in preserving essential semantic information. In this work, we present MVQA, a Mamba-based model designed for efficient VQA along with a novel Unified Semantic and Distortion Sampling (USDS) approach. USDS combines semantic patch sampling from low-resolution videos and distortion patch sampling from original-resolution videos. The former captures semantically dense regions, while the latter retains critical distortion details. To prevent computation increase from dual inputs, we propose a fusion mechanism using pre-defined masks, enabling a unified sampling strategy that captures both semantic and quality information without additional computational burden. Experiments show that the proposed MVQA, equipped with USDS, achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while being $2\times$ as fast and requiring only $1/5$ GPU memory.</p></details> |  |

However, controlling these large models for image restoration usually requires a large number of high-quality images and immense computational resources for training, which is costly and not privacy-friendly. In this paper, we find that the well-trained large T2I model (i.e., Flux) is able to produce a variety of high-quality images aligned with real-world distributions, offering an unlimited supply of training samples to mitigate the above issue. Specifically, we proposed a training data construction pipeline for image restoration, namely FluxGen, which includes unconditional image generation, image selection, and degraded image simulation. A novel light-weighted adapter (FluxIR) with squeeze-and-excitation layers is also carefully designed to control the large Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based T2I model so that reasonable details can be restored. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method enables the Flux model to adapt effectively to real-world image restoration tasks, achieving superior scores and visual quality on both synthetic and real-world degradation datasets - at only about 8.5\% of the training cost compared to current approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing approaches assume static data distributions, failing to adequately address real-world scenarios where new classes continually emerge, particularly in Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL). FCIL faces two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation caused by non-IID data across clients. Unlike current methods that maintain separate task-specific components or suffer from aggregation noise during parameter aggregation, we propose Federated Task-agnostic Low-rank Residual Adaptation (Fed-TaLoRA), a novel parameter-efficient approach for fine-tuning in resource-constrained FCIL scenarios. Specifically, we fine-tune only shared task-agnostic LoRA parameters across sequential tasks, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting while enabling efficient knowledge transfer among clients. Based on a theoretical analysis of aggregation, we develop a novel residual weight update mechanism that ensures accurate knowledge consolidation with minimal overhead. Our methodological innovations are attributed to three key strategies: task-agnostic adaptation, post-aggregation model calibration, and strategic placement of LoRA modules. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Fed-TaLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse data heterogeneity scenarios while substantially reducing resource requirements.</p></details> |  |

While existing EFCIL methods leverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two critical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the embeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks, and the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with new data, hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate a classifier reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits previous in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, on various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods.

Existing methods typically rely on correlation-based strategies, where an image's classification feature is used as a query to retrieve the most related key prompts and select the corresponding value prompts for training. However, these approaches face an inherent limitation: fitting the entire feature space of all tasks with only a few trainable prompts is fundamentally challenging. We propose Predictive Prompting (PrePrompt), a novel CIL framework that circumvents correlation-based limitations by leveraging pre-trained models' natural classification ability to predict task-specific prompts. Specifically, PrePrompt decomposes CIL into a two-stage prediction framework: task-specific prompt prediction followed by label prediction. While theoretically appealing, this framework risks bias toward recent classes due to missing historical data for older classifier calibration. PrePrompt then mitigates this by incorporating feature translation, dynamically balancing stability and plasticity. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate PrePrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art prompt-based CIL methods.

| **[AnalyticKWS: Towards Exemplar-Free Analytic Class Incremental Learning for Small-footprint Keyword Spotting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11817v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Keyword spotting (KWS) offers a vital mechanism to identify spoken commands in voice-enabled systems, where user demands often shift, requiring models to learn new keywords continually over time. However, a major problem is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose their ability to recognize earlier keywords. Although several continual learning methods have proven their usefulness for reducing forgetting, most existing approaches depend on storing and revisiting old data to combat catastrophic forgetting. Though effective, these methods face two practical challenges: 1) privacy risks from keeping user data and 2) large memory and time consumption that limit deployment on small devices. To address these issues, we propose an exemplar-free Analytic Continual Learning (AnalyticKWS) method that updates model parameters without revisiting earlier data. Inspired by efficient learning principles, AnalyticKWS computes a closed-form analytical solution for model updates and requires only a single epoch of adaptation for incoming keywords. AnalyticKWS demands fewer computational resources by avoiding gradient-based updates and does not store old data. By eliminating the need for back-propagation during incremental learning, the model remains lightweight and efficient. As a result, AnalyticKWS meets the challenges mentioned earlier and suits resource-limited settings well. Extensive experiments on various datasets and settings show that AnalyticKWS consistently outperforms existing continual learning methods.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

Current exemplar replay strategies impose $\mathcal{O}(t)$ memory/compute complexities. We propose an autoencoder-based hybrid replay (AHR) strategy that leverages our new hybrid autoencoder (HAE) to function as a compressor to alleviate the requirement for large memory, achieving $\mathcal{O}(0.1 t)$ at the worst case with the computing complexity of $\mathcal{O}(t)$ while accomplishing state-of-the-art performance. The decoder later recovers the exemplar data stored in the latent space, rather than in raw format. Additionally, HAE is designed for both discriminative and generative modeling, enabling classification and replay capabilities, respectively. HAE adopts the charged particle system energy minimization equations and repulsive force algorithm for the incremental embedding and distribution of new class centroids in its latent space. Our results demonstrate that AHR consistently outperforms recent baselines across multiple benchmarks while operating with the same memory/compute budgets. The source code is included in the supplementary material and will be open-sourced upon publication.</p></details> | Accepted ICML 2025 |
| **[A Plasticity-Aware Method for Continual Self-Supervised Learning in Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24088v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) methods have gained increasing attention in remote sensing (RS) due to their capability to learn new tasks sequentially from continuous streams of unlabeled data. Existing CSSL methods, while learning new tasks, focus on preventing catastrophic forgetting. To this end, most of them use regularization strategies to retain knowledge of previous tasks. This reduces the model's ability to adapt to the data of new tasks (i.e., learning plasticity), which can degrade performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel CSSL method that aims to learn tasks sequentially, while achieving high learning plasticity. To this end, the proposed method uses a knowledge distillation strategy with an integrated decoupling mechanism. The decoupling is achieved by first dividing the feature dimensions into task-common and task-specific parts. Then, the task-common features are forced to be correlated to ensure memory stability while the task-specific features are forced to be de-correlated facilitating the learning of new features. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to CaSSLe, which is a widely used CSSL framework, with improvements of up to 1.12% in average accuracy and 2.33% in intransigence in a task-incremental scenario, and 1.24% in average accuracy and 2.01% in intransigence in a class-incremental scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>We fo...</summary><p>We found the reported results of the compared method to be misleading</p></details> |
| **[Completely Weakly Supervised Class-Incremental Learning for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10781v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the task of completely weakly supervised class-incremental learning for semantic segmentation to learn segmentation for both base and additional novel classes using only image-level labels. While class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) is crucial for handling diverse and newly emerging objects in the real world, traditional CISS methods require expensive pixel-level annotations for training. To overcome this limitation, partially weakly-supervised approaches have recently been proposed. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a completely weakly-supervised method for CISS. To achieve this, we propose to generate robust pseudo-labels by combining pseudo-labels from a localizer and a sequence of foundation models based on their uncertainty. Moreover, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce an exemplar-guided data augmentation method that generates diverse images containing both previous and novel classes with guidance. Finally, we conduct experiments in three common experimental settings: 15-5 VOC, 10-10 VOC, and COCO-to-VOC, and in two scenarios: disjoint and overlap. The experimental results demonstrate that our completely weakly supervised method outperforms even partially weakly supervised methods in the 15-5 VOC and 10-10 VOC settings while achieving competitive accuracy in the COCO-to-VOC setting.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Preserving Plasticity in Continual Learning with Adaptive Linearity Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09486v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loss of plasticity in deep neural networks is the gradual reduction in a model's capacity to incrementally learn and has been identified as a key obstacle to learning in non-stationary problem settings. Recent work has shown that deep linear networks tend to be resilient towards loss of plasticity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Adaptive Linearization (AdaLin), a general approach that dynamically adapts each neuron's activation function to mitigate plasticity loss. Unlike prior methods that rely on regularization or periodic resets, AdaLin equips every neuron with a learnable parameter and a gating mechanism that injects linearity into the activation function based on its gradient flow. This adaptive modulation ensures sufficient gradient signal and sustains continual learning without introducing additional hyperparameters or requiring explicit task boundaries. When used with conventional activation functions like ReLU, Tanh, and GeLU, we demonstrate that AdaLin can significantly improve performance on standard benchmarks, including Random Label and Permuted MNIST, Random Label and Shuffled CIFAR-10, and Class-Split CIFAR-100. Furthermore, its efficacy is shown in more complex scenarios, such as class-incremental learning on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-18 backbone, and in mitigating plasticity loss in off-policy reinforcement learning agents. We perform a systematic set of ablations that show that neuron-level adaptation is crucial for good performance and analyze a number of metrics in the network that might be correlated to loss of plasticity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 4th Conference on Lifelong Learning Agents (CoLLAs), 2025</p></details> |
| **[GradMix: Gradient-based Selective Mixup for Robust Data Augmentation in Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08528v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of continual learning, acquiring new knowledge while maintaining previous knowledge presents a significant challenge. Existing methods often use experience replay techniques that store a small portion of previous task data for training. In experience replay approaches, data augmentation has emerged as a promising strategy to further improve the model performance by mixing limited previous task data with sufficient current task data. However, we theoretically and empirically analyze that training with mixed samples from random sample pairs may harm the knowledge of previous tasks and cause greater catastrophic forgetting. We then propose GradMix, a robust data augmentation method specifically designed for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning. GradMix performs gradient-based selective mixup using a class-based criterion that mixes only samples from helpful class pairs and not from detrimental class pairs for reducing catastrophic forgetting. Our experiments on various real datasets show that GradMix outperforms data augmentation baselines in accuracy by minimizing the forgetting of previous knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-Complexity Inference in Continual Learning via Compressed Knowledge Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08327v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) aims to train models that can learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. A core challenge in CL is balancing stability -- preserving performance on old tasks -- and plasticity -- adapting to new ones. Recently, large pre-trained models have been widely adopted in CL for their ability to support both, offering strong generalization for new tasks and resilience against forgetting. However, their high computational cost at inference time limits their practicality in real-world applications, especially those requiring low latency or energy efficiency. To address this issue, we explore model compression techniques, including pruning and knowledge distillation (KD), and propose two efficient frameworks tailored for class-incremental learning (CIL), a challenging CL setting where task identities are unavailable during inference. The pruning-based framework includes pre- and post-pruning strategies that apply compression at different training stages. The KD-based framework adopts a teacher-student architecture, where a large pre-trained teacher transfers downstream-relevant knowledge to a compact student. Extensive experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed frameworks achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and inference complexity, consistently outperforming strong baselines. We further analyze the trade-offs between the two frameworks in terms of accuracy and efficiency, offering insights into their use across different scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lifelong Whole Slide Image Analysis: Online Vision-Language Adaptation and Past-to-Present Gradient Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01984v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) play a crucial role in accurate cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as they provide tissue details at the cellular level. However, the rapid growth of computational tasks involving WSIs poses significant challenges. Given that WSIs are gigapixels in size, they present difficulties in terms of storage, processing, and model training. Therefore, it is essential to develop lifelong learning approaches for WSI analysis. In scenarios where slides are distributed across multiple institutes, we aim to leverage them to develop a unified online model as a computational tool for cancer diagnosis in clinical and hospital settings. In this study, we introduce ADaFGrad, a method designed to enhance lifelong learning for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis. First, we leverage pathology vision-language foundation models to develop a framework that enables interaction between a slide's regional tissue features and a predefined text-based prototype buffer. Additionally, we propose a gradient-distillation mechanism that mimics the gradient of a logit with respect to the classification-head parameters across past and current iterations in a continual-learning setting. We construct a sequence of six TCGA datasets for training and evaluation. Experimental results show that ADaFGrad outperforms both state-of-the-art WSI-specific and conventional continual-learning methods after only a few training epochs, exceeding them by up to +5.068% in the class-incremental learning scenario while exhibiting the least forgetting (i.e., retaining the most knowledge from previous tasks). Moreover, ADaFGrad surpasses its baseline by as much as +40.084% in accuracy, further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Additive Parameter Updates of Vision Transformers for Few-Shot Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08982v2)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating new class information without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence, often referred to as catastrophic forgetting. Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) addresses this by first training a model on a robust dataset of base classes and then incrementally adapting it in successive sessions using only a few labeled examples per novel class. However, this approach is prone to overfitting on the limited new data, which can compromise overall performance and exacerbate forgetting. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective novel FSCIL framework that leverages a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone augmented with parameter-efficient additive updates. Our approach freezes the pre-trained ViT parameters and selectively injects trainable weights into the self-attention modules via an additive update mechanism. This design updates only a small subset of parameters to accommodate new classes without sacrificing the representations learned during the base session. By fine-tuning a limited number of parameters, our method preserves the generalizable features in the frozen ViT while reducing the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, as most parameters remain fixed, the model avoids overwriting previously learned knowledge when small novel data batches are introduced. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach yields state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline FSCIL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[SacFL: Self-Adaptive Federated Continual Learning for Resource-Constrained End Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00365v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm, wherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data generated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by continuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device models. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling machine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is unsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this context, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution, preserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative updates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor autonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial tasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and task-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining lightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices. Moreover, $\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an autonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new task has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately allows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without additional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and THUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\rm{SacFL}$ in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios. Furthermore, a demo system has been developed to verify its practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TNNLS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Partitioned Memory Storage Inspired Few-Shot Class-Incremental learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20797v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current mainstream deep learning techniques exhibit an over-reliance on extensive training data and a lack of adaptability to the dynamic world, marking a considerable disparity from human intelligence. To bridge this gap, Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) has emerged, focusing on continuous learning of new categories with limited samples without forgetting old knowledge. Existing FSCIL studies typically use a single model to learn knowledge across all sessions, inevitably leading to the stability-plasticity dilemma. Unlike machines, humans store varied knowledge in different cerebral cortices. Inspired by this characteristic, our paper aims to develop a method that learns independent models for each session. It can inherently prevent catastrophic forgetting. During the testing stage, our method integrates Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for model deployment. Our method provides a fresh viewpoint for FSCIL and demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100 and mini-ImageNet datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inclusive Training Separation and Implicit Knowledge Interaction for Balanced Online Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20566v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online class-incremental learning (OCIL) focuses on gradually learning new classes (called plasticity) from a stream of data in a single-pass, while concurrently preserving knowledge of previously learned classes (called stability). The primary challenge in OCIL lies in maintaining a good balance between the knowledge of old and new classes within the continually updated model. Most existing methods rely on explicit knowledge interaction through experience replay, and often employ exclusive training separation to address bias problems. Nevertheless, it still remains a big challenge to achieve a well-balanced learner, as these methods often exhibit either reduced plasticity or limited stability due to difficulties in continually integrating knowledge in the OCIL setting. In this paper, we propose a novel replay-based method, called Balanced Online Incremental Learning (BOIL), which can achieve both high plasticity and stability, thus ensuring more balanced performance in OCIL. Our BOIL method proposes an inclusive training separation strategy using dual classifiers so that knowledge from both old and new classes can effectively be integrated into the model, while introducing implicit approaches for transferring knowledge across the two classifiers. Extensive experimental evaluations over three widely-used OCIL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of BOIL, showing more balanced yet better performance compared to state-of-the-art replay-based OCIL methods.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Dynamic Integration of Task-Specific Adapters for Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14983v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-exemplar class Incremental Learning (NECIL) enables models to continuously acquire new classes without retraining from scratch and storing old task exemplars, addressing privacy and storage issues. However, the absence of data from earlier tasks exacerbates the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in NECIL. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Integration of task-specific Adapters (DIA), which comprises two key components: Task-Specific Adapter Integration (TSAI) and Patch-Level Model Alignment. TSAI boosts compositionality through a patch-level adapter integration strategy, which provides a more flexible compositional solution while maintaining low computation costs. Patch-Level Model Alignment maintains feature consistency and accurate decision boundaries via two specialized mechanisms: Patch-Level Distillation Loss (PDL) and Patch-Level Feature Reconstruction method (PFR). Specifically, the PDL preserves feature-level consistency between successive models by implementing a distillation loss based on the contributions of patch tokens to new class learning. The PFR facilitates accurate classifier alignment by reconstructing old class features from previous tasks that adapt to new task knowledge. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our DIA, revealing significant improvements on benchmark datasets in the NECIL setting, maintaining an optimal balance between computational complexity and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperparameters in Continual Learning: A Reality Check](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09066v4)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) aims to train a model on a sequence of tasks (i.e., a CL scenario) while balancing the trade-off between plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (retaining prior knowledge). The dominantly adopted conventional evaluation protocol for CL algorithms selects the best hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, mini-batch size, regularization strengths, etc.) within a given scenario and then evaluates the algorithms using these hyperparameters in the same scenario. However, this protocol has significant shortcomings: it overestimates the CL capacity of algorithms and relies on unrealistic hyperparameter tuning, which is not feasible for real-world applications. From the fundamental principles of evaluation in machine learning, we argue that the evaluation of CL algorithms should focus on assessing the generalizability of their CL capacity to unseen scenarios. Based on this, we propose the Generalizable Two-phase Evaluation Protocol (GTEP) consisting of hyperparameter tuning and evaluation phases. Both phases share the same scenario configuration (e.g., number of tasks) but are generated from different datasets. Hyperparameters of CL algorithms are tuned in the first phase and applied in the second phase to evaluate the algorithms. We apply this protocol to class-incremental learning, both with and without pretrained models. Across more than 8,000 experiments, our results show that most state-of-the-art algorithms fail to replicate their reported performance, highlighting that their CL capacity has been significantly overestimated in the conventional evaluation protocol. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/csm9493/GTEP.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |
| **[Enhancing Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning through Neural Collapse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18437v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) is a critical capability for real-world applications, enabling learning systems to adapt to new tasks while retaining knowledge from previous ones. Recent advancements in pre-trained models (PTMs) have significantly advanced the field of CIL, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods. However, understanding how features evolve and are distributed across incremental tasks remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to modeling feature evolution in PTM-based CIL through the lens of neural collapse (NC), a striking phenomenon observed in the final phase of training, which leads to a well-separated, equiangular feature space. We explore the connection between NC and CIL effectiveness, showing that aligning feature distributions with the NC geometry enhances the ability to capture the dynamic behavior of continual learning. Based on this insight, we introduce Neural Collapse-inspired Pre-Trained Model-based CIL (NCPTM-CIL), a method that dynamically adjusts the feature space to conform to the elegant NC structure, thereby enhancing the continual learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCPTM-CIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets. Notably, when initialized with ViT-B/16-IN1K, NCPTM-CIL surpasses the runner-up method by 6.73% on VTAB, 1.25% on CIFAR-100, and 2.5% on OmniBenchmark.</p></details> |  |

Adaptation requires algorithms capable of continual learning (CL). Continual learners must be plastic to adapt to novel tasks while minimizing forgetting of previous tasks.However, CL opens up avenues for noise to enter the training pipeline and disrupt the CL. This work focuses on label noise and instance noise in the context of class-incremental learning (CIL), where new classes are added to a classifier over time, and there is no access to external data from past classes. We aim to understand the sensitivity of CL methods that work by replaying items from a memory constructed using the idea of Coresets. We derive a new bound for the robustness of such a method to uncorrelated instance noise under a general additive noise threat model, revealing several insights. Putting the theory into practice, we create two continual learning algorithms to construct noise-tolerant replay buffers. We empirically compare the effectiveness of prior memory-based continual learners and the proposed algorithms under label and uncorrelated instance noise on five diverse datasets. We show that existing memory-based CL are not robust whereas the proposed methods exhibit significant improvements in maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing forgetting in the noisy CIL setting.</p></details> | Work-in-Progress |

Recent multi-modal approaches have shown promise in improving FFIA robustness and efficiency. However, these methods face significant challenges when adapting to new fish species or environments due to catastrophic forgetting and the lack of suitable datasets. To address these limitations, we first introduce AV-CIL-FFIA, a new dataset comprising 81,932 labelled audio-visual clips capturing feeding intensities across six different fish species in real aquaculture environments. Then, we pioneer audio-visual class incremental learning (CIL) for FFIA and demonstrate through benchmarking on AV-CIL-FFIA that it significantly outperforms single-modality methods. Existing CIL methods rely heavily on historical data. Exemplar-based approaches store raw samples, creating storage challenges, while exemplar-free methods avoid data storage but struggle to distinguish subtle feeding intensity variations across different fish species. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HAIL-FFIA, a novel audio-visual class-incremental learning framework that bridges this gap with a prototype-based approach that achieves exemplar-free efficiency while preserving essential knowledge through compact feature representations. Specifically, HAIL-FFIA employs hierarchical representation learning with a dual-path knowledge preservation mechanism that separates general intensity knowledge from fish-specific characteristics. Additionally, it features a dynamic modality balancing system that adaptively adjusts the importance of audio versus visual information based on feeding behaviour stages. Experimental results show that HAIL-FFIA is superior to SOTA methods on AV-CIL-FFIA, achieving higher accuracy with lower storage needs while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting in incremental fish species learning.</p></details> |  |
