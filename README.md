| **[Biology-informed neural networks learn nonlinear representations from omics data to improve genomic prediction and interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14970v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together, BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection, pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.</p></details> | 35 pages, 12 figures |

| **[Matcha: Multi-Stage Riemannian Flow Matching for Accurate and Physically Valid Molecular Docking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14586v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed, accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces ($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are available at https://github.com/LigandPro/Matcha.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coder as Editor: Code-driven Interpretable Molecular Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14455v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution, MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design, laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative human-AI workflows in drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Analysis of Molecular Kernels: When Richer Features Do Not Guarantee Better Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14217v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations, spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, SI: 8 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

| **[Superior Molecular Representations from Intermediate Encoder Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06443v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation. However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we first analyze the information flow in five diverse molecular encoders and find that intermediate layers retain more general-purpose features, whereas the final-layer specializes and compresses information. We then perform an empirical layer-wise evaluation across 22 property prediction tasks. We find that using frozen embeddings from optimal intermediate layers improves downstream performance by an average of 5.4%, up to 28.6%, compared to the final-layer. Furthermore, finetuning encoders truncated at intermediate depths achieves even greater average improvements of 8.5%, with increases as high as 40.8%, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unified and Lossless Latent Space for 3D Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15567v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality. On GEOM-Drugs, it reduces FCD by 72.6\% over the previous best result, while achieving over 70\% relative average improvements in geometric fidelity. Our code is released at https://github.com/lyc0930/UAE-3D/.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Controllable Graph Generation with Diffusion Models via Inference-Time Tree Search Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10402v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation. TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition, reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods plateau early under limited resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Bayesian Flow Networks for Molecular Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10211v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently, prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmenting generative models with biomedical knowledge graphs improves targeted drug discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09914v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model), a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical therapeutic development.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence, October 2025</p></details> |
| **[MolSpectLLM: A Molecular Foundation Model Bridging Spectroscopy, Molecule Elucidation, and 3D Structure Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21861v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction. Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks. MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task, obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular elucidation, and molecular design. Code are available at \href{https://github.com/Eurekashen/MolSpectLLM}{https://github.com/Eurekashen/MolSpectLLM}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Agent for Modular Task Execution in Drug Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02925v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved relevant biomolecular information, including FASTA sequences, SMILES representations, and literature, and answered mechanistic questions with improved contextual accuracy compared to standard LLMs. It then generated chemically diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55. The number of molecules satisfying empirical drug-likeness filters also rose; for example, compliance with the Ghose filter increased from 32 to 55 within a pool of 100 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models, providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Inertial Langevin Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06723v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel method for drawing samples from Gibbs distributions with densities of the form $\pi(x) \propto \exp(-U(x))$. The method accelerates the unadjusted Langevin algorithm by introducing an inertia term similar to Polyak's heavy ball method, together with a corresponding noise rescaling. Interpreting the scheme as a discretization of \emph{kinetic} Langevin dynamics, we prove ergodicity (in continuous and discrete time) for twice continuously differentiable, strongly convex, and $L$-smooth potentials and bound the bias of the discretization to the target in Wasserstein-2 distance. In particular, the presented proofs allow for smaller friction parameters in the kinetic Langevin diffusion compared to existing literature. Moreover, we show the close ties of the proposed method to the over-relaxed Gibbs sampler. The scheme is tested in an extensive set of numerical experiments covering simple toy examples, total variation image denoising, and the complex task of maximum likelihood learning of an energy-based model for molecular structure generation. The experimental results confirm the acceleration provided by the proposed scheme even beyond the strongly convex and $L$-smooth setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOG-Diff: Higher-Order Guided Diffusion for Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04308v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph generation is a critical yet challenging task as empirical analyses require a deep understanding of complex, non-Euclidean structures. Diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, but these models are typically adapted from image generation frameworks and overlook inherent higher-order topology, leaving them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff), a principled framework that progressively generates plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. HOG-Diff follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum guided by higher-order topology and implemented via diffusion bridges. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiminghh/HOG-Diff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow-Matching Based Refiner for Molecular Conformer Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04878v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-energy molecular conformers generation (MCG) is a foundational yet challenging problem in drug discovery. Denoising-based methods include diffusion and flow-matching methods that learn mappings from a simple base distribution to the molecular conformer distribution. However, these approaches often suffer from error accumulation during sampling, especially in the low SNR steps, which are hard to train. To address these challenges, we propose a flow-matching refiner for the MCG task. The proposed method initializes sampling from mixed-quality outputs produced by upstream denoising models and reschedules the noise scale to bypass the low-SNR phase, thereby improving sample quality. On the GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs benchmark datasets, the generator-refiner pipeline improves quality with fewer total denoising steps while preserving diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frame-based Equivariant Diffusion Models for 3D Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19506v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity, we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention. On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale, alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of global structure preservation.</p></details> |  |

| **[GraphLand: Evaluating Graph Machine Learning Models on Diverse Industrial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14500v4)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although data that can be naturally represented as graphs is widespread in real-world applications across diverse industries, popular graph ML benchmarks for node property prediction only cover a surprisingly narrow set of data domains, and graph neural networks (GNNs) are often evaluated on just a few academic citation networks. This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines. Further, we evaluate currently available general-purpose graph foundation models and find that they fail to produce competitive results on our proposed datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Computing Communications for Multi-User Virtual Reality in Distributed Mobile Edge Computing Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14243v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Immersive virtual reality (VR) applications impose stringent requirements on latency, energy efficiency, and computational resources, particularly in multi-user interactive scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet the latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by users and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive environments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource requirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously minimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC resources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective consistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights. Leveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station datasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and significantly lower inference latency than baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis reveals practical deployment patterns: latency-oriented solutions favor local MEC execution to reduce transmission delay, while energy-oriented solutions minimize redundant placements to save energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submited to IEEE journal</p></details> |

Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights. Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN, a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong performance holds even with limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in Frontiers in Bioinformatics</p></details> |

Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025), Main Track</p></details> |
| **[On the expressivity of sparse maxout networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14068v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, where each neuron takes a fixed number of inputs from the previous layer and employs a, possibly multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.</p></details> |  |
| **[Maximum entropy temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02098v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks consist of timestamped directed interactions that may appear continuously in time, yet few studies have directly tackled the continuous-time modeling of networks. Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes and a static maximum-entropy edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree, clustering and motif expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of an inhomogeneous Poisson edge intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting NHPP modeling to maximum-entropy network ensembles. NHPP consistently improve log-likelihood over generic Poisson processes, while the maximum-entropy edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this framework and how it can be integrated with multivariate Hawkes calibration procedures, renewal theory, and neural kernel estimation in graph neural networks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 25 figures |

Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems, while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced search requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages content. 2 pages references</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale High-Resolution Logarithmic Grapher Module for Efficient Vision GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13740v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN) and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy, GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3% reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art ViGs.

| **[Axial Neural Networks for Dimension-Free Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13665v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems. Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining for foundation models.</p></details> |  |

We adopt a task-oriented perspective to systematically review the applications and advancements of multimodal fusion methods and VLMs in the field of robot vision. For semantic scene understanding tasks, we categorize fusion approaches into encoder-decoder frameworks, attention-based architectures, and graph neural networks. Meanwhile, we also analyze the architectural characteristics and practical implementations of these fusion strategies in key tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 3D object detection, navigation, and manipulation. We compare the evolutionary paths and applicability of VLMs based on large language models (LLMs) with traditional multimodal fusion methods.Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of commonly used datasets, evaluating their applicability and challenges in real-world robotic scenarios. Building on this analysis, we identify key challenges in current research, including cross-modal alignment, efficient fusion, real-time deployment, and domain adaptation. We propose future directions such as self-supervised learning for robust multimodal representations, structured spatial memory and environment modeling to enhance spatial intelligence, and the integration of adversarial robustness and human feedback mechanisms to enable ethically aligned system deployment. Through a comprehensive review, comparative analysis, and forward-looking discussion, we provide a valuable reference for advancing multimodal perception and interaction in robotic vision.

To optimize this process, existing works often employs message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to predict quality of results (QoR). These predictors serve as evaluators in the DSE process, effectively bypassing the time-consuming estimations traditionally required by HLS tools. However, existing models based on MPNNs struggle with over-smoothing and limited expressiveness. Additionally, while meta-heuristic algorithms are widely used in DSE, they typically require extensive domain-specific knowledge to design operators and time-consuming tuning. To address these limitations, we propose ECoGNNs-LLMMHs, a framework that integrates graph neural networks with task-adaptive message passing and large language model-enhanced meta-heuristic algorithms. Compared with state-of-the-art works, ECoGNN exhibits lower prediction error in the post-HLS prediction task, with the error reduced by 57.27\%. For post-implementation prediction tasks, ECoGNN demonstrates the lowest prediction errors, with average reductions of 17.6\% for flip-flop (FF) usage, 33.7\% for critical path (CP) delay, 26.3\% for power consumption, 38.3\% for digital signal processor (DSP) utilization, and 40.8\% for BRAM usage. LLMMH variants can generate superior Pareto fronts compared to meta-heuristic algorithms in terms of average distance from the reference set (ADRS) with average improvements of 87.47\%, respectively. Compared with the SOTA DSE approaches GNN-DSE and IRONMAN-PRO, LLMMH can reduce the ADRS by 68.17\% and 63.07\% respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Going with the Flow: Approximating Banzhaf Values via Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13391v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count (5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 11-page appendix</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Teleconnections with Physics-Informed Graph Attention Networks for Long-Range Extreme Rainfall Forecasting in Thailand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12328v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Graph Domain Adaptation: A Spectral Contrastive Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13254v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover, the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Are High-Degree Representations Really Unnecessary in Equivariant Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11443v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that incorporate E(3) symmetry have achieved significant success in various scientific applications. As one of the most successful models, EGNN leverages a simple scalarization technique to perform equivariant message passing over only Cartesian vectors (i.e., 1st-degree steerable vectors), enjoying greater efficiency and efficacy compared to equivariant GNNs using higher-degree steerable vectors. This success suggests that higher-degree representations might be unnecessary. In this paper, we disprove this hypothesis by exploring the expressivity of equivariant GNNs on symmetric structures, including $k$-fold rotations and regular polyhedra. We theoretically demonstrate that equivariant GNNs will always degenerate to a zero function if the degree of the output representations is fixed to 1 or other specific values. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose HEGNN, a high-degree version of EGNN to increase the expressivity by incorporating high-degree steerable vectors while maintaining EGNN's efficiency through the scalarization trick. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HEGNN not only aligns with our theoretical analyses on toy datasets consisting of symmetric structures, but also shows substantial improvements on more complicated datasets such as $N$-body and MD17. Our theoretical findings and empirical results potentially open up new possibilities for the research of equivariant GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universally Invariant Learning in Equivariant GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13169v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and 2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining strong practical efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-hoc Popularity Bias Correction in GNN-based Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12959v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User historical interaction data is the primary signal for learning user preferences in collaborative filtering (CF). However, the training data often exhibits a long-tailed distribution, where only a few items have the majority of interactions. CF models trained directly on such imbalanced data are prone to learning popularity bias, which reduces personalization and leads to suboptimal recommendation quality. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), while effective for CF due to their message passing mechanism, can further propagate and amplify popularity bias through their aggregation process. Existing approaches typically address popularity bias by modifying training objectives but fail to directly counteract the bias propagated during GNN's neighborhood aggregation. Applying weights to interactions during aggregation can help alleviate this problem, yet it risks distorting model learning due to unstable node representations in the early stages of training. In this paper, we propose a Post-hoc Popularity Debiasing (PPD) method that corrects for popularity bias in GNN-based CF and operates directly on pre-trained embeddings without requiring retraining. By estimating interaction-level popularity and removing popularity components from node representations via a popularity direction vector, PPD reduces bias while preserving user preferences. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for popularity bias correction in GNN-based CF.</p></details> |  |

While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity -- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power often comes at the cost of generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Neurodegeneration with Brain Age Gap Prediction Models: A Graph Signal Processing Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12763v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neurodegeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal structure or function, is commonly assessed in clinical practice through reductions in cortical thickness or brain volume, as visualized by structural MRI. While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical sophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy aging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age gap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain age gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's predicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The resulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with recent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and severity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their methodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical populations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces a principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in graph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the anatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong theoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust estimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP, machine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path forward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research directions in personalized medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Signal Processing Magazine</p></details> |

These models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for multi-view consistent editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://coupled-diffusion.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Learning an Image Editing Model without Image Editing Pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14978v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data, our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://nupurkmr9.github.io/npedit/</p></details> |

Given such poses, humans can intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics, drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors, Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we (1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2) introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages; Project Page: https://doby-xu.github.io/WithAnyone/; Code: https://github.com/Doby-Xu/WithAnyone</p></details> |

This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep. The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while maintaining teacher-level quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Lakonik/piFlow Demos: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Lakonik/pi-Qwen and https://huggingface.co/spaces/Lakonik/pi-FLUX.1</p></details> |
| **[Attention Is All You Need for KV Cache in Diffusion LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14973v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose ${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences, and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput ($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://vila-lab.github.io/elastic-cache-webpage/</p></details> |
| **[RainDiff: End-to-end Precipitation Nowcasting Via Token-wise Attention Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14962v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder, adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion, thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex precipitation forecasting scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Parallel Samplers for Recurrent-Depth Models and Their Connection to Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14961v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence. Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently, our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal, diffusion language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code can be found at https://github.com/seal-rg/recurrent-pretraining</p></details> |

Unlike previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer, where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization, we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance. The code of our method will be made public.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Language to Locomotion: Retargeting-free Humanoid Control via Motion Latent Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14952v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and unreliable. They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages. Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking accuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities such as images, audio, and music, providing a general foundation for vision-language-action humanoid systems.</p></details> |  |

However, can multimodal generative models effectively produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200 unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present VT-Refine, a visuo-tactile policy learning framework that combines real-world demonstrations, high-fidelity tactile simulation, and reinforcement learning to tackle precise, contact-rich bimanual assembly. We begin by training a diffusion policy on a small set of demonstrations using synchronized visual and tactile inputs. This policy is then transferred to a simulated digital twin equipped with simulated tactile sensors and further refined via large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance robustness and generalization. To enable accurate sim-to-real transfer, we leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide normal force signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using GPU-accelerated simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves assembly performance in both simulation and the real world by increasing data diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning.

The governing partial differential equations that we solve are the electroneutral Navier-Stokes-Onsager-Stefan-Maxwell (NSOSM) equations, which model momentum transport, multicomponent diffusion and electrical effects within the electrolyte. Our algorithms can be applied in the steady and transient settings, in two and three spatial dimensions, and under a variety of boundary conditions. Moreover, we allow for the material parameters (e.g. viscosity, diffusivities, thermodynamic factors and density) to be solution-dependent and thermodynamically non-ideal. The flexibility of our approach requires us to address subtleties that arise in the governing equations due to the interplay between boundary conditions and the equation of state. We demonstrate the algorithms in various physical configurations, including (i) electrolyte flow around a microfluidic rotating disk electrode and (ii) the flow in a Hull cell of a cosolvent electrolyte mixture used in lithium-ion batteries.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce Action-Guided Diffusion Policy (DP-AG), a unified representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP-AG encodes latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning between perception and action, we introduce a cycle-consistent contrastive loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent perception-action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP-AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across simulation benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP-AG offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial policy learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information. Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |

Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language. Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing, poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse, and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

Following Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models have become the mainstream, owing to their robust generative capacities. However, inherent limitations of the diffusion process often lead to inter-frame flicker and slow inference, restricting their practical deployment. To address this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head animations from a single reference image, driven directly by text or audio input. To mitigate flicker and ensure continuity, AvatarSync leverages an autoregressive pipeline that enhances temporal modeling. In addition, to ensure controllability, we introduce phonemes, which are the basic units of speech sounds, and construct a many-to-one mapping from text/audio to phonemes, enabling precise phoneme-to-visual alignment. Additionally, to further accelerate inference, we adopt a two-stage generation strategy that decouples semantic modeling from visual dynamics, and incorporate a customized Phoneme-Frame Causal Attention Mask to support multi-step parallel acceleration. Extensive experiments conducted on both Chinese (CMLR) and English (HDTF) datasets demonstrate that AvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a scalable and controllable solution.</p></details> |  |

We present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on diffusion visuomotor policies trained bu supervised learning. RL-100 introduces a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors. Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement. Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control, such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100 attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900 episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to two hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://lei-kun.github.io/RL-100/</p></details> |

Existing models often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of 73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted at ICCV Conference 2025</p></details> |

However, existing open-vocabulary and visual grounding methods rely on explicit category cues, limiting their ability to handle complex or implicit queries that require advanced reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce a new suite of tasks, including Instruction-Oriented Object Counting, Detection, and Segmentation (InstructCDS), covering open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass scenarios. We further present EarthInstruct, the first InstructCDS benchmark for earth observation. It is constructed from two diverse remote sensing datasets with varying spatial resolutions and annotation rules across 20 categories, necessitating models to interpret dataset-specific instructions. Given the scarcity of semantically rich labeled data in remote sensing, we propose InstructSAM, a training-free framework for instruction-driven object recognition. InstructSAM leverages large vision-language models to interpret user instructions and estimate object counts, employs SAM2 for mask proposal, and formulates mask-label assignment as a binary integer programming problem. By integrating semantic similarity with counting constraints, InstructSAM efficiently assigns categories to predicted masks without relying on confidence thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that InstructSAM matches or surpasses specialized baselines across multiple tasks while maintaining near-constant inference time regardless of object count, reducing output tokens by 89% and overall runtime by over 32% compared to direct generation approaches. We believe the contributions of the proposed tasks, benchmark, and effective approach will advance future research in developing versatile object recognition systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While many text-to-image models prioritize aesthetics over accessibility, it is not clear how visual illustrations relate to text simplifications (TS) generated from them. This paper presents a structured vision-language model (VLM) prompting framework for generating accessible images from simplified texts. We designed five prompt templates, i.e., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, Educational Layout, Multi-Level Detail, and Grid Layout, each following distinct spatial arrangements while adhering to accessibility constraints such as object count limits, spatial separation, and content restrictions. Using 400 sentence-level simplifications from four established TS datasets (OneStopEnglish, SimPA, Wikipedia, and ASSET), we conducted a two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assessed prompt template effectiveness with CLIPScores, and Phase 2 involved human annotation of generated images across ten visual styles by four accessibility experts. Results show that the Basic Object Focus prompt template achieved the highest semantic alignment, indicating that visual minimalism enhances language accessibility. Expert evaluation further identified Retro style as the most accessible and Wikipedia as the most effective data source. Inter-annotator agreement varied across dimensions, with Text Simplicity showing strong reliability and Image Quality proving more subjective. Overall, our framework offers practical guidelines for accessible content generation and underscores the importance of structured prompting in AI-generated visual accessibility tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Numerosity in Diffusion Models -- Limitations and Remedies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11117v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6 featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization across settings.</p></details> |  |

While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation, axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image generative models.</p></details> |  |

A persistent challenge, however, is disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational circuits.</p></details> |  |

This widespread deep-layer bias, however, is largely driven by empirical convention rather than principled analysis. While prior studies suggest that different ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, the impact of this variation on MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present the first comprehensive study of visual layer selection for MLLMs, analyzing representation similarity across ViT layers to establish shallow, middle, and deep layer groupings. Through extensive evaluation of MLLMs (1.4B-7B parameters) across 10 benchmarks encompassing 60+ tasks, we find that while deep layers excel in semantic-rich tasks like OCR, shallow and middle layers significantly outperform them on fine-grained visual tasks including counting, positioning, and object localization. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight feature fusion method that strategically incorporates shallower layers, achieving consistent improvements over both single-layer and specialized fusion baselines. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, showing that MLLMs can often see better when they look shallower.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, accepted by EMNLP2025</p></details> |
| **[Visual Representation Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07979v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning. We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/VIRAL/</p></details> |

However, multi-object scenes remain challenging, as reliable control over object categories, counts, and spatial layout is difficult to achieve. For that, we first study quantity and layout consistent image editing, abbreviated as QL-Edit, which targets control of object quantity and spatial layout in multi-object scenes. Then, we present IMAGHarmony, a straightforward framework featuring a plug-and-play harmony aware (HA) module that fuses perception semantics while modeling object counts and locations, resulting in accurate edits and strong structural consistency. We further observe that diffusion models are sensitive to the choice of initial noise and tend to prefer certain noise patterns. Based on this finding, we present a preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that selects semantically aligned initial noise through vision and language matching, thereby further improving generation stability and layout consistency in multiple object editing. To support evaluation, we develop HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers a diverse range of quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGHarmony outperforms prior methods in both structural alignment and semantic accuracy, utilizing only 200 training images and 10.6M of trainable parameters.

| **[MetaSlot: Break Through the Fixed Number of Slots in Object-Centric Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20772v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning object-level, structured representations is widely regarded as a key to better generalization in vision and underpins the design of next-generation Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs). Mainstream Object-Centric Learning (OCL) methods adopt Slot Attention or its variants to iteratively aggregate objects' super-pixels into a fixed set of query feature vectors, termed slots. However, their reliance on a static slot count leads to an object being represented as multiple parts when the number of objects varies. We introduce MetaSlot, a plug-and-play Slot Attention variant that adapts to variable object counts. MetaSlot (i) maintains a codebook that holds prototypes of objects in a dataset by vector-quantizing the resulting slot representations; (ii) removes duplicate slots from the traditionally aggregated slots by quantizing them with the codebook; and (iii) injects progressively weaker noise into the Slot Attention iterations to accelerate and stabilize the aggregation. MetaSlot is a general Slot Attention variant that can be seamlessly integrated into existing OCL architectures. Across multiple public datasets and tasks--including object discovery and recognition--models equipped with MetaSlot achieve significant performance gains and markedly interpretable slot representations, compared with existing Slot Attention variants.</p></details> |  |

Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear, consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts; reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack: incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design, rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate computation with respect to complexity.</p></details> |  |

These models have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark, VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation. Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the \textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach for reducing it.</p></details> |  |

We propose a multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11 underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains, demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset, highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable ecological insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+1 p...</summary><p>8+1 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Previously, this task was dominated by class-specific methods, which have gradually evolved into more adaptable class-agnostic strategies. However, these strategies come with their own set of limitations, such as the need for manual exemplar input and multiple passes for multiple categories, resulting in significant inefficiencies. This paper introduces a more practical approach enabling simultaneous counting of multiple object categories using an open-vocabulary framework. Our solution, OmniCount, stands out by using semantic and geometric insights (priors) from pre-trained models to count multiple categories of objects as specified by users, all without additional training. OmniCount distinguishes itself by generating precise object masks and leveraging varied interactive prompts via the Segment Anything Model for efficient counting. To evaluate OmniCount, we created the OmniCount-191 benchmark, a first-of-its-kind dataset with multi-label object counts, including points, bounding boxes, and VQA annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation in OmniCount-191, alongside other leading benchmarks, demonstrates OmniCount's exceptional performance, significantly outpacing existing solutions.

We present QL-Adapter, a framework for multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and significantly outperforms existing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAR-KnowLIP: Towards Multimodal Foundation Models for Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23927v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images. However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT), providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships. (3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11 representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision Language Models are Biased](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23941v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) memorize a vast amount of prior knowledge from the Internet that helps them on downstream tasks but also may notoriously sway their outputs towards wrong or biased answers. In this work, we test how the knowledge about popular subjects hurt the accuracy of vision language models (VLMs) on standard, objective visual tasks of counting and identification. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs are strongly biased (e.g., unable to recognize the 4th stripe has been added to a 3-stripe Adidas logo) scoring an average of 17.05% accuracy in counting (e.g., counting stripes in an Adidas-like logo) across 7 diverse domains from animals, logos, chess, board games, optical illusions, to patterned grids. Removing image backgrounds nearly doubles accuracy (21.09 percentage points), revealing that contextual visual cues trigger these biased responses. Further analysis of VLMs' reasoning patterns shows that counting accuracy initially rises with thinking tokens, reaching ~40%, before declining with excessive reasoning. Our work presents an interesting failure mode in VLMs and a human-supervised automated framework for testing VLM biases.

| **[Training-Free Layout-to-Image Generation with Marginal Attention Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10495v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, many text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-resolution images from text but struggle with precise control over spatial composition and object counting. To address these challenges, prior works developed layout-to-image (L2I) approaches that incorporate layout instructions into text-to-image models. However, existing L2I methods typically require fine-tuning of pre-trained parameters or training additional control modules for the diffusion models. In this work, we propose a training-free L2I approach, MAC (Marginal Attention Constrained Generation), which eliminates the need for additional modules or fine-tuning. Specifically, we use text-visual cross-attention feature maps to quantify inconsistencies between the layout of the generated images and the provided instructions, and then compute loss functions to optimize latent features during the diffusion reverse process. To enhance spatial controllability and mitigate semantic failures in complex layout instructions, we leverage pixel-to-pixel correlations in the self-attention feature maps to align cross-attention maps and combine three loss functions constrained by boundary attention to update latent features. Comprehensive experimental results on both L2I and non-L2I pretrained diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing training-free L2I techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of image composition on the DrawBench and HRS benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

In this task, current open-source models present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5% reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and cost-effective visual captioning solution.</p></details> |  |

Falcon offers a unified, prompt-based paradigm that effectively executes comprehensive and complex remote sensing tasks. Falcon demonstrates powerful understanding and reasoning abilities at the image, region, and pixel levels. Specifically, given simple natural language instructions and remote sensing images, Falcon can produce impressive results in text form across 14 distinct tasks, i.e., image classification, object detection, segmentation, image captioning, and etc. To facilitate Falcon's training and empower its representation capacity to encode rich spatial and semantic information, we developed Falcon_SFT, a large-scale, multi-task, instruction-tuning dataset in the field of remote sensing. The Falcon_SFT dataset consists of approximately 78 million high-quality data samples, covering 5.6 million multi-spatial resolution and multi-view remote sensing images with diverse instructions. It features hierarchical annotations and undergoes manual sampling verification to ensure high data quality and reliability. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted, which verify that Falcon achieves remarkable performance over 67 datasets and 14 tasks, despite having only 0.7B parameters. We release the complete dataset, code, and model weights at https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon, hoping to help further develop the open-source community.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Framework for Open-Vocabulary Zero-Shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16085v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot classification capabilities naturally arise in models trained within a vision-language contrastive framework. Despite their classification prowess, these models struggle in dense tasks like zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation. This deficiency is often attributed to the absence of localization cues in captions and the intertwined nature of the learning process, which encompasses both image representation learning and cross-modality alignment. To tackle these issues, we propose SimZSS, a Simple framework for open-vocabulary Zero-Shot Segmentation. The method is founded on two key principles: i) leveraging frozen vision-only models that exhibit spatial awareness while exclusively aligning the text encoder and ii) exploiting the discrete nature of text and linguistic knowledge to pinpoint local concepts within captions. By capitalizing on the quality of the visual representations, our method requires only image-caption pairs datasets and adapts to both small curated and large-scale noisy datasets. When trained on COCO Captions across 8 GPUs, SimZSS achieves state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 8 benchmark datasets in less than 15 minutes.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; Project Page, Code, and Dataset at: https://merit-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

This separation hinders the joint representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing, we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data, particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models (MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, their reliance on labeled image datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer actively aligns vision and language representation features during training, enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements, producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PMLR and NeurIPS 2025 UniReps</p></details> |

Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable limitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information. To address this constraint, researchers have endeavored to integrate visual capabilities with LLMs, resulting in the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These advanced models are instrumental in tackling more intricate tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. In our comprehensive survey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our classification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated to vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to generate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce multimodal inputs and outputs.This classification is based on their respective capabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various modalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive analysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as its strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of its essential components. We also analyzed the performance of VLMs in various benchmark datasets. By doing so, we aim to offer a nuanced understanding of the diverse landscape of VLMs. Additionally, we underscore potential avenues for future research in this dynamic domain, anticipating further breakthroughs and advancements.</p></details> | <details><summary>One o...</summary><p>One of the first survey on Visual Language Models</p></details> |

However, the principles underlying the construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c) scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes. For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse. Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.</p></details> | 32 pages |

To counter the harmful effects of such technology, the Image Difference Captioning (IDC) task aims to describe the differences between two images. While this task is successfully handled for simple 3D rendered images, it struggles on real-world images. The reason is twofold: the training data-scarcity, and the difficulty to capture fine-grained differences between complex images. To address those issues, we propose in this paper a simple yet effective framework to both adapt existing image captioning models to the IDC task and augment IDC datasets. We introduce BLIP2IDC, an adaptation of BLIP2 to the IDC task at low computational cost, and show it outperforms two-streams approaches by a significant margin on real-world IDC datasets. We also propose to use synthetic augmentation to improve the performance of IDC models in an agnostic fashion. We show that our synthetic augmentation strategy provides high quality data, leading to a challenging new dataset well-suited for IDC named Syned1.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025; Code released at https://github.com/gautierevn/BLIP2IDC</p></details> |

Embedding-based approaches like CLIP enable efficient large-scale retrieval via vector similarity search, but they are primarily trained on literal caption-like text--image pairs and often fail to capture abstract or persona-driven attributes common in product recommendation applications (e.g., ``a gift for a mother who loves gardening''). In contrast, state-of-the-art vision--language models (vLLMs) can align text with images in a flexible manner, but their limited context window prevents them from directly handling retrieval over large catalogs. We propose a framework that distills the preference rankings of a powerful vLLM into an embedding-based system, transferring its nuanced alignment abilities while maintaining the inference-time scalability of an embedding-based approach. Experiments on persona-driven product recommendation tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing embedding-based baselines, providing an efficient solution for personalized text--image retrieval.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm. Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality explanations without task-specific finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICDMW 2025 Workshop on Multimodal AI (MMAI).

However, their multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex multimodal tasks. In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies. Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of MLLMs in real world applications.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we first build lightweight captioning models using a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluate their performance not only on single-sentence but on detailed captioning tasks. We obtain surprising results showing that our model can achieve performance comparable to MLLMs, suggesting its potential to serve as a strong captioning specialist for on-device applications. While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it suffers from occasional captioning errors. We investigate the underlying causes and observe that the problems stem from ineffective attention mechanisms and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality by refining coarse descriptions into more precise captions. At its core, DeepLens improves visual grounding by re-examining the informative regions identified in the initial glance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model over both recent lightweight captioning methods and MLLMs in detailed captioning and even in long-range video QA tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/junha/lightweightcaptioner</p></details> |

Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion: AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, when dealing with specialized cultural heritage domains like 3D vase artifacts, existing models face severe data scarcity issues and insufficient domain knowledge limitations. Due to the lack of targeted training data, current VLMs struggle to effectively handle such culturally significant specialized tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the VaseVQA-3D dataset, which serves as the first 3D visual question answering dataset for ancient Greek pottery analysis, collecting 664 ancient Greek vase 3D models with corresponding question-answer data and establishing a complete data construction pipeline. We further develop the VaseVLM model, enhancing model performance in vase artifact analysis through domain-adaptive training. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, where we improve by 12.8% on R@1 metrics and by 6.6% on lexical similarity compared with previous state-of-the-art on the VaseVQA-3D dataset, significantly improving the recognition and understanding of 3D vase artifacts, providing new technical pathways for digital heritage preservation research.

Second, queries are reasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as diagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a novel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries and documents are constructed as image-text interleaved sequences. Unlike earlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR offers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus documents. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal retrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model Qwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest performance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval models. Although latest multimodal models such as Ops-MM-Embedding perform competitively on expert-domain queries, they fall short on reasoning-intensive tasks. We believe that MRMR paves the way for advancing multimodal retrieval in more realistic and challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Multimodal Model as Auto-Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09666v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of unified multimodal models (UMMs) has long been hindered by a fundamental schism between multimodal understanding and generation. Current approaches typically disentangle the two and treat them as separate endeavors with disjoint objectives, missing the mutual benefits. We argue that true unification requires more than just merging two tasks. It requires a unified, foundational objective that intrinsically links them. In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder lens, i.e., regarding understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. To implement this, we propose UAE, where we begin by pre-training the decoder with the proposed 700k long-context image-caption pairs to direct it to "understand" the fine-grained and complex semantics from the text. We then propose Unified-GRPO via reinforcement learning (RL) to unify the two, which covers two complementary stages: (1) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction quality, enhancing its visual perception; (2) Understanding for Generation, where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and generation fidelity. Our empirical results suggest that understanding can largely enhance generation (verified on GenEval), while generation, in turn, notably strengthens fine-grained visual perception like small object and color recognition (verified on MMT-Bench). This bidirectional improvement reveals a deep synergy: under the unified reconstruction objective, generation and understanding can mutually benefit each other, moving closer to truly unified multimodal intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[RePIC: Reinforced Post-Training for Personalizing Multi-Modal Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18369v4)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.

Recent work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in (vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.</p></details> |  |

However, energy remains a metric that is often overlooked, under-explored, or poorly understood in the context of building ML systems. We present the ML$.$ENERGY Benchmark, a benchmark suite and tool for measuring inference energy consumption under realistic service environments, and the corresponding ML$.$ENERGY Leaderboard, which have served as a valuable resource for those hoping to understand and optimize the energy consumption of their generative AI services. In this paper, we explain four key design principles for benchmarking ML energy we have acquired over time, and then describe how they are implemented in the ML$.$ENERGY Benchmark. We then highlight results from the early 2025 iteration of the benchmark, including energy measurements of 40 widely used model architectures across 6 different tasks, case studies of how ML design choices impact energy consumption, and how automated optimization recommendations can lead to significant (sometimes more than 40%) energy savings without changing what is being computed by the model. The ML$.$ENERGY Benchmark is open-source and can be easily extended to various customized models and application scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS D&B 2025 (Spotlight) | Benchmark: https://github.com/ml-energy/benchmark | Leaderboard: https://ml.energy/leaderboard</p></details> |

One common desired discretization property is moment preservation over a finite dimensional function space, e.g., bounded-degree polynomials. Carath\'{e}odory's theorem asserts that if there is any finitely supported quadrature rule with more nodes than the dimension of the given function space, one can form a smaller (and hence more efficient) positive, nested, quadrature rule that preserves the moments of the original rule. We describe an efficient streaming procedure for Carath\'{e}odory-Steinitz pruning, a numerical procedure that implements Carath\'{e}odory's theorem for this measure compression. The new algorithm makes use of Givens rotations and on-demand storage of arrays to successfully prune very large rules whose storage complexity only depends on the dimension of the function space. This approach improves on a naive implementation of Carath\'{e}odory-Steinitz pruning whose runtime and storage complexity are quadratic and linear, respectively, in the size of the original measure. We additionally prove mathematical stability properties of our method with respect to a set of admissible, total-variation perturbations of the original measure. Our method is compared to two alternate approaches with larger storage requirements: non-negative least squares and linear programming, and we demonstrate comparable runtimes, with improved stability and storage robustness. Finally, we demonstrate practical usage of this algorithm to generate quadrature for discontinous Galerkin finite element simulations on cut-cell meshes.</p></details> |  |

Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are available at https://www.gabriel.fiastre.fr/maskcaptioner/.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Hebbian Principle: Low-Dimensional Structural Projection for Unsupervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14810v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks, demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is available at https://github.com/brain-intelligence-lab/SPHeRe.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Artificial Intelligence for Multi-Tumor Early Detection with More Reports, Fewer Masks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14803v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence (AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly, requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%, surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably, R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate, bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor types. We plan to release our trained models, code, and dataset at https://github.com/MrGiovanni/R-Super</p></details> |  |

We introduce DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

| **[Approaching the Continuous from the Discrete: an Infinite Tensor Product Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14716v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasingly in recent years, probabilistic computation has been investigated through the lenses of categorical algebra, especially via string diagrammatic calculi. Whereas categories of discrete and Gaussian probabilistic processes have been thoroughly studied, with various axiomatisation results, more expressive classes of continuous probability are less understood, because of the intrinsic difficulty of describing infinite behaviour by algebraic means. In this work, we establish a universal construction that adjoins infinite tensor products, allowing continuous probability to be investigated from discrete settings. Our main result applies this construction to $\mathsf{FinStoch}$, the category of finite sets and stochastic matrices, obtaining a category of locally constant Markov kernels, where the objects are finite sets plus the Cantor space $2^{\mathbb{N}}$. Any probability measure on the reals can be reasoned about in this category. Furthermore, we show how to lift axiomatisation results through the infinite tensor product construction. This way we obtain an axiomatic presentation of continuous probability over countable powers of $2=\lbrace 0,1\rbrace$.</p></details> | 22 pages |

Such datasets are naturally described as multi-resolution clusterings, i.e., not necessarily hierarchical sequences of partitions across scales. To analyse and compare such sequences, we use tools from topological data analysis and define the Multiscale Clustering Bifiltration (MCbiF), a 2-parameter filtration of abstract simplicial complexes that encodes cluster intersection patterns across scales. The MCbiF can be interpreted as a higher-order extension of Sankey diagrams and reduces to a dendrogram for hierarchical sequences. We show that the multiparameter persistent homology (MPH) of the MCbiF yields a finitely presented and block decomposable module, and its stable Hilbert functions characterise the topological autocorrelation of the sequence of partitions. In particular, at dimension zero, the MPH captures violations of the refinement order of partitions, whereas at dimension one, the MPH captures higher-order inconsistencies between clusters across scales. We demonstrate through experiments the use of MCbiF Hilbert functions as topological feature maps for downstream machine learning tasks. MCbiF feature maps outperform information-based baseline features on both regression and classification tasks on synthetic sets of non-hierarchical sequences of partitions. We also show an application of MCbiF to real-world data to measure non-hierarchies in wild mice social grouping patterns across time.</p></details> |  |

However, in the context of Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE), the standard sequential scanning mechanism is fundamentally challenged by the unique statistical distribution characteristics of underwater scenes. The predominance of large-portion, homogeneous but useless oceanic backgrounds can dilute the feature representation responses of sparse yet valuable targets, thereby impeding effective state propagation and compromising the model's ability to preserve both local semantics and global structure. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Value-Driven Reordering Scanning framework for UIE, termed VRS-UIE. Its core innovation is a Multi-Granularity Value Guidance Learning (MVGL) module that generates a pixel-aligned value map to dynamically reorder the SSM's scanning sequence. This prioritizes informative regions to facilitate the long-range state propagation of salient features. Building upon the MVGL, we design a Mamba-Conv Mixer (MCM) block that synergistically integrates priority-driven global sequencing with dynamically adjusted local convolutions, thereby effectively modeling both large-portion oceanic backgrounds and high-value semantic targets. A Cross-Feature Bridge (CFB) further refines multi-level feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VRS-UIE framework sets a new state-of-the-art, delivering superior enhancement performance (surpassing WMamba by 0.89 dB on average) by effectively suppressing water bias and preserving structural and color fidelity. Furthermore, by incorporating efficient convolutional operators and resolution rescaling, we construct a light-weight yet effective scheme, VRS-UIE-S, suitable for real-time UIE applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniLens: Towards Universal Lens Aberration Correction via LensLib-to-Specific Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05809v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging universal Computational Aberration Correction (CAC) paradigms provide an inspiring solution to light-weight and high-quality imaging with a universal model trained on a lens library (LensLib) to address arbitrary lens aberrations blindly. However, the limited coverage of existing LensLibs leads to poor generalization of the trained models to unseen lenses, whose fine-tuning pipeline is also confined to the lens-descriptions-known case. In this work, we introduce OmniLens, a flexible solution to universal CAC via (i) establishing a convincing LensLib with comprehensive coverage for pre-training a robust base model, and (ii) adapting the model to any specific lens designs with unknown lens descriptions via fast LensLib-to-specific domain adaptation. To achieve these, an Evolution-based Automatic Optical Design (EAOD) pipeline is proposed to generate a rich variety of lens samples with realistic aberration behaviors. Then, we design an unsupervised regularization term for efficient domain adaptation on a few easily accessible real-captured images based on the statistical observation of dark channel priors in degradation induced by lens aberrations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LensLib generated by EAOD effectively develops a universal CAC model with strong generalization capabilities, which can also improve the non-blind lens-specific methods by 0.35-1.81dB in PSNR. Additionally, the proposed domain adaptation method significantly improves the base model, especially in severe aberration cases (at most 2.59dB in PSNR).

While landmark semantic registration-based methods have shown promising performance improvements in global localization compared with geometric-only methods, landmarks can be repetitive and misleading for correspondence establishment. We propose to mitigate this problem by modeling semantic distributions with continuous functions learned from a population of Gaussian processes. Compared with discrete semantic labels, the continuous functions capture finer-grained geo-semantic information and also provide more detailed metric information for correspondence establishment. We insert this continuous function as the middle layer between the object layer and the metric-semantic layer, forming a tri-layered 3D scene graph, serving as a light-weight yet performant backend for one-shot localization. We term our global localization pipeline Outram-GSF (Gaussian semantic field) and conduct a wide range of experiments on publicly available data sets, validating the superior performance against the current state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are often computationally expensive, and the field lacks standardized benchmarks for fair comparison. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a twofold contribution. First, we develop and open-source FJNDF-Pytorch, a unified benchmark for frequency-domain JND-Guided pre-filters. Second, leveraging this platform, we propose a complete learning framework for a novel, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art compression efficiency, consistently outperforming competitors across multiple datasets and encoders. In terms of computational cost, our model is exceptionally lightweight, requiring only 7.15 GFLOPs to process a 1080p image, which is merely 14.1% of the cost of recent lightweight network.

Beyond accuracy, the approach extracts salient subgraphs and generates natural language explanations, improving interpretability for developers.

| **[LTGS: Long-Term Gaussian Scene Chronology From Sparse View Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09881v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures. However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations, significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines while enabling fast and light-weight updates.</p></details> |  |

Despite their remarkable success, these empirical designs still lack theoretical justifications or interpretations, thus hindering potentially principled improvements. In this paper, we argue that there are fundamental connections between semantic segmentation and compression, especially between the Transformer decoders and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). From such a perspective, we derive a white-box, fully attentional DEcoder for PrIncipled semantiC segemenTation (DEPICT), with the interpretations as follows: 1) the self-attention operator refines image embeddings to construct an ideal principal subspace that aligns with the supervision and retains most information; 2) the cross-attention operator seeks to find a low-rank approximation of the refined image embeddings, which is expected to be a set of orthonormal bases of the principal subspace and corresponds to the predefined classes; 3) the dot-product operation yields compact representation for image embeddings as segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on dataset ADE20K find that DEPICT consistently outperforms its black-box counterpart, Segmenter, and it is light weight and more robust.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2024.

Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection, hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).</p></details> | 14 pages, 17 figures |

Traditional approaches often rely on rule-based or task-specific models, which struggle to generalize across domains and schema variations. In this paper, we present MeXtract, a family of lightweight language models designed for metadata extraction from scientific papers. The models, ranging from 0.5B to 3B parameters, are built by fine-tuning Qwen 2.5 counterparts. In their size family, MeXtract achieves state-of-the-art performance on metadata extraction on the MOLE benchmark. To further support evaluation, we extend the MOLE benchmark to incorporate model-specific metadata, providing an out-of-domain challenging subset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning on a given schema not only yields high accuracy but also transfers effectively to unseen schemas, demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of our approach. We release all the code, datasets, and models openly for the research community.</p></details> |  |

We construct ConGrs using a light-weight lexical sequence alignment algorithm from bioinformatics, supplemented by the targeted usage of a secondary LM judge. Further, we design task-dependent decoding methods to synthesize a single, final response from our ConGr data structure. Our experiments show that synthesizing responses from ConGrs improves factual precision on two biography generation tasks by up to 31% over an average response and reduces reliance on LM judges by more than 80% compared to other methods. We also use ConGrs for three refusal-based tasks requiring abstention on unanswerable queries and find that abstention rate is increased by up to 56%. We apply our approach to the MATH and AIME reasoning tasks and find an improvement over self-verification and majority vote baselines by up to 6 points of accuracy. We show that ConGrs provide a flexible method for capturing variation in LM responses and using the epistemic signals provided by response variation to synthesize more effective responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRISM-Consult: A Panel-of-Experts Architecture for Clinician-Aligned Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01114v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal, Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment standards.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Prompting Robot Teams with Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24575v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a framework towards prompting multi-robot teams with high-level tasks using natural language expressions. Our objective is to use the reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in understanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these for multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an individual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and must continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework that possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and semantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time operation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and sequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an RNN, and align its internal states with the semantics of a given task. By training a graph neural network (GNN) control policy that is conditioned on the hidden states of the RNN and the language embeddings, our method enables robots to execute task-relevant actions in a decentralized manner. We present evaluations of this single light-weight interpretable model on various simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks that require sequential and collaborative behavior by the team -- sites.google.com/view/prompting-teams.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination reduction with CASAL: Contrastive Activation Steering For Amortized Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02324v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations. These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning (CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by 30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment in production systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[EfficienT-HDR: An Efficient Transformer-Based Framework via Multi-Exposure Fusion for HDR Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19779v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving high-quality High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging on resource-constrained edge devices is a critical challenge in computer vision, as its performance directly impacts downstream tasks such as intelligent surveillance and autonomous driving. Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts, hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and practicality across various dynamic scenarios.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

Current radar imaging methods, however, rely on synthetic aperture or multi-frame aggregation to improve resolution, which is impractical for small aerial, inspection, or wearable systems. We present RadarSFD, a conditional latent diffusion framework that reconstructs dense LiDAR-like point clouds from a single radar frame without motion or SAR. Our approach transfers geometric priors from a pretrained monocular depth estimator into the diffusion backbone, anchors them to radar inputs via channel-wise latent concatenation, and regularizes outputs with a dual-space objective combining latent and pixel-space losses. On the RadarHD benchmark, RadarSFD achieves 35 cm Chamfer Distance and 28 cm Modified Hausdorff Distance, improving over the single-frame RadarHD baseline (56 cm, 45 cm) and remaining competitive with multi-frame methods using 5-41 frames. Qualitative results show recovery of fine walls and narrow gaps, and experiments across new environments confirm strong generalization. Ablation studies highlight the importance of pretrained initialization, radar BEV conditioning, and the dual-space loss. Together, these results establish the first practical single-frame, no-SAR mmWave radar pipeline for dense point cloud perception in compact robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel approach to generating synthetic tabular data based on the principle of maximum entropy -- MaxEnt -- called GEM-T, for ``generative entropy maximization for tables.'' GEM-T directly captures nth-order interactions -- pairwise, third-order, etc. -- among columns of training data. In extensive testing, GEM-T matches or exceeds deep neural network approaches previously regarded as state-of-the-art in 23 of 34 publicly available datasets representing diverse subject domains (68\%). Notably, GEM-T involves orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable parameters, demonstrating that much of the information in real-world data resides in low-dimensional, potentially human-interpretable correlations, provided that the input data is appropriately transformed first. Furthermore, MaxEnt better handles heterogeneous data types (continuous vs. discrete vs. categorical), lack of local structure, and other features of tabular data. GEM-T represents a promising direction for light-weight high-performance generative models for structured data.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

Conventional manual microscopy methods suffer from time inefficiency and diagnostic inaccuracies. Existing automated detection approaches remain constrained by high deployment costs and suboptimal accuracy. While deep learning has introduced powerful paradigms to this field, persistent challenges in detecting overlapping cells and multi-scale objects hinder practical deployment. This study proposes the multi-scale YOLO (MS-YOLO), a blood cell detection model based on the YOLOv11 framework, incorporating three key architectural innovations to enhance detection performance. Specifically, the multi-scale dilated residual module (MS-DRM) replaces the original C3K2 modules to improve multi-scale discriminability; the dynamic cross-path feature enhancement module (DCFEM) enables the fusion of hierarchical features from the backbone with aggregated features from the neck to enhance feature representations; and the light adaptive-weight downsampling module (LADS) improves feature downsampling through adaptive spatial weighting while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the CBC benchmark demonstrate that MS-YOLO achieves precise detection of overlapping cells and multi-scale objects, particularly small targets such as platelets, achieving an mAP@50 of 97.4% that outperforms existing models. Further validation on the supplementary WBCDD dataset confirms its robust generalization capability. Additionally, with a lightweight architecture and real-time inference efficiency, MS-YOLO meets clinical deployment requirements, providing reliable technical support for standardized blood pathology assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There is a disagreement among the authors regarding the content and submission of the manuscript, which needs to be resolved before it can be made public</p></details> |

Recent advancements in Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation have leveraged positional conditions and textual descriptions to facilitate precise and controllable image synthesis. Despite overall progress, current L2I methods still exhibit suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose InstanceAssemble, a novel architecture that incorporates layout conditions via instance-assembling attention, enabling position control with bounding boxes (bbox) and multimodal content control including texts and additional visual content. Our method achieves flexible adaption to existing DiT-based T2I models through light-weighted LoRA modules. Additionally, we propose a Layout-to-Image benchmark, Denselayout, a comprehensive benchmark for layout-to-image generation, containing 5k images with 90k instances in total. We further introduce Layout Grounding Score (LGS), an interpretable evaluation metric to more precisely assess the accuracy of L2I generation. Experiments demonstrate that our InstanceAssemble method achieves state-of-the-art performance under complex layout conditions, while exhibiting strong compatibility with diverse style LoRA modules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Importantly, the learner is required to extend and update its knowledge without forgetting about the learning experience acquired from the past, and while avoiding the need to retrain from scratch. Given its sequential nature and its resemblance to the way humans think, continual learning offers an opportunity to address several challenges which currently stand in the way of widening the range of applicability of deep models to further real-world problems. The continual need to update the learner with data arriving sequentially strikes inherent congruence between continual learning and Bayesian inference which provides a principal platform to keep updating the prior beliefs of a model given new data, without completely forgetting the knowledge acquired from the old data. This survey inspects different settings of Bayesian continual learning, namely task-incremental learning and class-incremental learning. We begin by discussing definitions of continual learning along with its Bayesian setting, as well as the links with related fields, such as domain adaptation, transfer learning and meta-learning. Afterwards, we introduce a taxonomy offering a comprehensive categorization of algorithms belonging to the Bayesian continual learning paradigm. Meanwhile, we analyze the state-of-the-art while zooming in on some of the most prominent Bayesian continual learning algorithms to date. Furthermore, we shed some light on links between continual learning and developmental psychology, and correspondingly introduce analogies between both fields. We follow that with a discussion of current challenges, and finally conclude with potential areas for future research on Bayesian continual learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Classifier Synergy: Reward-Aligned Learning via Mutual Boosting Loop for FSCIL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03608v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation, their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[FedGTEA: Federated Class-Incremental Learning with Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12927v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning, called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings, aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting, consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modular Embedding Recomposition for Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16463v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 36th British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC 2025), Sheffield, UK</p></details> |
| **[Resource-Constrained Federated Continual Learning: What Does Matter?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08737v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Continual Learning (FCL) aims to enable sequentially privacy-preserving model training on streams of incoming data that vary in edge devices by preserving previous knowledge while adapting to new data. Current FCL literature focuses on restricted data privacy and access to previously seen data while imposing no constraints on the training overhead. This is unreasonable for FCL applications in real-world scenarios, where edge devices are primarily constrained by resources such as storage, computational budget, and label rate. We revisit this problem with a large-scale benchmark and analyze the performance of state-of-the-art FCL approaches under different resource-constrained settings. Various typical FCL techniques and six datasets in two incremental learning scenarios (Class-IL and Domain-IL) are involved in our experiments. Through extensive experiments amounting to a total of over 1,000+ GPU hours, we find that, under limited resource-constrained settings, existing FCL approaches, with no exception, fail to achieve the expected performance. Our conclusions are consistent in the sensitivity analysis. This suggests that most existing FCL methods are particularly too resource-dependent for real-world deployment. Moreover, we study the performance of typical FCL techniques with resource constraints and shed light on future research directions in FCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.11165 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[DRL: Discriminative Representation Learning with Parallel Adapters for Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12107v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs), remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference phases.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Your VAR Model is Secretly an Efficient and Explainable Generative Classifier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12060v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

The introduction of pre-trained models has brought new tuning paradigms to CIL. In this paper, we revisit different parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods within the context of continual learning. We observe that adapter tuning demonstrates superiority over prompt-based methods, even without parameter expansion in each learning session. Motivated by this, we propose incrementally tuning the shared adapter without imposing parameter update constraints, enhancing the learning capacity of the backbone. Additionally, we employ feature sampling from stored prototypes to retrain a unified classifier, further improving its performance. We estimate the semantic shift of old prototypes without access to past samples and update stored prototypes session by session. Our proposed method eliminates model expansion and avoids retaining any image samples. It surpasses previous pre-trained model-based CIL methods and demonstrates remarkable continual learning capabilities. Experimental results on five CIL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal extension of SSIAT (CVPR 2024)</p></details> |

However, the scenario becomes particularly challenging when data samples are insufficient, requiring on-device few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) to maintain consistent model performance. Although existing work has explored parameter-efficient FSCIL frameworks based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), their deployment is still fundamentally constrained by limited device resources. Inspired by neural mechanisms, Spiking neural networks (SNNs) process spatiotemporal information efficiently, offering lower energy consumption, greater biological plausibility, and compatibility with neuromorphic hardware than ANNs. In this work, we present an SNN-based method for On-Device FSCIL, i.e., Sparsity-Aware and Fast Adaptive SNN (SAFA-SNN). We first propose sparsity-conditioned neuronal dynamics, in which most neurons remain stable while a subset stays active, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further cope with spike non-differentiability in gradient estimation, we employ zeroth-order optimization. Moreover, during incremental learning sessions, we enhance the discriminability of new classes through subspace projection, which alleviates overfitting to novel classes. Extensive experiments conducted on two standard benchmark datasets (CIFAR100 and Mini-ImageNet) and three neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR-10-DVS, DVS128gesture, and N-Caltech101) demonstrate that SAFA-SNN outperforms baseline methods, specifically achieving at least 4.01% improvement at the last incremental session on Mini-ImageNet and 20% lower energy cost over baseline methods with practical implementation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we consider the challenging Cold Start scenario in which insufficient data is available in the first task to learn a high-quality backbone. This is especially challenging for EFCIL since it requires high plasticity, resulting in feature drift which is difficult to compensate for in the exemplar-free setting. To address this problem, we propose an effective approach to consolidate feature representations by regularizing drift in directions highly relevant to previous tasks while employing prototypes to reduce task-recency bias. Our approach, which we call Elastic Feature Consolidation++ (EFC++) exploits a tractable second-order approximation of feature drift based on a proposed Empirical Feature Matrix (EFM). The EFM induces a pseudo-metric in feature space which we use to regularize feature drift in important directions and to update Gaussian prototypes. In addition, we introduce a post-training prototype re-balancing phase that updates classifiers to compensate for feature drift. Experimental results on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-Subset, ImageNet-1K and DomainNet demonstrate that EFC++ is better able to learn new tasks by maintaining model plasticity and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of our previous conference paper https://openreview.net/forum?id=7D9X2cFnt1</p></details> |
| **[Forget Forgetting: Continual Learning in a World of Abundant Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07274v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) has traditionally focused on minimizing exemplar memory, a constraint often misaligned with modern systems where GPU time, not storage, is the primary bottleneck. This paper challenges this paradigm by investigating a more realistic regime: one where memory is abundant enough to mitigate forgetting, but full retraining from scratch remains prohibitively expensive. In this practical "middle ground", we find that the core challenge shifts from stability to plasticity, as models become biased toward prior tasks and struggle to learn new ones. Conversely, improved stability allows simple replay baselines to outperform the state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the GPU cost. To address this newly surfaced trade-off, we propose Weight Space Consolidation, a lightweight method that combines (1) rank-based parameter resets to restore plasticity with (2) weight averaging to enhance stability. Validated on both class-incremental learning with image classifiers and continual instruction tuning with large language models, our approach outperforms strong baselines while matching the low computational cost of replay, offering a scalable alternative to expensive full-retraining. These findings challenge long-standing CL assumptions and establish a new, cost-efficient baseline for real-world CL systems where exemplar memory is no longer the limiting factor.</p></details> | 24 pages, 11 figures |
| **[StPR: Spatiotemporal Preservation and Routing for Exemplar-Free Video Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13997v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Class-Incremental Learning (VCIL) seeks to develop models that continuously learn new action categories over time without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Unlike traditional Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), VCIL introduces the added complexity of spatiotemporal structures, making it particularly challenging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while effectively capturing both frame-shared semantics and temporal dynamics. Existing approaches either rely on exemplar rehearsal, raising concerns over memory and privacy, or adapt static image-based methods that neglect temporal modeling. To address these limitations, we propose Spatiotemporal Preservation and Routing (StPR), a unified and exemplar-free VCIL framework that explicitly disentangles and preserves spatiotemporal information. First, we introduce Frame-Shared Semantics Distillation (FSSD), which identifies semantically stable and meaningful channels by jointly considering semantic sensitivity and classification contribution. These important semantic channels are selectively regularized to maintain prior knowledge while allowing for adaptation. Second, we design a Temporal Decomposition-based Mixture-of-Experts (TD-MoE), which dynamically routes task-specific experts based on their temporal dynamics, enabling inference without task ID or stored exemplars. Together, StPR effectively leverages spatial semantics and temporal dynamics, achieving a unified, exemplar-free VCIL framework. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics400 show that our method outperforms existing baselines while offering improved interpretability and efficiency in VCIL.

| **[EMO-TTA: Improving Test-Time Adaptation of Audio-Language Models for Speech Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25495v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech emotion recognition (SER) with audio-language models (ALMs) remains vulnerable to distribution shifts at test time, leading to performance degradation in out-of-domain scenarios. Test-time adaptation (TTA) provides a promising solution but often relies on gradient-based updates or prompt tuning, limiting flexibility and practicality. We propose Emo-TTA, a lightweight, training-free adaptation framework that incrementally updates class-conditional statistics via an Expectation-Maximization procedure for explicit test-time distribution estimation, using ALM predictions as priors. Emo-TTA operates on individual test samples without modifying model weights. Experiments on six out-of-domain SER benchmarks show consistent accuracy improvements over prior TTA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of statistical adaptation in aligning model predictions with evolving test distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Avoid Catastrophic Forgetting with Rank-1 Fisher from Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23593v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation (EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1 variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular, forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks, while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.</p></details> | 18 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Toward a Holistic Approach to Continual Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23592v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular, conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information. Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Workshop on Continual Learning in Computer Vision, ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[DDP: Dual-Decoupled Prompting for Multi-Label Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23335v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10 benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Synthetic Replays: Turning Diffusion Features into Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23402v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely limited training data while requiring models to acquire new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. Recent works have explored generative models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), to address these challenges. However, existing approaches use SD mainly as a replay generator, whereas we demonstrate that SD's rich multi-scale representations can serve as a unified backbone. Motivated by this observation, we introduce Diffusion-FSCIL, which extracts four synergistic feature types from SD by capturing real image characteristics through inversion, providing semantic diversity via class-conditioned synthesis, enhancing generalization through controlled noise injection, and enabling replay without image storage through generative features. Unlike conventional approaches requiring synthetic buffers and separate classification backbones, our unified framework operates entirely in the latent space with only lightweight networks ($\approx$6M parameters). Extensive experiments on CUB-200, miniImageNet, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with comprehensive ablations confirming the necessity of each feature type. Furthermore, we confirm that our streamlined variant maintains competitive accuracy while substantially improving efficiency, establishing the viability of generative models as practical and effective backbones for FSCIL.</p></details> | pre-print ver 2 |
| **[Hierarchical Representation Matching for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22645v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as "a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details. Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Lie of the Average: How Class Incremental Learning Evaluation Deceives You?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22580v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking.

| **[Activation Function Design Sustains Plasticity in Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22562v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings: (i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.</p></details> |  |
