| **[On Multilevel Energy-Based Fragmentation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12467v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy-based fragmentation methods approximate the potential energy of a molecular system as a sum of contribution terms built from the energies of particular subsystems. Some such methods reduce to truncations of the many-body expansion (MBE); others combine subsystem energies in a manner inspired by the principle of inclusion/exclusion (PIE). The combinatorial technique of M\"obius inversion of sums over partially ordered sets, which generalizes the PIE, is known to provide a non-recursive expression for the MBE contribution terms, and has also been connected to related cluster expansion methods. We build from these ideas a very general framework for decomposing potential functions into energetic contribution terms associated with elements of particular partially ordered sets (posets) and direct products thereof. Specific choices immediately reproduce not only the MBE, but also a number of other existing decomposition forms, including, e.g., the multilevel ML-BOSSANOVA schema. Furthermore, a different choice of poset product leads to a setup familiar from the combination technique for high-dimensional approximation, which has a known connection to quantum-chemical composite methods. We present the ML-SUPANOVA decomposition form, which allows the further refinement of the terms of an MBE-like expansion of the Born-Oppenheimer potential according to systematic hierarchies of ab initio methods and of basis sets. We outline an adaptive algorithm for the a posteori construction of quasi-optimal truncations of this decomposition. Some initial experiments are reported and discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Roto-Translation Invariant Metrics on Position-Orientation Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03309v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Riemannian metrics on the position-orientation space M(3) that are roto-translation group SE(3) invariant play a key role in image analysis tasks like enhancement, denoising, and segmentation. These metrics enable roto-translation equivariant algorithms, with the associated Riemannian distance often used in implementation. However, computing the Riemannian distance is costly, which makes it unsuitable in situations where constant recomputation is needed. We propose the mav (minimal angular velocity) distance, defined as the Riemannian length of a geometrically meaningful curve, as a practical alternative. We see an application of the mav distance in geometric deep learning. Namely, neural networks architectures such as PONITA, relies on geometric invariants to create their roto-translation equivariant model. The mav distance offers a trainable invariant, with the parameters that determine the Riemannian metric acting as learnable weights. In this paper we: 1) classify and parametrize all SE(3) invariant metrics on M(3), 2) describes how to efficiently calculate the mav distance, and 3) investigate if including the mav distance within PONITA can positively impact its accuracy in predicting molecular properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Collection of Euclidean Invariants between Pairs of Position-Orientations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03299v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Euclidean E(3) equivariant neural networks that employ scalar fields on position-orientation space M(3) have been effectively applied to tasks such as predicting molecular dynamics and properties. To perform equivariant convolutional-like operations in these architectures one needs Euclidean invariant kernels on M(3) x M(3). In practice, a handcrafted collection of invariants is selected, and this collection is then fed into multilayer perceptrons to parametrize the kernels. We rigorously describe an optimal collection of 4 smooth scalar invariants on the whole of M(3) x M(3). With optimal we mean that the collection is independent and universal, meaning that all invariants are pertinent, and any invariant kernel is a function of them. We evaluate two collections of invariants, one universal and one not, using the PONITA neural network architecture. Our experiments show that using a collection of invariants that is universal positively impacts the accuracy of PONITA significantly.</p></details> |  |
| **[JanusDDG: A Thermodynamics-Compliant Model for Sequence-Based Protein Stability via Two-Fronts Multi-Head Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03278v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how residue variations affect protein stability is crucial for designing functional proteins and deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying disease-related mutations. Recent advances in protein language models (PLMs) have revolutionized computational protein analysis, enabling, among other things, more accurate predictions of mutational effects. In this work, we introduce JanusDDG, a deep learning framework that leverages PLM-derived embeddings and a bidirectional cross-attention transformer architecture to predict $\Delta \Delta G$ of single and multiple-residue mutations while simultaneously being constrained to respect fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as antisymmetry and transitivity. Unlike conventional self-attention, JanusDDG computes queries (Q) and values (V) as the difference between wild-type and mutant embeddings, while keys (K) alternate between the two. This cross-interleaved attention mechanism enables the model to capture mutation-induced perturbations while preserving essential contextual information. Experimental results show that JanusDDG achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting $\Delta \Delta G$ from sequence alone, matching or exceeding the accuracy of structure-based methods for both single and multiple mutations.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[UniGEM: A Unified Approach to Generation and Property Prediction for Molecules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10516v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular generation and molecular property prediction are both crucial for drug discovery, but they are often developed independently. Inspired by recent studies, which demonstrate that diffusion model, a prominent generative approach, can learn meaningful data representations that enhance predictive tasks, we explore the potential for developing a unified generative model in the molecular domain that effectively addresses both molecular generation and property prediction tasks. However, the integration of these tasks is challenging due to inherent inconsistencies, making simple multi-task learning ineffective. To address this, we propose UniGEM, the first unified model to successfully integrate molecular generation and property prediction, delivering superior performance in both tasks. Our key innovation lies in a novel two-phase generative process, where predictive tasks are activated in the later stages, after the molecular scaffold is formed. We further enhance task balance through innovative training strategies. Rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in both tasks. The principles behind UniGEM hold promise for broader applications, including natural language processing and computer vision.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[BondMatcher: H-Bond Stability Analysis in Molecular Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03205v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This application paper investigates the stability of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), as characterized by the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM). First, we contribute a database of 4544 electron densities associated to four isomers of water hexamers (the so-called Ring, Book, Cage and Prism), generated by distorting their equilibrium geometry under various structural perturbations, modeling the natural dynamic behavior of molecular systems. Second, we present a new stability measure, called bond occurrence rate, associating each bond path present at equilibrium with its rate of occurrence within the input ensemble. We also provide an algorithm, called BondMatcher, for its automatic computation, based on a tailored, geometry-aware partial isomorphism estimation between the extremum graphs of the considered electron densities. Our new stability measure allows for the automatic identification of densities lacking H-bond paths, enabling further visual inspections. Specifically, the topological analysis enabled by our framework corroborates experimental observations and provides refined geometrical criteria for characterizing the disappearance of H-bond paths. Our electron density database and our C++ implementation are available at this address: https://github.com/thom-dani/BondMatcher.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Connection Between Diffusion Models and Molecular Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03187v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modelling atomic interactions with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Recently, denoising diffusion models have shown promise in NNPs by training networks to remove noise added to stable configurations, eliminating the need for force data during training. In this work, we explore the connection between noise and forces by providing a new, simplified mathematical derivation of their relationship. We also demonstrate how a denoising model can be implemented using a conventional MD software package interfaced with a standard NNP architecture. We demonstrate the approach by training a diffusion-based NNP to simulate a coarse-grained lithium chloride solution and employ data duplication to enhance model performance.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[AD-GPT: Large Language Models in Alzheimer's Disease](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03071v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for medical information retrieval, yet their accuracy and depth remain limited in specialized domains such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), a growing global health challenge. To address this gap, we introduce AD-GPT, a domain-specific generative pre-trained transformer designed to enhance the retrieval and analysis of AD-related genetic and neurobiological information. AD-GPT integrates diverse biomedical data sources, including potential AD-associated genes, molecular genetic information, and key gene variants linked to brain regions. We develop a stacked LLM architecture combining Llama3 and BERT, optimized for four critical tasks in AD research: (1) genetic information retrieval, (2) gene-brain region relationship assessment, (3) gene-AD relationship analysis, and (4) brain region-AD relationship mapping. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate AD-GPT's superior precision and reliability across these tasks, underscoring its potential as a robust and specialized AI tool for advancing AD research and biomarker discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Counterfactual Truthfulness for Molecular Property Prediction through Uncertainty Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02606v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable AI (xAI) interventions aim to improve interpretability for complex black-box models, not only to improve user trust but also as a means to extract scientific insights from high-performing predictive systems. In molecular property prediction, counterfactual explanations offer a way to understand predictive behavior by highlighting which minimal perturbations in the input molecular structure cause the greatest deviation in the predicted property. However, such explanations only allow for meaningful scientific insights if they reflect the distribution of the true underlying property -- a feature we define as counterfactual truthfulness. To increase this truthfulness, we propose the integration of uncertainty estimation techniques to filter counterfactual candidates with high predicted uncertainty. Through computational experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that traditional uncertainty estimation methods, such as ensembles and mean-variance estimation, can already substantially reduce the average prediction error and increase counterfactual truthfulness, especially for out-of-distribution settings. Our results highlight the importance and potential impact of incorporating uncertainty estimation into explainability methods, especially considering the relatively high effectiveness of low-effort interventions like model ensembles.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 4 tabels, accepted at the 3rd xAI World Conference</p></details> |
| **[Towards Unified Latent Space for 3D Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15567v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolX: Enhancing Large Language Models for Molecular Learning with A Multi-Modal Extension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06777v5)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with their strong task-handling capabilities have shown remarkable advancements across a spectrum of fields, moving beyond natural language understanding. However, their proficiency within the chemistry domain remains restricted, especially in solving professional molecule-related tasks. This challenge is attributed to their inherent limitations in comprehending molecules using only common textual representations, i.e., SMILES strings. In this study, we seek to enhance the ability of LLMs to comprehend molecules by equipping them with a multi-modal external module, namely MolX. In particular, instead of directly using a SMILES string to represent a molecule, we utilize specific encoders to extract fine-grained features from both SMILES string and 2D molecular graph representations for feeding into an LLM. Moreover, a handcrafted molecular fingerprint is incorporated to leverage its embedded domain knowledge. Then, to establish an alignment between MolX and the LLM's textual input space, the whole model in which the LLM is frozen, is pre-trained with a versatile strategy including a diverse set of tasks. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed method outperforms baselines across 4 downstream molecule-related tasks ranging from molecule-to-text translation to retrosynthesis, with and without fine-tuning the LLM, while only introducing a small number of trainable parameters 0.53% and 0.82%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[QuantumBind-RBFE: Accurate Relative Binding Free Energy Calculations Using Neural Network Potentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01811v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities is crucial in drug discovery, particularly during hit-to-lead and lead optimization phases, however, limitations in ligand force fields continue to impact prediction accuracy. In this work, we validate relative binding free energy (RBFE) accuracy using neural network potentials (NNPs) for the ligands. We utilize a novel NNP model, AceFF 1.0, based on the TensorNet architecture for small molecules that broadens the applicability to diverse drug-like compounds, including all important chemical elements and supporting charged molecules. Using established benchmarks, we show overall improved accuracy and correlation in binding affinity predictions compared with GAFF2 for molecular mechanics and ANI2-x for NNPs. Slightly less accuracy but comparable correlations with OPLS4. We also show that we can run the NNP simulations at 2 fs timestep, at least two times larger than previous NNP models, providing significant speed gains. The results show promise for further evolutions of free energy calculations using NNPs while demonstrating its practical use already with the current generation. The code and NNP model are publicly available for research use.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Finding All Connected Maximum-Sized Common Subgraphs in Multiple Labeled Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22368v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an exact algorithm for computing all common subgraphs with the maximum number of vertices across multiple graphs. Our approach is further extended to handle the connected Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS), identifying the largest common subgraph in terms of either vertices or edges across multiple graphs, where edges or vertices may additionally be labeled to account for possible atom types or bond types, a classical labeling used in molecular graphs. Our approach leverages modular product graphs and a modified Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to enumerate maximal cliques, ensuring all intermediate solutions are retained. A pruning heuristic efficiently reduces the modular product size, improving computational feasibility. Additionally, we introduce a graph ordering strategy based on graph-kernel similarity measures to optimize the search process. Our method is particularly relevant for bioinformatics and cheminformatics, where identifying conserved structural motifs in molecular graphs is crucial. Empirical results on molecular datasets demonstrate that our approach is scalable and fast.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trustworthy Enhanced Multi-view Multi-modal Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Brain-wide Imaging Transcriptomics Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14977v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain transcriptomics provides insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the brain coordinates its functions and processes. However, existing multimodal methods for predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) primarily rely on imaging and sometimes genetic data, often neglecting the transcriptomic basis of brain. Furthermore, while striving to integrate complementary information between modalities, most studies overlook the informativeness disparities between modalities. Here, we propose TMM, a trusted multiview multimodal graph attention framework for AD diagnosis, using extensive brain-wide transcriptomics and imaging data. First, we construct view-specific brain regional co-function networks (RRIs) from transcriptomics and multimodal radiomics data to incorporate interaction information from both biomolecular and imaging perspectives. Next, we apply graph attention (GAT) processing to each RRI network to produce graph embeddings and employ cross-modal attention to fuse transcriptomics-derived embedding with each imagingderived embedding. Finally, a novel true-false-harmonized class probability (TFCP) strategy is designed to assess and adaptively adjust the prediction confidence of each modality for AD diagnosis. We evaluate TMM using the AHBA database with brain-wide transcriptomics data and the ADNI database with three imaging modalities (AV45-PET, FDG-PET, and VBM-MRI). The results demonstrate the superiority of our method in identifying AD, EMCI, and LMCI compared to state-of-the-arts. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Yaolab-fantastic/TMM.</p></details> |  |
| **[De Novo Molecular Design Enabled by Direct Preference Optimization and Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01389v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>De novo molecular design has extensive applications in drug discovery and materials science. The vast chemical space renders direct molecular searches computationally prohibitive, while traditional experimental screening is both time- and labor-intensive. Efficient molecular generation and screening methods are therefore essential for accelerating drug discovery and reducing costs. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to optimize molecular properties via reward mechanisms, its practical utility is limited by issues in training efficiency, convergence, and stability. To address these challenges, we adopt Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) from NLP, which uses molecular score-based sample pairs to maximize the likelihood difference between high- and low-quality molecules, effectively guiding the model toward better compounds. Moreover, integrating curriculum learning further boosts training efficiency and accelerates convergence. A systematic evaluation of the proposed method on the GuacaMol Benchmark yielded excellent scores. For instance, the method achieved a score of 0.883 on the Perindopril MPO task, representing a 6\% improvement over competing models. And subsequent target protein binding experiments confirmed its practical efficacy. These results demonstrate the strong potential of DPO for molecular design tasks and highlight its effectiveness as a robust and efficient solution for data-driven drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-context Protein Language Modeling Using Bidirectional Mamba with Shared Projection Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08909v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised training of language models (LMs) has seen great success for protein sequences in learning meaningful representations and for generative drug design. Most protein LMs are based on the Transformer architecture trained on individual proteins with short context lengths. Such protein LMs cannot extrapolate to longer proteins and protein complexes well. They also fail to account for the underlying biological mechanisms carried out by biomolecular interactions and dynamics i.e., proteins often interact with other proteins, molecules, and pathways in complex biological systems. In this work, we propose LC-PLM based on an alternative protein LM architecture, BiMamba-S, built upon selective structured state-space models, to learn high-quality universal protein representations at the amino acid token level using masked language modeling. We also introduce its graph-contextual variant, LC-PLM, which contextualizes protein-protein interaction (PPI) graphs for a second stage of training. LC-PLM demonstrates favorable neural scaling laws, better length extrapolation capability, and up to 30% and 16% improvements on protein downstream tasks compared to Transformer-based ESM-2 when trained with 100B and 1T tokens, respectively. LC-PLM-G further trained within the context of PPI graphs shows promising results on protein structure and function prediction tasks. Our study demonstrates the benefit of increasing the context size with computationally efficient LM architecture (e.g., structured state space models) in learning universal protein representations and incorporating molecular interaction contexts contained in biological graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>model...</summary><p>model weights open-sourced at https://github.com/amazon-science/LC-PLM</p></details> |
| **[BIOMEDICA: An Open Biomedical Image-Caption Archive, Dataset, and Vision-Language Models Derived from Scientific Literature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07171v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of vision-language models (VLMs) is driven by large-scale and diverse multimodal datasets. However, progress toward generalist biomedical VLMs is limited by the lack of annotated, publicly accessible datasets across biology and medicine. Existing efforts are restricted to narrow domains, missing the full diversity of biomedical knowledge encoded in scientific literature. To address this gap, we introduce BIOMEDICA, a scalable, open-source framework to extract, annotate, and serialize the entirety of the PubMed Central Open Access subset into an easy-to-use, publicly accessible dataset. Our framework produces a comprehensive archive with over 24 million unique image-text pairs from over 6 million articles. Metadata and expert-guided annotations are also provided. We demonstrate the utility and accessibility of our resource by releasing BMCA-CLIP, a suite of CLIP-style models continuously pre-trained on the BIOMEDICA dataset via streaming, eliminating the need to download 27 TB of data locally. On average, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across 40 tasks - spanning pathology, radiology, ophthalmology, dermatology, surgery, molecular biology, parasitology, and cell biology - excelling in zero-shot classification with a 6.56% average improvement (as high as 29.8% and 17.5% in dermatology and ophthalmology, respectively), and stronger image-text retrieval, all while using 10x less compute. To foster reproducibility and collaboration, we release our codebase and dataset for the broader research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating drug discovery with Artificial: a whole-lab orchestration and scheduling system for self-driving labs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00986v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-driving labs are transforming drug discovery by enabling automated, AI-guided experimentation, but they face challenges in orchestrating complex workflows, integrating diverse instruments and AI models, and managing data efficiently. Artificial addresses these issues with a comprehensive orchestration and scheduling system that unifies lab operations, automates workflows, and integrates AI-driven decision-making. By incorporating AI/ML models like NVIDIA BioNeMo - which facilitates molecular interaction prediction and biomolecular analysis - Artificial enhances drug discovery and accelerates data-driven research. Through real-time coordination of instruments, robots, and personnel, the platform streamlines experiments, enhances reproducibility, and advances drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Scale Multi-omic Biosequence Transformers for Modeling Protein-Nucleic Acid Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16245v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transformer architecture has revolutionized bioinformatics and driven progress in the understanding and prediction of the properties of biomolecules. Almost all research on large-scale biosequence transformers has focused on one domain at a time (single-omic), usually DNA/RNA or proteins. These models have seen incredible success in downstream tasks in each domain, and have achieved particularly noteworthy breakthroughs in sequence modeling and structural modeling. However, these single-omic models are naturally incapable of efficiently modeling multi-omic tasks, one of the most biologically critical being protein-nucleic acid interactions. We present our work training the largest open-source multi-omic foundation model to date. We show that these multi-omic models (MOMs) can learn joint representations between various single-omic distributions that are emergently consistent with the Central Dogma of molecular biology despite only being trained on unlabeled biosequences. We further demonstrate that MOMs can be fine-tuned to achieve state-of-the-art results on protein-nucleic acid interaction tasks, namely predicting the change in Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G$) of the binding interaction between a given nucleic acid and protein. Remarkably, we show that multi-omic biosequence transformers emergently learn useful structural information without any \textit{a priori} structural training, allowing us to predict which protein residues are most involved in the protein-nucleic acid binding interaction. Lastly, we provide evidence that multi-omic biosequence models are in many cases superior to foundation models trained on single-omics distributions, both in performance-per-FLOP and absolute performance, suggesting a more generalized or foundational approach to building these models for biology.</p></details> | 39 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Large Language Models are In-Context Molecule Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04197v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in biochemical tasks, especially the molecule caption translation task, which aims to bridge the gap between molecules and natural language texts. However, previous methods in adapting LLMs to the molecule-caption translation task required extra domain-specific pre-training stages, suffered weak alignment between molecular and textual spaces, or imposed stringent demands on the scale of LLMs. To resolve the challenges, we propose In-Context Molecule Adaptation (ICMA), as a new paradigm allowing LLMs to learn the molecule-text alignment from context examples via In-Context Molecule Tuning. Specifically, ICMA incorporates the following three stages: Hybrid Context Retrieval, Post-retrieval Re-ranking, and In-context Molecule Tuning. Initially, Hybrid Context Retrieval utilizes BM25 Caption Retrieval and Molecule Graph Retrieval to retrieve similar informative context examples. Additionally, Post-retrieval Re-ranking is composed of Sequence Reversal and Random Walk selection to further improve the quality of retrieval results. Finally, In-Context Molecule Tuning unlocks the in-context learning and reasoning capability of LLMs with the retrieved examples and adapts the parameters of LLMs for better alignment between molecules and texts. Experimental results demonstrate that ICMA can empower LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art or comparable performance without extra training corpora and intricate structures, showing that LLMs are inherently in-context molecule learners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TKDE</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Learning for Molecular Communication in Internet of Bio-Nano Things](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08426v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular communication (MC) provides a foundational framework for information transmission in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), where efficiency and reliability are crucial. However, the inherent limitations of molecular channels, such as low transmission rates, noise, and intersymbol interference (ISI), limit their ability to support complex data transmission. This paper proposes an end-to-end semantic learning framework designed to optimize task-oriented molecular communication, with a focus on biomedical diagnostic tasks under resource-constrained conditions. The proposed framework employs a deep encoder-decoder architecture to efficiently extract, quantize, and decode semantic features, prioritizing taskrelevant semantic information to enhance diagnostic classification performance. Additionally, a probabilistic channel network is introduced to approximate molecular propagation dynamics, enabling gradient-based optimization for end-to-end learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic framework improves diagnostic accuracy by at least 25% compared to conventional JPEG compression with LDPC coding methods under resource-constrained communication scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted as an abstract paper for presentation at the 9th Workshop on Molecular Communications (MolCom), April 2025</p></details> |
| **[The study of non-complete-ring positron emission tomography (PET) detection method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00816v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a vital molecular imaging tool widely used in medical diagnosis and treatment evaluation. Traditional PET systems typically rely on complete detector rings to achieve full angular coverage for uniform and statistically robust sampling of coincidence events. However, incomplete-ring PET scanners have emerged in various scenarios due to hardware failures, cost constraints, or specific clinical needs. In such cases, conventional reconstruction algorithms often suffer from performance degradation due to reduced data completeness and geometric inconsistencies. This thesis proposes a coarse-to-fine reconstruction framework for incomplete-ring PET scanners. The framework first employs an Attention U-Net model to recover complete sinograms from incomplete ones, then uses the OSEM algorithm for preliminary reconstruction, and finally applies a two-stage architecture comprising a Coarse Prediction Module (CPM) and an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) for fine reconstruction. Our approach utilizes neighboring axial slices and spectral transform features as auxiliary guidance at the input level to ensure spatial and frequency domain consistency, and integrates a contrastive diffusion strategy at the output level to improve correspondence between low-quality PET inputs and refined PET outputs. Experimental results on public and in-house brain PET datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in metrics such as PSNR (35.6421 dB) and SSIM (0.9588), successfully preserving key anatomical structures and tracer distribution features, thus providing an effective solution for incomplete-ring PET imaging.</p></details> | 18 pages, 14 pages |

Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets and established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with respect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most comprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the honey bee (Apis mellifera), an ecologically vital pollinator. We evaluate ApisTox using a diverse suite of machine learning approaches, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as well as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical space. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as ApisTox, demonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art algorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for more diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the agrochemical domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolGround: A Benchmark for Molecular Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23668v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current molecular understanding approaches predominantly focus on the descriptive aspect of human perception, providing broad, topic-level insights. However, the referential aspect -- linking molecular concepts to specific structural components -- remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a molecular grounding benchmark designed to evaluate a model's referential abilities. We align molecular grounding with established conventions in NLP, cheminformatics, and molecular science, showcasing the potential of NLP techniques to advance molecular understanding within the AI for Science movement. Furthermore, we constructed the largest molecular understanding benchmark to date, comprising 79k QA pairs, and developed a multi-agent grounding prototype as proof of concept. This system outperforms existing models, including GPT-4o, and its grounding outputs have been integrated to enhance traditional tasks such as molecular captioning and ATC (Anatomical, Therapeutic, Chemical) classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[A predictive machine learning force field framework for liquid electrolyte development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07181v5)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force fields (MLFF) in solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to simulate liquid electrolyte, a critical component of the current commercial lithium-ion battery. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (\textbf{B}yteDance \textbf{A}I \textbf{M}olecular Simulation \textbf{Boo}ster), a predictive framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a demonstration of its capability in the context of liquid electrolyte for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum mechanical simulations. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble knowledge distillation approach and apply it to MLFFs to reduce the fluctuation of observations from MD simulations. Finally, we propose a density alignment algorithm to align BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. The current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average density error of 0.01 g/cm$^3$ on various compositions compared with experiment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Figur...</summary><p>Figures provided as the tex source files</p></details> |

As users navigate across the dual realities -- desktop and AR -- a way to move 3D objects between them is needed. We devise three baseline transition techniques based on common approaches in the literature and evaluate their usability and practicality in an initial user study (N=18). After refining both our transition techniques and the surrounding technical setup, we validate the applicability of the overall concept for real-world activities in an expert user study (N=6). In it, computational chemists followed their usual desktop workflows to build, manipulate, and analyze 3D molecular structures, but now aided with the addition of AR and our transition techniques. Based on our findings from both user studies, we provide lessons learned and takeaways for the design of 3D object transition techniques in desktop + AR environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ACM CHI 2025 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (Best Paper Award)</p></details> |

While recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of all-atom foundation models for molecular modeling and generation, existing approaches face challenges in generalization due to the multi-modal nature of atomic data and the lack of comprehensive analysis of training and sampling strategies. To address these limitations, we propose PharMolixFM, a unified framework for constructing all-atom foundation models based on multi-modal generative techniques. Our framework includes three variants using state-of-the-art multi-modal generative models. By formulating molecular tasks as a generalized denoising process with task-specific priors, PharMolixFM achieves robust performance across various structural biology applications. Experimental results demonstrate that PharMolixFM-Diff achieves competitive prediction accuracy in protein-small-molecule docking (83.9% vs. 90.2% RMSD < 2{\AA}, given pocket) with significantly improved inference speed. Moreover, we explore the empirical inference scaling law by introducing more sampling repeats or steps. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/PharMolix/OpenBioMed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00142v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel graph neural network (GNN) designed to operate in hyperbolic spaces, leveraging the Lorentzian model to enhance graph representation learning. Existing GNNs primarily operate in Euclidean spaces, which can limit their ability to capture hierarchical and multi-relational structures inherent to complex graphs. LGIN addresses this by incorporating curvature-aware aggregation functions that preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor, ensuring embeddings remain constrained within the hyperbolic space by proposing a new update rule that effectively captures both local neighborhood interactions and global structural properties, enabling LGIN to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs with expressiveness at least as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Through extensive evaluation across nine benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures, LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNNs, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy in modeling complex graph structures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to extend the concept of a powerful graph neural network to Riemannian manifolds, paving the way for future advancements in hyperbolic graph learning.

Inspired by this success, we extend the paradigm of training chemical language transformers on large-scale chemical datasets to generative tasks in this work. Specifically, we propose GP-MoLFormer, an autoregressive molecular string generator that is trained on more than 1.1B (billion) chemical SMILES. GP-MoLFormer uses a 46.8M parameter transformer decoder model with linear attention and rotary positional encodings as the base architecture. GP-MoLFormer's utility is evaluated and compared with that of existing baselines on three different tasks: de novo generation, scaffold-constrained molecular decoration, and unconstrained property-guided optimization. While the first two are handled with no additional training, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for the last task, which uses property-ordered molecular pairs as input. We call this new approach pair-tuning. Our results show GP-MoLFormer performs better or comparable with baselines across all three tasks, demonstrating its general utility for a variety of molecular generation tasks. We further report strong memorization of training data in GP-MoLFormer generations, which has so far remained unexplored for chemical language models. Our analyses reveal that training data memorization and novelty in generations are impacted by the quality and scale of the training data; duplication bias in training data can enhance memorization at the cost of lowering novelty. We further establish a scaling law relating inference compute and novelty in generations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional drug development--especially for small molecule therapeutics--is a highly complex, resource-intensive, and time-consuming process that requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the rise of large language models (LLMs), present a transformative opportunity to streamline and accelerate this process. In this paper, we introduce PharmAgents, a virtual pharmaceutical ecosystem driven by LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. PharmAgents simulates the full drug discovery workflow--from target discovery to preclinical evaluation--by integrating explainable, LLM-driven agents equipped with specialized machine learning models and computational tools. Through structured knowledge exchange and automated optimization, PharmAgents identifies potential therapeutic targets, discovers promising lead compounds, enhances binding affinity and key molecular properties, and performs in silico analyses of toxicity and synthetic feasibility. Additionally, the system supports interpretability, agent interaction, and self-evolvement, enabling it to refine future drug designs based on prior experience. By showcasing the potential of LLM-powered multi-agent systems in drug discovery, this work establishes a new paradigm for autonomous, explainable, and scalable pharmaceutical research, with future extensions toward comprehensive drug lifecycle management.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the conventional (e.g., Landau) models, the present operator takes an anisotropic form that accounts for a second energy transfer arising from the collective interactions between the pair of collision particles and the environment. Numerical results show that preserving the broadly overlooked anisotropic nature of the collision energy transfer is crucial for predicting the plasma kinetics with non-negligible correlations, where the Landau model shows limitations.</p></details> |  |

While classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are renowned for their scalability and robustness, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum circuit designs, limiting their applicability to a narrower range of graph-structured problems, falling short of real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by the classical GraphSAGE approach, utilizing quantum models as aggregators. In this work, we integrate established techniques for inductive representation learning on graphs with parametrized quantum convolutional and pooling layers, effectively bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer is flexible, enabling tailored designs for specific problems. Benchmarked on a node regression task with the QM9 dataset, we demonstrate that our framework successfully models a non-trivial molecular dataset, achieving performance comparable to classical GNNs. In particular, we show that our quantum approach exhibits robust generalization across molecules with varying numbers of atoms without requiring circuit modifications, slightly outperforming classical GNNs. Furthermore, we numerically investigate the scalability of the QGNN framework. Specifically, we demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus in our architecture as the number of qubits increases, suggesting that the proposed quantum model can be extended to handle larger and more complex graph-based problems effectively.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

While immunohistochemical staining (IHC) assists in distinguishing benign from malignant tissue, it involves increased work, higher costs, and diagnostic delays. Artificial intelligence (AI) presents a promising solution to reduce reliance on IHC by accurately classifying atypical glands and borderline morphologies in hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stained tissue sections. In this study, we evaluated an AI model's ability to minimize IHC use without compromising diagnostic accuracy by retrospectively analyzing prostate core needle biopsies from routine diagnostics at three different pathology sites. These cohorts were composed exclusively of difficult cases where the diagnosing pathologists required IHC to finalize the diagnosis. The AI model demonstrated area under the curve values of 0.951-0.993 for detecting cancer in routine H&E-stained slides. Applying sensitivity-prioritized diagnostic thresholds reduced the need for IHC staining by 44.4%, 42.0%, and 20.7% in the three cohorts investigated, without a single false negative prediction. This AI model shows potential for optimizing IHC use, streamlining decision-making in prostate pathology, and alleviating resource burdens.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 figures and 3 tables</p></details> |

Yet their computational cost often limits the timescales and system sizes that can be explored. Most data-driven efforts have been focused on reducing the computational cost of accurate interatomic forces required for solving the equations of motion. Despite their success, however, these machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are still bound to small time-steps. In this work, we introduce TrajCast, a transferable and data-efficient framework based on autoregressive equivariant message passing networks that directly updates atomic positions and velocities lifting the constraints imposed by traditional numerical integration. We benchmark our framework across various systems, including a small molecule, crystalline material, and bulk liquid, demonstrating excellent agreement with reference MD simulations for structural, dynamical, and energetic properties. Depending on the system, TrajCast allows for forecast intervals up to $30\times$ larger than traditional MD time-steps, generating over 15 ns of trajectory data per day for a solid with more than 4,000 atoms. By enabling efficient large-scale simulations over extended timescales, TrajCast can accelerate materials discovery and explore physical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional simulations and experiments. An open-source implementation of TrajCast is accessible under https://github.com/IBM/trajcast.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages total (19 manuscript, 6 SI). 5 figures in manuscript, 3 figures and 2 tables in SI</p></details> |
| **[Make Autoregressive Great Again: Diffusion-Free Graph Generation with Next-Scale Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23612v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models are popular generative models due to their speed and properties. However, they require an explicit sequence order, which contradicts the unordered nature of graphs. In contrast, diffusion models maintain permutation invariance and enable one-shot generation but require up to thousands of denoising steps and additional features, leading to high computational costs. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in image generation-especially the success of visual autoregressive methods-we propose MAG, a novel diffusion-free graph generation framework based on next-scale prediction. By leveraging a hierarchy of latent representations, the model progressively generates scales of the entire graph without the need for explicit node ordering. Extensive experiments on both generic and molecular graph datasets demonstrate that MAG delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to three orders of magnitude in speedup during inference.</p></details> | Draft #1 |

Recent deep learning models often suffer from high computational costs and limited generalization across datasets. In this study, we investigate a simpler yet effective approach using molecular representations such as Morgan fingerprints (MFPS), graph-based embeddings from graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and transformer-derived embeddings from MoLFormer integrated into a straightforward neural network. We benchmark our implementation on DrugBank DDI splits and a drug-drug affinity (DDA) dataset from the Food and Drug Administration. MFPS along with MoLFormer and GCN representations achieve competitive performance across tasks, even in the more challenging leak-proof split, highlighting the sufficiency of simple molecular representations. Moreover, we are able to identify key molecular motifs and structural patterns relevant to drug interactions via gradient-based analyses using the representations under study. Despite these results, dataset limitations such as insufficient chemical diversity, limited dataset size, and inconsistent labeling impact robust evaluation and challenge the need for more complex approaches. Our work provides a meaningful baseline and emphasizes the need for better dataset curation and progressive complexity scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the GEM Workshop at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, these data encompass diverse perturbations and readouts, and the complex dependence of experimental outcomes on their biological context makes it challenging to integrate insights across experiments. Here, we present the Large Perturbation Model (LPM), a deep-learning model that integrates multiple, heterogeneous perturbation experiments by representing perturbation, readout, and context as disentangled dimensions. LPM outperforms existing methods across multiple biological discovery tasks, including in predicting post-perturbation transcriptomes of unseen experiments, identifying shared molecular mechanisms of action between chemical and genetic perturbations, and facilitating the inference of gene-gene interaction networks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fast Direct: Query-Efficient Online Black-box Guidance for Diffusion-model Target Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01692v5)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guided diffusion-model generation is a promising direction for customizing the generation process of a pre-trained diffusion model to address specific downstream tasks. Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively.

To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces the Multi-Omics Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (MOGKAN), a deep learning model that integrates messenger RNA, micro RNA sequences, and DNA methylation data with Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks for accurate and interpretable cancer classification across 31 cancer types. MOGKAN employs a hybrid approach combining differential expression with DESeq2, Linear Models for Microarray (LIMMA), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to reduce multi-omics data dimensionality while preserving relevant biological features. The model architecture is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem principle, using trainable univariate functions to enhance interpretability and feature analysis. MOGKAN achieves classification accuracy of 96.28 percent and demonstrates low experimental variability with a standard deviation that is reduced by 1.58 to 7.30 percents compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The biomarkers identified by MOGKAN have been validated as cancer-related markers through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. The proposed model presents an ability to uncover molecular oncogenesis mechanisms by detecting phosphoinositide-binding substances and regulating sphingolipid cellular processes. By integrating multi-omics data with graph-based deep learning, our proposed approach demonstrates superior predictive performance and interpretability that has the potential to enhance the translation of complex multi-omics data into clinically actionable cancer diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, we explore the influence of the data partitioning and ensemble weighting strategies on the benefits of our method over the existing paradigm.

However, these progressions have also ushered in novel obstacles-specifically, the efficient annotation of extensive, long-tailed single-cell data pertaining to disease conditions. To effectively surmount this challenge, we introduce Celler, a state-of-the-art generative pre-training model crafted specifically for the annotation of single-cell data. Celler incorporates two groundbreaking elements: First, we introduced the Gaussian Inflation (GInf) Loss function. By dynamically adjusting sample weights, GInf Loss significantly enhances the model's ability to learn from rare categories while reducing the risk of overfitting for common categories. Secondly, we introduce an innovative Hard Data Mining (HDM) strategy into the training process, specifically targeting the challenging-to-learn minority data samples, which significantly improved the model's predictive accuracy. Additionally, to further advance research in this field, we have constructed a large-scale single-cell dataset: Celler-75, which encompasses 40 million cells distributed across 80 human tissues and 75 specific diseases. This dataset provides critical support for comprehensively exploring the potential of single-cell technology in disease research.

Researchers are exploring quantum computing to enhance the Transformer's design, though it still shows limited success with classical data. With a growing focus on leveraging quantum machine learning for quantum data, particularly in quantum chemistry, we propose the Molecular Quantum Transformer (MQT) for modeling interactions in molecular quantum systems. By utilizing quantum circuits to implement the attention mechanism on the molecular configurations, MQT can efficiently calculate ground-state energies for all configurations. Numerical demonstrations show that in calculating ground-state energies for H_2, LiH, BeH_2, and H_4, MQT outperforms the classical Transformer, highlighting the promise of quantum effects in Transformer structures. Furthermore, its pretraining capability on diverse molecular data facilitates the efficient learning of new molecules, extending its applicability to complex molecular systems with minimal additional effort.

Inspired by recent studies, which demonstrate that diffusion model, a prominent generative approach, can learn meaningful data representations that enhance predictive tasks, we explore the potential for developing a unified generative model in the molecular domain that effectively addresses both molecular generation and property prediction tasks. However, the integration of these tasks is challenging due to inherent inconsistencies, making simple multi-task learning ineffective. To address this, we propose UniGEM, the first unified model to successfully integrate molecular generation and property prediction, delivering superior performance in both tasks. Our key innovation lies in a novel two-phase generative process, where predictive tasks are activated in the later stages, after the molecular scaffold is formed. We further enhance task balance through innovative training strategies. Rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in both tasks. The principles behind UniGEM hold promise for broader applications, including natural language processing and computer vision.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Unified Latent Space for 3D Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15567v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[De Novo Molecular Design Enabled by Direct Preference Optimization and Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01389v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>De novo molecular design has extensive applications in drug discovery and materials science. The vast chemical space renders direct molecular searches computationally prohibitive, while traditional experimental screening is both time- and labor-intensive. Efficient molecular generation and screening methods are therefore essential for accelerating drug discovery and reducing costs. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to optimize molecular properties via reward mechanisms, its practical utility is limited by issues in training efficiency, convergence, and stability. To address these challenges, we adopt Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) from NLP, which uses molecular score-based sample pairs to maximize the likelihood difference between high- and low-quality molecules, effectively guiding the model toward better compounds. Moreover, integrating curriculum learning further boosts training efficiency and accelerates convergence. A systematic evaluation of the proposed method on the GuacaMol Benchmark yielded excellent scores. For instance, the method achieved a score of 0.883 on the Perindopril MPO task, representing a 6\% improvement over competing models. And subsequent target protein binding experiments confirmed its practical efficacy. These results demonstrate the strong potential of DPO for molecular design tasks and highlight its effectiveness as a robust and efficient solution for data-driven drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of all-atom foundation models for molecular modeling and generation, existing approaches face challenges in generalization due to the multi-modal nature of atomic data and the lack of comprehensive analysis of training and sampling strategies. To address these limitations, we propose PharMolixFM, a unified framework for constructing all-atom foundation models based on multi-modal generative techniques. Our framework includes three variants using state-of-the-art multi-modal generative models. By formulating molecular tasks as a generalized denoising process with task-specific priors, PharMolixFM achieves robust performance across various structural biology applications. Experimental results demonstrate that PharMolixFM-Diff achieves competitive prediction accuracy in protein-small-molecule docking (83.9% vs. 90.2% RMSD < 2{\AA}, given pocket) with significantly improved inference speed. Moreover, we explore the empirical inference scaling law by introducing more sampling repeats or steps. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/PharMolix/OpenBioMed.</p></details> |  |
| **[GP-MoLFormer: A Foundation Model For Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04912v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models trained on large and general purpose datasets consisting of molecular strings have recently emerged as a powerful tool for successfully modeling various structure-property relations. Inspired by this success, we extend the paradigm of training chemical language transformers on large-scale chemical datasets to generative tasks in this work. Specifically, we propose GP-MoLFormer, an autoregressive molecular string generator that is trained on more than 1.1B (billion) chemical SMILES. GP-MoLFormer uses a 46.8M parameter transformer decoder model with linear attention and rotary positional encodings as the base architecture. GP-MoLFormer's utility is evaluated and compared with that of existing baselines on three different tasks: de novo generation, scaffold-constrained molecular decoration, and unconstrained property-guided optimization. While the first two are handled with no additional training, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for the last task, which uses property-ordered molecular pairs as input. We call this new approach pair-tuning. Our results show GP-MoLFormer performs better or comparable with baselines across all three tasks, demonstrating its general utility for a variety of molecular generation tasks. We further report strong memorization of training data in GP-MoLFormer generations, which has so far remained unexplored for chemical language models. Our analyses reveal that training data memorization and novelty in generations are impacted by the quality and scale of the training data; duplication bias in training data can enhance memorization at the cost of lowering novelty. We further establish a scaling law relating inference compute and novelty in generations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Make Autoregressive Great Again: Diffusion-Free Graph Generation with Next-Scale Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23612v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models are popular generative models due to their speed and properties. However, they require an explicit sequence order, which contradicts the unordered nature of graphs. In contrast, diffusion models maintain permutation invariance and enable one-shot generation but require up to thousands of denoising steps and additional features, leading to high computational costs. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in image generation-especially the success of visual autoregressive methods-we propose MAG, a novel diffusion-free graph generation framework based on next-scale prediction. By leveraging a hierarchy of latent representations, the model progressively generates scales of the entire graph without the need for explicit node ordering. Extensive experiments on both generic and molecular graph datasets demonstrate that MAG delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to three orders of magnitude in speedup during inference.</p></details> | Draft #1 |
| **[Fast Direct: Query-Efficient Online Black-box Guidance for Diffusion-model Target Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01692v5)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guided diffusion-model generation is a promising direction for customizing the generation process of a pre-trained diffusion model to address specific downstream tasks. Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/kimyong95/guide-stable-diffusion/tree/fast-direct</p></details> |  |

However, existing SBDD methods often overlook two key challenges: (1) the multi-modal nature of this task and (2) the causal relationship between these modalities, limiting their plausibility and performance. To address both challenges, we propose TransDiffSBDD, an integrated framework combining autoregressive transformers and diffusion models for SBDD. Specifically, the autoregressive transformer models discrete molecular information, while the diffusion model samples continuous distributions, effectively resolving the first challenge. To address the second challenge, we design a hybrid-modal sequence for protein-ligand complexes that explicitly respects the causality between modalities. Experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark demonstrate that TransDiffSBDD outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Previous works in this framework often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on a subset of ZINC dataset, and by employing robust evaluation metrics we show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods for a wide range of drug design tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.09702</p></details> |

Existing generative methods are restricted to single-domain molecules, failing to address versatile therapeutic needs or utilize cross-domain transferability to enhance model performance. In this paper, we introduce Unified generative Modeling of 3D Molecules (UniMoMo), the first framework capable of designing binders of multiple molecular domains using a single model. In particular, UniMoMo unifies the representations of different molecules as graphs of blocks, where each block corresponds to either a standard amino acid or a molecular fragment. Based on these unified representations, UniMoMo utilizes a geometric latent diffusion model for 3D molecular generation, featuring an iterative full-atom autoencoder to compress blocks into latent space points, followed by an E(3)-equivariant diffusion process. Extensive benchmarks across peptides, antibodies, and small molecules demonstrate the superiority of our unified framework over existing domain-specific models, highlighting the benefits of multi-domain training.</p></details> | preprint |

While chemical Language Models (cLMs) have made strides in learning molecular properties, most fail to incorporate target-specific insights, restricting their ability to drive de-novo ligand generation. Chem42, a cutting-edge family of generative chemical Language Models, is designed to bridge this gap. By integrating atomic-level interactions with multimodal inputs from Prot42, a complementary protein Language Model, Chem42 achieves a sophisticated cross-modal representation of molecular structures, interactions, and binding patterns. This innovative framework enables the creation of structurally valid, synthetically accessible ligands with enhanced target specificity. Evaluations across diverse protein targets confirm that Chem42 surpasses existing approaches in chemical validity, target-aware design, and predicted binding affinity. By reducing the search space of viable drug candidates, Chem42 could accelerate the drug discovery pipeline, offering a powerful generative AI tool for precision medicine. Our Chem42 models set a new benchmark in molecule property prediction, conditional molecule generation, and target-aware ligand design. The models are publicly available at huggingface.co/inceptionai.</p></details> |  |
| **[Potential Score Matching: Debiasing Molecular Structure Sampling with Potential Energy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14569v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Despite their widespread occurrence, there remains a gap in modeling particle propagation through these complex structures from a molecular communication (MC) perspective. This paper introduces a generalized analytical framework for modeling diffusion-based molecular communication in multi-layered spherical environments. The framework is capable of supporting an arbitrary number of layers and flexible transmitter-receiver positioning. As an example, the detailed formulation is presented for the three-layer sphere, which is particularly relevant for different biological models such as tumor spheroids. The analytical results are validated using particle-based simulation (PBS) in scenarios that have short inter-layer distances. The findings reveal that the characteristics of each layer significantly impact molecule propagation throughout the entire structure, making their consideration crucial for designing targeted therapies and optimizing drug delivery systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; accepted to be presented in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Communication</p></details> |
| **[A Reinforcement Learning-Driven Transformer GAN for Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12796v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating molecules with desired chemical properties presents a critical challenge in fields such as chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have significantly contributed to data-driven molecular generation. However, challenges persist due to the inherent sensitivity of simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) representations and the difficulties in applying generative adversarial networks (GANs) to discrete data. This study introduces RL-MolGAN, a novel Transformer-based discrete GAN framework designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional Transformer architectures, RL-MolGAN utilizes a first-decoder-then-encoder structure, facilitating the generation of drug-like molecules from both $de~novo$ and scaffold-based designs. In addition, RL-MolGAN integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) techniques to enhance the stability of GAN training and optimize the chemical properties of the generated molecules. To further improve the model's performance, RL-MolWGAN, an extension of RL-MolGAN, incorporates Wasserstein distance and mini-batch discrimination, which together enhance the stability of the GAN. Experimental results on two widely used molecular datasets, QM9 and ZINC, validate the effectiveness of our models in generating high-quality molecular structures with diverse and desirable chemical properties.</p></details> |  |

Designed to support AI-driven drug design and discovery, M$^{3}$-20M is 71 times more in the number of molecules than the largest existing dataset, providing an unprecedented scale that can highly benefit the training or fine-tuning of models, including large language models for drug design and discovery tasks. This dataset integrates one-dimensional SMILES, two-dimensional molecular graphs, three-dimensional molecular structures, physicochemical properties, and textual descriptions collected through web crawling and generated using GPT-3.5, offering a comprehensive view of each molecule. To demonstrate the power of M$^{3}$-20M in drug design and discovery, we conduct extensive experiments on two key tasks: molecule generation and molecular property prediction, using large language models including GLM4, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama3-8b. Our experimental results show that M$^{3}$-20M can significantly boost model performance in both tasks. Specifically, it enables the models to generate more diverse and valid molecular structures and achieve higher property prediction accuracy than existing single-modal datasets, which validates the value and potential of M$^{3}$-20M in supporting AI-driven drug design and discovery.

| **[Probabilistic Graph Circuits: Deep Generative Models for Tractable Probabilistic Inference over Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12162v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models (DGMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in capturing complex probability distributions over graphs. Although their excellent performance is attributed to powerful and scalable deep neural networks, it is, at the same time, exactly the presence of these highly non-linear transformations that makes DGMs intractable. Indeed, despite representing probability distributions, intractable DGMs deny probabilistic foundations by their inability to answer even the most basic inference queries without approximations or design choices specific to a very narrow range of queries. To address this limitation, we propose probabilistic graph circuits (PGCs), a framework of tractable DGMs that provide exact and efficient probabilistic inference over (arbitrary parts of) graphs. Nonetheless, achieving both exactness and efficiency is challenging in the permutation-invariant setting of graphs. We design PGCs that are inherently invariant and satisfy these two requirements, yet at the cost of low expressive power. Therefore, we investigate two alternative strategies to achieve the invariance: the first sacrifices the efficiency, and the second sacrifices the exactness. We demonstrate that ignoring the permutation invariance can have severe consequences in anomaly detection, and that the latter approach is competitive with, and sometimes better than, existing intractable DGMs in the context of molecular graph generation.</p></details> |  |

While these pesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning applications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or regression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular structures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Pesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders, designed to create pesticide candidates with optimized properties for the first time. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an initial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure representation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates toxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple toxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity to generate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Notably, Pesti-Gen achieves approximately 68\% structural validity in generating new molecular structures, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in producing optimized and feasible pesticide candidates, thereby providing a new way for safer and more sustainable pest management solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the RECOMB 2025 Poster Track</p></details> |

This success is largely attributed to the effectiveness of molecular tokenization strategies. In protein science, the amino acid sequence serves as the sole tokenizer for LLMs. However, many fundamental challenges in protein science are inherently structure-dependent. The absence of structure-aware tokens significantly limits the capabilities of LLMs for comprehensive biomolecular comprehension and multimodal generation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, ProtTeX, which tokenizes the protein sequences, structures, and textual information into a unified discrete space. This innovative approach enables joint training of the LLM exclusively through the Next-Token Prediction paradigm, facilitating multimodal protein reasoning and generation. ProtTeX enables general LLMs to perceive and process protein structures through sequential text input, leverage structural information as intermediate reasoning components, and generate or manipulate structures via sequential text output. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in protein function prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art domain expert model with a twofold increase in accuracy. Our framework enables high-quality conformational generation and customizable protein design. For the first time, we demonstrate that by adopting the standard training and inference pipelines from the LLM domain, ProtTeX empowers decoder-only LLMs to effectively address diverse spectrum of protein-related tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Chemistry-Inspired Diffusion with Non-Differentiable Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06502v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in the conditional generation of novel molecules. These models can be guided in two ways: (i) explicitly, through additional features representing the condition, or (ii) implicitly, using a property predictor. However, training property predictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled data and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a novel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled datasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a non-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of relying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form of estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a conditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this results in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular structures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly reduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used for stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit guidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular properties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular optimization tasks beyond stability optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing molecular generation methods present significant limitations: those operating at the atomic level often lack synthetic feasibility, drug-likeness, and interpretability, while fragment-based approaches frequently overlook comprehensive factors that influence protein-molecule interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel fragment-based molecular generation framework tailored for specific proteins. Our method begins by constructing a protein subpocket and molecular arm concept-based neural network, which systematically integrates interaction force information and geometric complementarity to sample molecular arms for specific protein subpockets. Subsequently, we introduce a diffusion model to generate molecular backbones that connect these arms, ensuring structural integrity and chemical diversity. Our approach significantly improves synthetic feasibility and binding affinity, with a 4% increase in drug-likeness and a 6% improvement in synthetic feasibility. Furthermore, by integrating explicit interaction data through a concept-based model, our framework enhances interpretability, offering valuable insights into the molecular design process.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Graph2Token, an efficient solution that aligns graph tokens to LLM tokens. The key idea is to represent a graph token with the LLM token vocabulary, without fine-tuning the LLM backbone. To achieve this goal, we first construct a molecule-text paired dataset from multisources, including CHEBI and HMDB, to train a graph structure encoder, which reduces the distance between graphs and texts representations in the feature space. Then, we propose a novel alignment strategy that associates a graph token with LLM tokens. To further unleash the potential of LLMs, we collect molecular IUPAC name identifiers, which are incorporated into the LLM prompts. By aligning molecular graphs as special tokens, we can activate LLM generalization ability to molecular few-shot learning. Extensive experiments on molecular classification and regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Graph2Token.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 camera ready version</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of manual annotation for biochemical properties, the performance for molecule generation tasks is still limited, especially for tasks involving multi-properties constraints. In this work, we present a two-step framework PEIT (Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning) to improve LLMs for molecular-related tasks. In the first step, we use textual descriptions, SMILES, and biochemical properties as multimodal inputs to pre-train a model called PEIT-GEN, by aligning multi-modal representations to synthesize instruction data. In the second step, we fine-tune existing open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the resulting PEIT-LLM can handle molecule captioning, text-based molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and our newly proposed multi-constraint molecule generation tasks. Experimental results show that our pre-trained PEIT-GEN outperforms MolT5 and BioT5 in molecule captioning, demonstrating modalities align well between textual descriptions, structures, and biochemical properties. Furthermore, PEIT-LLM shows promising improvements in multi-task molecule generation, proving the scalability of the PEIT framework for various molecular tasks.

While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an \emph{order-policy}, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the exact log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation. On the challenging domain of molecular graph generation, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k benchmarks, evaluated using the Fr\'{e}chet ChemNet Distance (FCD).</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a Python-based algorithm that automates the generation of reaction templates for the LAMMPS REACTION package, leveraging graph-theoretical principles and sub-graph isomorphism techniques. By representing molecular systems as mathematical graphs, the method enables automated identification of conserved molecular domains, reaction sites, and atom mappings, significantly reducing manual effort. The algorithm was validated on three case studies: poly-addition, poly-condensation, and chain polymerization, demonstrating its ability to map conserved regions, identify reaction-initiating atoms, and resolve challenges such as symmetric reactants and indistinguishable atoms. Additionally, the generated templates were optimized for computational efficiency by retaining only essential reactive domains, ensuring scalability and consistency in high-throughput workflows for computational chemistry, materials science, and machine learning applications. Future work will focus on extending the method to mixed organic-inorganic systems, incorporating adaptive scoring mechanisms, and integrating quantum mechanical calculations to enhance its applicability.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

| **[P2DFlow: A Protein Ensemble Generative Model with SE(3) Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17196v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological processes, functions, and properties are intricately linked to the ensemble of protein conformations, rather than being solely determined by a single stable conformation. In this study, we have developed P2DFlow, a generative model based on SE(3) flow matching, to predict the structural ensembles of proteins. We specifically designed a valuable prior for the flow process and enhanced the model's ability to distinguish each intermediate state by incorporating an additional dimension to describe the ensemble data, which can reflect the physical laws governing the distribution of ensembles, so that the prior knowledge can effectively guide the generation process.

| **[Dynamic Search for Inference-Time Alignment in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02039v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown promising generative capabilities across diverse domains, yet aligning their outputs with desired reward functions remains a challenge, particularly in cases where reward functions are non-differentiable. Some gradient-free guidance methods have been developed, but they often struggle to achieve optimal inference-time alignment. In this work, we newly frame inference-time alignment in diffusion as a search problem and propose Dynamic Search for Diffusion (DSearch), which subsamples from denoising processes and approximates intermediate node rewards. It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in atom- and motif-wise deep learning models for 3D molecular generation, current methods often struggle with validity and reliability. To address these issues, we develop the Atom-Motif Consistency Diffusion Model (AMDiff), utilizing a joint-training paradigm for multi-view learning. This model features a hierarchical diffusion architecture that integrates both atom- and motif-level views of molecules, allowing for comprehensive exploration of complementary information. By leveraging classifier-free guidance and incorporating binding site features as conditional inputs, AMDiff ensures robust molecule generation across diverse targets. Compared to existing approaches, AMDiff exhibits superior validity and novelty in generating molecules tailored to fit various protein pockets. Case studies targeting protein kinases, including Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) and Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), demonstrate the model's capability in structure-based de novo drug design. Overall, AMDiff bridges the gap between atom-view and motif-view drug discovery and speeds up the process of target-aware molecular generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

SymDiff resembles a learned data augmentation that is deployed at sampling time, and is lightweight, computationally efficient, and easy to implement on top of arbitrary off-the-shelf models. In contrast to previous work, SymDiff typically does not require any neural network components that are intrinsically equivariant, avoiding the need for complex parameterisations or the use of higher-order geometric features. Instead, our method can leverage highly scalable modern architectures as drop-in replacements for these more constrained alternatives. We show that this additional flexibility yields significant empirical benefit for $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariant molecular generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of symmetrisation to generative modelling, suggesting its potential in this domain more generally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods fall into PC-Free and PC-Aware categories based on their use of 3D point clouds (PC). PC-Free models prioritize diversity but suffer from lower validity due to overlooking PC constraints, while PC-Aware models ensure higher validity but restrict diversity by enforcing strict PC constraints. To overcome these trade-offs without additional training, we propose HybridLinker, a framework that enhances PC-Aware inference by providing diverse bonding topologies from a pretrained PC-Free model as guidance. At its core, we propose LinkerDPS, the first diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) method operating across PC-Free and PC-Aware spaces, bridging molecular topology with 3D point clouds via an energy-inspired function. By transferring the diverse sampling distribution of PC-Free models into the PC-Aware distribution, HybridLinker significantly and consistently surpasses baselines, improving both validity and diversity in foundational molecular design and applied property optimization tasks, establishing a new DPS framework in the molecular and graph domains beyond imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Auto-encoding Molecules: Graph-Matching Capabilities Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00426v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoencoders are effective deep learning models that can function as generative models and learn latent representations for downstream tasks. The use of graph autoencoders - with both encoder and decoder implemented as message passing networks - is intriguing due to their ability to generate permutation-invariant graph representations. However, this approach faces difficulties because decoding a graph structure from a single vector is challenging, and comparing input and output graphs requires an effective permutation-invariant similarity measure. As a result, many studies rely on approximate methods. In this work, we explore the effect of graph matching precision on the training behavior and generation capabilities of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we propose a transformer-based message passing graph decoder as an alternative to a graph neural network decoder, that is more robust and expressive by leveraging global attention mechanisms. (2) We show that the precision of graph matching has significant impact on training behavior and is essential for effective de novo (molecular) graph generation.

Current approaches, however, often suffer from very slow sampling times or generate molecules with poor chemical validity. Addressing these limitations, we propose Semla, a scalable E(3)-equivariant message passing architecture. We further introduce an unconditional 3D molecular generation model, SemlaFlow, which is trained using equivariant flow matching to generate a joint distribution over atom types, coordinates, bond types and formal charges. Our model produces state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with as few as 20 sampling steps, corresponding to a two order-of-magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight limitations of current evaluation methods for 3D generation and propose new benchmark metrics for unconditional molecular generators. Finally, using these new metrics, we compare our model's ability to generate high quality samples against current approaches and further demonstrate SemlaFlow's strong performance.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |

Language models and graph-based models are extensively utilized within this domain, consistently achieving state-of-the-art results across an array of tasks. However, the prevailing practice of representing chemical compounds in the SMILES format -- used by most datasets and many language models -- presents notable limitations as a training data format. In contrast, chemical fingerprints offer a more physically informed representation of compounds, thereby enhancing their suitability for model training. This study aims to develop a language model that is specifically trained on fingerprints. Furthermore, we introduce a bimodal architecture that integrates this language model with a graph model. Our proposed methodology synthesizes these approaches, utilizing RoBERTa as the language model and employing Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graphormer as graph models. This integration results in a significant improvement in predictive performance compared to conventional strategies for tasks such as Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) and the prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, among others.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, retrieval-augmented generation has become a principled approach commonly used with language models. However, the optimal integration of retrieval augmentation into molecular machine learning remains unclear. Graph neural networks stand to benefit from clever matching to understand the structural alignment of retrieved molecules to a query molecule. Neural graph matching offers a compelling solution by explicitly modeling node and edge affinities between two structural graphs while employing a noise-robust, end-to-end neural network to learn affinity metrics. We apply this approach to mass spectrum simulation and introduce MARASON, a novel model that incorporates neural graph matching to enhance a fragmentation-based neural network. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our design, with MARASON achieving 28% top-1 accuracy, a substantial improvement over the non-retrieval state-of-the-art accuracy of 19%. Moreover, MARASON outperforms both naive retrieval-augmented generation methods and traditional graph matching approaches.</p></details> |  |

The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.</p></details> |  |

Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in interpreting molecular structures, their instruction datasets are limited to the specific knowledge from task-oriented datasets and do not fully cover the fundamental characteristics of molecules, hindering their abilities as general-purpose molecular assistants. To address this issue, we propose Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules via multi-modal instruction tuning. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental features of molecules, incorporating essential knowledge from molecular structures. In addition, to improve understanding of molecular features, we introduce a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of different molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and generating relevant responses to users' queries with detailed explanations, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.

Traditional generative models often struggle with limited training data, particularly in drug discovery, where molecular datasets for specific therapeutic targets, such as nucleic acids binders and central nervous system (CNS) drugs, are scarce. ADSeqGAN addresses this challenge by integrating an auxiliary random forest classifier as an additional discriminator into the GAN framework, significantly improves molecular generation quality and class specificity. Our method incorporates pretrained generator and Wasserstein distance to enhance training stability and diversity. We evaluate ADSeqGAN on a dataset comprising nucleic acid-targeting and protein-targeting small molecules, demonstrating its superior ability to generate nucleic acid binders compared to baseline models such as SeqGAN, ORGAN, and MolGPT. Through an oversampling strategy, ADSeqGAN also significantly improves CNS drug generation, achieving a higher yield than traditional de novo models. Critical assessments, including docking simulations and molecular property analysis, confirm that ADSeqGAN-generated molecules exhibit strong binding affinities, enhanced chemical diversity, and improved synthetic feasibility. Overall, ADSeqGAN presents a novel framework for generative molecular design in data-scarce scenarios, offering potential applications in computational drug discovery. We have demonstrated the successful applications of ADSeqGAN in generating synthetic nucleic acid-targeting and CNS drugs in this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating $π$-Functional Molecules Using STGG+ with Active Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14842v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating novel molecules with out-of-distribution properties is a major challenge in molecular discovery. While supervised learning methods generate high-quality molecules similar to those in a dataset, they struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution properties. Reinforcement learning can explore new chemical spaces but often conducts 'reward-hacking' and generates non-synthesizable molecules. In this work, we address this problem by integrating a state-of-the-art supervised learning method, STGG+, in an active learning loop. Our approach iteratively generates, evaluates, and fine-tunes STGG+ to continuously expand its knowledge. We denote this approach STGG+AL. We apply STGG+AL to the design of organic $\pi$-functional materials, specifically two challenging tasks: 1) generating highly absorptive molecules characterized by high oscillator strength and 2) designing absorptive molecules with reasonable oscillator strength in the near-infrared (NIR) range. The generated molecules are validated and rationalized in-silico with time-dependent density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that our method is highly effective in generating novel molecules with high oscillator strength, contrary to existing methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We open-source our active-learning code along with our Conjugated-xTB dataset containing 2.9 million $\pi$-conjugated molecules and the function for approximating the oscillator strength and absorption wavelength (based on sTDA-xTB).</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/STGG-AL</p></details> |

Notably, FragFM achieves over 99\% validity with significantly fewer sampling steps, improving scalability while preserving molecular diversity.

Existing methods primarily focus on single-scale features, overlooking the hierarchical molecular structures that determine different molecular properties. To address these issues, we introduce Universal Matching Networks (UniMatch), a dual matching framework that integrates explicit hierarchical molecular matching with implicit task-level matching via meta-learning, bridging multi-level molecular representations and task-level generalization. Specifically, our approach explicitly captures structural features across multiple levels, such as atoms, substructures, and molecules, via hierarchical pooling and matching, facilitating precise molecular representation and comparison. Additionally, we employ a meta-learning strategy for implicit task-level matching, allowing the model to capture shared patterns across tasks and quickly adapt to new ones. This unified matching framework ensures effective molecular alignment while leveraging shared meta-knowledge for fast adaptation. Our experimental results demonstrate that UniMatch outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the MoleculeNet and FS-Mol benchmarks, achieving improvements of 2.87% in AUROC and 6.52% in delta AUPRC. UniMatch also shows excellent generalization ability on the Meta-MolNet benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as ICLR 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Diverse Molecules? Towards Alignment with Structural Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03138v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in molecular generation, which offers potential to accelerate drug discovery. However, the current LLMs overlook a critical requirement for drug discovery: proposing a diverse set of molecules. This diversity is essential for improving the chances of finding a viable drug, as it provides alternative molecules that may succeed where others fail in real-world validations. Nevertheless, the LLMs often output structurally similar molecules. While decoding schemes like diverse beam search may enhance textual diversity, this often does not align with molecular structural diversity. In response, we propose a new method for fine-tuning molecular generative LLMs to autoregressively generate a set of structurally diverse molecules, where each molecule is generated by conditioning on the previously generated molecules. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) supervised fine-tuning to adapt LLMs to autoregressively generate molecules in a sequence and (2) reinforcement learning to maximize structural diversity within the generated molecules. Our experiments show that the proposed approach enables LLMs to generate diverse molecules better than existing approaches for diverse sequence generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MING: A Functional Approach to Learning Molecular Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12522v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional molecule generation methods often rely on sequence- or graph-based representations, which can limit their expressive power or require complex permutation-equivariant architectures. This paper introduces a novel paradigm for learning molecule generative models based on functional representations. Specifically, we propose Molecular Implicit Neural Generation (MING), a diffusion-based model that learns molecular distributions in the function space. Unlike standard diffusion processes in the data space, MING employs a novel functional denoising probabilistic process, which jointly denoises information in both the function's input and output spaces by leveraging an expectation-maximization procedure for latent implicit neural representations of data. This approach enables a simple yet effective model design that accurately captures underlying function distributions. Experimental results on molecule-related datasets demonstrate MING's superior performance and ability to generate plausible molecular samples, surpassing state-of-the-art data-space methods while offering a more streamlined architecture and significantly faster generation times.

| **[Conformal Generative Modeling with Improved Sample Efficiency through Sequential Greedy Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01660v2)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models lack rigorous statistical guarantees for their outputs and are therefore unreliable in safety-critical applications. In this work, we propose Sequential Conformal Prediction for Generative Models (SCOPE-Gen), a sequential conformal prediction method producing prediction sets that satisfy a rigorous statistical guarantee called conformal admissibility control. This guarantee states that with high probability, the prediction sets contain at least one admissible (or valid) example. To this end, our method first samples an initial set of i.i.d. examples from a black box generative model. Then, this set is iteratively pruned via so-called greedy filters. As a consequence of the iterative generation procedure, admissibility of the final prediction set factorizes as a Markov chain. This factorization is crucial, because it allows to control each factor separately, using conformal prediction. In comparison to prior work, our method demonstrates a large reduction in the number of admissibility evaluations during calibration. This reduction is important in safety-critical applications, where these evaluations must be conducted manually by domain experts and are therefore costly and time consuming. We highlight the advantages of our method in terms of admissibility evaluations and cardinality of the prediction sets through experiments in natural language generation and molecular graph extension tasks.</p></details> |  |

Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the leading technique for high-throughput elucidation of molecular structures. However, decoding a molecular structure from its mass spectrum is exceptionally challenging, even when performed by human experts. As a result, the vast majority of acquired MS/MS spectra remain uninterpreted, thereby limiting our understanding of the underlying (bio)chemical processes. Despite decades of progress in machine learning applications for predicting molecular structures from MS/MS spectra, the development of new methods is severely hindered by the lack of standard datasets and evaluation protocols. To address this problem, we propose MassSpecGym -- the first comprehensive benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules from MS/MS data. Our benchmark comprises the largest publicly available collection of high-quality labeled MS/MS spectra and defines three MS/MS annotation challenges: de novo molecular structure generation, molecule retrieval, and spectrum simulation. It includes new evaluation metrics and a generalization-demanding data split, therefore standardizing the MS/MS annotation tasks and rendering the problem accessible to the broad machine learning community.

Equivariant denoisers are commonly used to address this, but they introduce architectural complexity and optimization challenges, including noisy gradients and convergence issues. We propose a novel approach that enforces equivariance through a symmetrized loss function, which applies a time-dependent weighted averaging operation over group actions to the model's prediction target. This ensures equivariance without explicit architectural constraints and reduces gradient variance, leading to more stable and efficient optimization. Our method uses Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the average, incurring minimal computational overhead. We provide theoretical guarantees of equivariance for the minimizer of our loss function and demonstrate its effectiveness on synthetic datasets and the molecular conformation generation task using the GEOM-QM9 dataset. Experiments show improved sample quality compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of our approach to enhance the scalability and practicality of equivariant diffusion models in generative tasks.</p></details> |  |

One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional $\textit{de novo}$ generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on $\textit{de novo}$ molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size. DiffMS code is publicly available at https://github.com/coleygroup/DiffMS.</p></details> | Preprint |

In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as an impressive class of deep generative models, sparking extensive research and leading to numerous studies on their application to molecular generative tasks. Despite the proliferation of related work, there remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this area. Particularly, due to the diversity of diffusion model formulations, molecular data modalities, and generative task types, the research landscape is challenging to navigate, hindering understanding and limiting the area's growth. To address this, this paper conducts a comprehensive survey of diffusion model-based molecular generative methods. We systematically review the research from the perspectives of methodological formulations, data modalities, and task types, offering a novel taxonomy.

| **[Enhancing Diffusion Models Efficiency by Disentangling Total-Variance and Signal-to-Noise Ratio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08598v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long sampling time of diffusion models remains a significant bottleneck, which can be mitigated by reducing the number of diffusion time steps. However, the quality of samples with fewer steps is highly dependent on the noise schedule, i.e., the specific manner in which noise is introduced and the signal is reduced at each step. Although prior work has improved upon the original variance-preserving and variance-exploding schedules, these approaches $\textit{passively}$ adjust the total variance, without direct control over it. In this work, we propose a novel total-variance/signal-to-noise-ratio disentangled (TV/SNR) framework, where TV and SNR can be controlled independently. Our approach reveals that different existing schedules, where the TV explodes exponentially, can be $\textit{improved}$ by setting a constant TV schedule while preserving the same SNR schedule. Furthermore, generalizing the SNR schedule of the optimal transport flow matching significantly improves the performance in molecular structure generation, achieving few step generation of stable molecules. A similar tendency is observed in image generation, where our approach with a uniform diffusion time grid performs comparably to the highly tailored EDM sampler.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Representation Condition Improves Equivariant Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03655v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in molecular generative models have demonstrated substantial potential in accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often face challenges in generating high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to enhance the performance of molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the molecule generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared to directly generating a molecule, the relatively easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second-stage generation to reach a high-quality molecule in a more goal-oriented and much faster way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as the base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation tasks on the widely-used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 31\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations over conditioning on individual property values as in previous approaches. Furthermore, we show that, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly accelerating the generation process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation of Molecules via Algebraic Data Types : Advancing Beyond SMILES & SELFIES](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13633v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel molecular representation through Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) - composite data structures formed through the combination of simpler types that obey algebraic laws. By explicitly considering how the datatype of a representation constrains the operations which may be performed, we ensure meaningful inference can be performed over generative models (programs with sample} and score operations). This stands in contrast to string-based representations where string-type operations may only indirectly correspond to chemical and physical molecular properties, and at worst produce nonsensical output. The ADT presented implements the Dietz representation for molecular constitution via multigraphs and bonding systems, and uses atomic coordinate data to represent 3D information and stereochemical features. This creates a general digital molecular representation which surpasses the limitations of the string-based representations and the 2D-graph based models on which they are based. In addition, we present novel support for quantum information through representation of shells, subshells, and orbitals, greatly expanding the representational scope beyond current approaches, for instance in Molecular Orbital theory. The framework's capabilities are demonstrated through key applications: Bayesian probabilistic programming is demonstrated through integration with LazyPPL, a lazy probabilistic programming library; molecules are made instances of a group under rotation, necessary for geometric learning techniques which exploit the invariance of molecular properties under different representations; and the framework's flexibility is demonstrated through an extension to model chemical reactions. After critiquing previous representations, we provide an open-source solution in Haskell - a type-safe, purely functional programming language.</p></details> | 1 Figure |
| **[Representational Alignment with Chemical Induced Fit for Molecular Relational Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07027v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) is widely applied in natural sciences to predict relationships between molecular pairs by extracting structural features. The representational similarity between substructure pairs determines the functional compatibility of molecular binding sites. Nevertheless, aligning substructure representations by attention mechanisms lacks guidance from chemical knowledge, resulting in unstable model performance in chemical space (\textit{e.g.}, functional group, scaffold) shifted data. With theoretical justification, we propose the \textbf{Re}presentational \textbf{Align}ment with Chemical Induced \textbf{Fit} (ReAlignFit) to enhance the stability of MRL. ReAlignFit dynamically aligns substructure representation in MRL by introducing chemical Induced Fit-based inductive bias. In the induction process, we design the Bias Correction Function based on substructure edge reconstruction to align representations between substructure pairs by simulating chemical conformational changes (dynamic combination of substructures). ReAlignFit further integrates the Subgraph Information Bottleneck during fit process to refine and optimize substructure pairs exhibiting high chemical functional compatibility, leveraging them to generate molecular embeddings. Experimental results on nine datasets demonstrate that ReAlignFit outperforms state-of-the-art models in two tasks and significantly enhances model's stability in both rule-shifted and scaffold-shifted data distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOG-Diff: Higher-Order Guided Diffusion for Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04308v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph generation is a critical yet challenging task as empirical analyses require a deep understanding of complex, non-Euclidean structures. Although diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, these models typically adapt from the frameworks designed for image generation, making them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose a novel Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff) model that follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum and is guided by higher-order information, enabling the progressive generation of plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiminghh/HOG-Diff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mol-LLM: Generalist Molecular LLM with Improved Graph Utilization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02810v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have motivated the development of general LLMs for molecular tasks. While several studies have demonstrated that fine-tuned LLMs can achieve impressive benchmark performances, they are far from genuine generalist molecular LLMs due to a lack of fundamental understanding of molecular structure. Specifically, when given molecular task instructions, LLMs trained with naive next-token prediction training assign similar likelihood scores to both original and negatively corrupted molecules, revealing their lack of molecular structure understanding that is crucial for reliable and general molecular LLMs. To overcome this limitation and obtain a true generalist molecular LLM, we introduce a novel multi-modal training method based on a thorough multi-modal instruction tuning as well as a molecular structure preference optimization between chosen and rejected graphs. On various molecular benchmarks, the proposed generalist molecular LLM, called Mol-LLM, achieves state-of-the-art performances among generalist LLMs on most tasks, at the same time, surpassing or comparable to state-of-the-art specialist LLMs. Moreover, Mol-LLM also shows superior generalization performances in reaction prediction tasks, demonstrating the effect of the molecular structure understanding for generalization perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling on Lie Groups via Euclidean Generalized Score Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02513v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We extend Euclidean score-based diffusion processes to generative modeling on Lie groups. Through the formalism of Generalized Score Matching, our approach yields a Langevin dynamics which decomposes as a direct sum of Lie algebra representations, enabling generative processes on Lie groups while operating in Euclidean space. Unlike equivariant models, which restrict the space of learnable functions by quotienting out group orbits, our method can model any target distribution on any (non-Abelian) Lie group. Standard score matching emerges as a special case of our framework when the Lie group is the translation group. We prove that our generalized generative processes arise as solutions to a new class of paired stochastic differential equations (SDEs), introduced here for the first time. We validate our approach through experiments on diverse data types, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications such as SO(3)-guided molecular conformer generation and modeling ligand-specific global SE(3) transformations for molecular docking, showing improvement in comparison to Riemannian diffusion on the group itself. We show that an appropriate choice of Lie group enhances learning efficiency by reducing the effective dimensionality of the trajectory space and enables the modeling of transitions between complex data distributions. Additionally, we demonstrate the universality of our approach by deriving how it extends to flow matching.</p></details> | 27 pages |
| **[Flatten Graphs as Sequences: Transformers are Scalable Graph Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02216v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AutoGraph, a novel autoregressive framework for generating large attributed graphs using decoder-only transformers. At the core of our approach is a reversible "flattening" process that transforms graphs into random sequences. By sampling and learning from these sequences, AutoGraph enables transformers to model and generate complex graph structures in a manner akin to natural language. In contrast to diffusion models that rely on computationally intensive node features, our approach operates exclusively on these sequences. The sampling complexity and sequence length scale linearly with the number of edges, making AutoGraph highly scalable for generating large sparse graphs. Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse synthetic and molecular graph generation benchmarks, while delivering a 100-fold generation and a 3-fold training speedup compared to leading diffusion models. Additionally, it demonstrates promising transfer capabilities and supports substructure-conditioned generation without additional fine-tuning. By extending language modeling techniques to graph generation, this work paves the way for developing graph foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Docking-Aware Attention: Dynamic Protein Representations through Molecular Context Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01461v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational prediction of enzymatic reactions represents a crucial challenge in sustainable chemical synthesis across various scientific domains, ranging from drug discovery to materials science and green chemistry. These syntheses rely on proteins that selectively catalyze complex molecular transformations. These protein catalysts exhibit remarkable substrate adaptability, with the same protein often catalyzing different chemical transformations depending on its molecular partners. Current approaches to protein representation in reaction prediction either ignore protein structure entirely or rely on static embeddings, failing to capture how proteins dynamically adapt their behavior to different substrates. We present Docking-Aware Attention (DAA), a novel architecture that generates dynamic, context-dependent protein representations by incorporating molecular docking information into the attention mechanism. DAA combines physical interaction scores from docking predictions with learned attention patterns to focus on protein regions most relevant to specific molecular interactions. We evaluate our method on enzymatic reaction prediction, where it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 62.2\% accuracy versus 56.79\% on complex molecules and 55.54\% versus 49.45\% on innovative reactions. Through detailed ablation studies and visualizations, we demonstrate how DAA generates interpretable attention patterns that adapt to different molecular contexts. Our approach represents a general framework for context-aware protein representation in biocatalysis prediction, with potential applications across enzymatic synthesis planning. We open-source our implementation and pre-trained models to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable Boltzmann Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14426v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of equilibrium samples of molecular systems has been a long-standing problem in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators are a generative machine learning method that addresses this issue by learning a transformation via a normalizing flow from a simple prior distribution to the target Boltzmann distribution of interest. Recently, flow matching has been employed to train Boltzmann Generators for small molecular systems in Cartesian coordinates. We extend this work and propose a first framework for Boltzmann Generators that are transferable across chemical space, such that they predict zero-shot Boltzmann distributions for test molecules without being retrained for these systems. These transferable Boltzmann Generators allow approximate sampling from the target distribution of unseen systems, as well as efficient reweighting to the target Boltzmann distribution. The transferability of the proposed framework is evaluated on dipeptides, where we show that it generalizes efficiently to unseen systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed architecture enhances the efficiency of Boltzmann Generators trained on single molecular systems.</p></details> |  |

Here we introduce the QMe14S dataset, comprising 186,102 small organic molecules featuring 14 elements (H, B, C, N, O, F, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, As, Se, Br) and 47 functional groups. Using density functional theory at the B3LYP/TZVP level, we optimized the geometries and calculated properties including energy, atomic charge, atomic force, dipole moment, quadrupole moment, polarizability, octupole moment, first hyperpolarizability, and Hessian. At the same level, we obtained the harmonic IR, Raman and NMR spectra. Furthermore, we conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to generate dynamic configurations and extract nonequilibrium properties, including energy, forces, and Hessians. By leveraging our E(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network (DetaNet), we demonstrated that models trained on QMe14S outperform those trained on the previously developed QM9S dataset in simulating molecular spectra. The QMe14S dataset thus serves as a comprehensive benchmark for molecular simulations, offering valuable insights into structure-property relationships.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4figures |

Despite their strong predictive capabilities, these models lack a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty, which is key in scientific applications such as PDE solving, molecular generation and Machine Learning Force Fields. To address this shortcoming we present BARNN: a variational Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network. BARNNs aim to provide a principled way to turn any autoregressive or recurrent model into its Bayesian version. BARNN is based on the variational dropout method, allowing to apply it to large recurrent neural networks as well. We also introduce a temporal version of the "Variational Mixtures of Posteriors" prior (tVAMP-prior) to make Bayesian inference efficient and well-calibrated. Extensive experiments on PDE modelling and molecular generation demonstrate that BARNN not only achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, but also excels in uncertainty quantification and modelling long-range dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Chemical Design and Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21422v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced computational chemistry research in various tasks. However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for chemicals. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Discrete Denoising Diffusion Model for Molecular Generation with OpenFL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12523v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating unique molecules with biochemically desired properties to serve as viable drug candidates is a difficult task that requires specialized domain expertise. In recent years, diffusion models have shown promising results in accelerating the drug design process through AI-driven molecular generation. However, training these models requires massive amounts of data, which are often isolated in proprietary silos. OpenFL is a federated learning framework that enables privacy-preserving collaborative training across these decentralized data sites. In this work, we present a federated discrete denoising diffusion model that was trained using OpenFL. The federated model achieves comparable performance with a model trained on centralized data when evaluating the uniqueness and validity of the generated molecules. This demonstrates the utility of federated learning in the drug design process. OpenFL is available at: https://github.com/securefederatedai/openfl</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Learning to generate feasible graphs using graph grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06003v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative methods for graphs need to be sufficiently flexible to model complex dependencies between sets of nodes. At the same time, the generated graphs need to satisfy domain-dependent feasibility conditions, that is, they should not violate certain constraints that would make their interpretation impossible within the given application domain (e.g. a molecular graph where an atom has a very large number of chemical bounds). Crucially, constraints can involve not only local but also long-range dependencies: for example, the maximal length of a cycle can be bounded. Currently, a large class of generative approaches for graphs, such as methods based on artificial neural networks, is based on message passing schemes. These approaches suffer from information 'dilution' issues that severely limit the maximal range of the dependencies that can be modeled. To address this problem, we propose a generative approach based on the notion of graph grammars. The key novel idea is to introduce a domain-dependent coarsening procedure to provide short-cuts for long-range dependencies. We show the effectiveness of our proposal in two domains: 1) small drugs and 2) RNA secondary structures. In the first case, we compare the quality of the generated molecular graphs via the Molecular Sets (MOSES) benchmark suite, which evaluates the distance between generated and real molecules, their lipophilicity, synthesizability, and drug-likeness. In the second case, we show that the approach can generate very large graphs (with hundreds of nodes) that are accepted as valid examples for a desired RNA family by the "Infernal" covariance model, a state-of-the-art RNA classifier.

MOFA addresses key challenges in integrating GPU-accelerated computing for GPU-intensive GenAI tasks, including distributed training and inference, alongside CPU- and GPU-optimized tasks for screening and filtering AI-generated MOFs using molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and Monte Carlo simulations. These heterogeneous tasks are unified within an online learning framework that optimizes the utilization of available CPU and GPU resources across HPC systems. Performance metrics from a 450-node (14,400 AMD Zen 3 CPUs + 1800 NVIDIA A100 GPUs) supercomputer run demonstrate that MOFA achieves high-throughput generation of novel MOF structures, with CO$_2$ adsorption capacities ranking among the top 10 in the hypothetical MOF (hMOF) dataset. Furthermore, the production of high-quality MOFs exhibits a linear relationship with the number of nodes utilized. The modular architecture of MOFA will facilitate its integration into other scientific applications that dynamically combine GenAI with large-scale simulations.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Molecular Graph Contrastive Learning with Line Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08589v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trapped by the label scarcity in molecular property prediction and drug design, graph contrastive learning (GCL) came forward. Leading contrastive learning works show two kinds of view generators, that is, random or learnable data corruption and domain knowledge incorporation. While effective, the two ways also lead to molecular semantics altering and limited generalization capability, respectively. To this end, we relate the \textbf{L}in\textbf{E} graph with \textbf{MO}lecular graph co\textbf{N}trastive learning and propose a novel method termed \textit{LEMON}. Specifically, by contrasting the given graph with the corresponding line graph, the graph encoder can freely encode the molecular semantics without omission. Furthermore, we present a new patch with edge attribute fusion and two local contrastive losses enhance information transmission and tackle hard negative samples. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for view generation, superior performance on molecular property prediction suggests the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based 3D molecule generation with neural fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08508v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new representation for 3D molecules based on their continuous atomic density fields. Using this representation, we propose a new model based on walk-jump sampling for unconditional 3D molecule generation in the continuous space using neural fields. Our model, FuncMol, encodes molecular fields into latent codes using a conditional neural field, samples noisy codes from a Gaussian-smoothed distribution with Langevin MCMC (walk), denoises these samples in a single step (jump), and finally decodes them into molecular fields. FuncMol performs all-atom generation of 3D molecules without assumptions on the molecular structure and scales well with the size of molecules, unlike most approaches. Our method achieves competitive results on drug-like molecules and easily scales to macro-cyclic peptides, with at least one order of magnitude faster sampling.

| **[GDiffRetro: Retrosynthesis Prediction with Dual Graph Enhanced Molecular Representation and Diffusion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08001v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrosynthesis prediction focuses on identifying reactants capable of synthesizing a target product. Typically, the retrosynthesis prediction involves two phases: Reaction Center Identification and Reactant Generation. However, we argue that most existing methods suffer from two limitations in the two phases: (i) Existing models do not adequately capture the ``face'' information in molecular graphs for the reaction center identification. (ii) Current approaches for the reactant generation predominantly use sequence generation in a 2D space, which lacks versatility in generating reasonable distributions for completed reactive groups and overlooks molecules' inherent 3D properties. To overcome the above limitations, we propose GDiffRetro. For the reaction center identification, GDiffRetro uniquely integrates the original graph with its corresponding dual graph to represent molecular structures, which helps guide the model to focus more on the faces in the graph. For the reactant generation, GDiffRetro employs a conditional diffusion model in 3D to further transform the obtained synthon into a complete reactant. Our experimental findings reveal that GDiffRetro outperforms state-of-the-art semi-template models across various evaluative metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[D3MES: Diffusion Transformer with multihead equivariant self-attention for 3D molecule generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07077v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting the diverse conformational states of molecules is crucial for advancing fields such as chemistry, material science, and drug development. Despite significant progress in generative models, accurately generating complex and biologically or material-relevant molecular structures remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model for three-dimensional (3D) molecule generation that combines a classifiable diffusion model, Diffusion Transformer, with multihead equivariant self-attention. This method addresses two key challenges: correctly attaching hydrogen atoms in generated molecules through learning representations of molecules after hydrogen atoms are removed; and overcoming the limitations of existing models that cannot generate molecules across multiple classes simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that our model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across several key metrics but also exhibits robustness and versatility, making it highly suitable for early-stage large-scale generation processes in molecular design, followed by validation and further screening to obtain molecules with specific properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenMol: A Drug Discovery Generalist with Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06158v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is a complex process that involves multiple scenarios and stages, such as fragment-constrained molecule generation, hit generation and lead optimization. However, existing molecular generative models can only tackle one or two of these scenarios and lack the flexibility to address various aspects of the drug discovery pipeline. In this paper, we present Generalist Molecular generative model (GenMol), a versatile framework that addresses these limitations by applying discrete diffusion to the Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) molecular representation. GenMol generates SAFE sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering and enhanced computational efficiency. Moreover, under the discrete diffusion framework, we introduce fragment remasking, a strategy that optimizes molecules by replacing fragments with masked tokens and regenerating them, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model trained on SAFE representations in de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization. These experimental results demonstrate that GenMol can tackle a wide range of drug discovery tasks, providing a unified and versatile approach for molecular design.</p></details> |  |

Recently developed deep learning methods, particularly diffusion models have reached competitive performance over traditional cheminformatical approaches. However, these methods are often time-consuming or require extra support from traditional methods. We propose EquiBoost, a boosting model that stacks several equivariant graph transformers as weak learners, to iteratively refine 3D conformations of molecules. Without relying on diffusion techniques, EquiBoost balances accuracy and efficiency more effectively than diffusion-based methods. Notably, compared to the previous state-of-the-art diffusion method, EquiBoost improves generation quality and preserves diversity, achieving considerably better precision of Average Minimum RMSD (AMR) on the GEOM datasets. This work rejuvenates boosting and sheds light on its potential to be a robust alternative to diffusion models in certain scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MADGEN: Mass-Spec attends to De Novo Molecular generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01950v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The annotation (assigning structural chemical identities) of MS/MS spectra remains a significant challenge due to the enormous molecular diversity in biological samples and the limited scope of reference databases. Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the "dark chemical space" without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Exploring Molecule Generation Using Latent Space Graph Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03696v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating molecular graphs is a challenging task due to their discrete nature and the competitive objectives involved. Diffusion models have emerged as SOTA approaches in data generation across various modalities. For molecular graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) as a diffusion backbone have achieved impressive results. Latent space diffusion, where diffusion occurs in a low-dimensional space via an autoencoder, has demonstrated computational efficiency. However, the literature on latent space diffusion for molecular graphs is scarce, and no commonly accepted best practices exist. In this work, we explore different approaches and hyperparameters, contrasting generative flow models (denoising diffusion, flow matching, heat dissipation) and architectures (GNNs and E(3)-equivariant GNNs). Our experiments reveal a high sensitivity to the choice of approach and design decisions.

| **[Navigating Chemical-Linguistic Sharing Space with Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20888v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical language models (CLMs) are prominent for their effectiveness in exploring chemical space and enabling molecular engineering. However, while exploring chemical-linguistic space, CLMs suffer from the gap between natural language and molecular representations. This challenge is primarily due to the inherent modeling differences between molecules and texts: molecules operate unified modeling to learn chemical space, while natural language sequentially models the semantic space. Additionally, the limited availability of high-quality text-to-molecule datasets further exacerbates this challenge. To address the problem, we first verified the information bias in molecular representations from different perspectives. We then developed the Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding (HME) framework, a unified molecular encoder compressing the molecular features from fragment sequence, topology, and conformation with Q-learning. To better model chemical-linguistic space, we further constructed the MCMoD dataset, which contains over one million molecules with various conditions, including properties, fragments, and descriptions. Experimentally, HME promotes CLMs to achieve chemical-linguistic sharing space exploration: (1) chemical space exploration with linguistic guidance, where HME achieves significant improvements (+8.9\% FCD) for molecular design in multiple constraints, even in zero-shot scenarios; (2) linguistic space exploration with molecular guidance, where HME generates textual descriptions with high qualities (+11.6\% BLEU) for molecules. These results highlight the precision of HME in handling multi-objective and cross-domain tasks, as well as its remarkable generalization capability on unseen task combinations. HME offers a new perspective on navigating chemical-linguistic sharing space, advancing the potential of CLMs in both fundamental research and practical applications in chemistry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

We find that a key limitation is not in the molecule generation process itself, but in the poor generalization capabilities of molecular property predictors. We tackle this challenge by creating an active-learning, closed-loop molecule generation pipeline, whereby molecular generative models are iteratively refined on feedback from quantum chemical simulations to improve generalization to new chemical space. Compared against other generative model approaches, only our active learning approach generates molecules with properties that extrapolate beyond the training data (reaching up to 0.44 standard deviations beyond the training data range) and out-of-distribution molecule classification accuracy is improved by 79%. By conditioning molecular generation on thermodynamic stability data from the active-learning loop, the proportion of stable molecules generated is 3.5x higher than the next-best model.</p></details> |  |

Most methods in previous studies learn the semantics and syntax of molecular structures by analyzing molecular graphs or simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings; however, they do not take into account the drug responses of the biological systems consisting of genes and proteins. In this study we propose a deep generative model, Gx2Mol, which utilizes gene expression profiles to generate molecular structures with desirable phenotypes for arbitrary target proteins. In the algorithm, a variational autoencoder is employed as a feature extractor to learn the latent feature distribution of the gene expression profiles. Then, a long short-term memory is leveraged as the chemical generator to produce syntactically valid SMILES strings that satisfy the feature conditions of the gene expression profile extracted by the feature extractor. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that the proposed Gx2Mol model can produce new molecules with potential bioactivities and drug-like properties.</p></details> |  |

Dissipativity is a crucial indicator for dynamical systems that generalizes stability and input-output stability, known to be valid across various systems including robotics, biological systems, and molecular dynamics. By analytically proving the general solution to the nonlinear Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for dissipativity, we propose a differentiable projection that transforms any dynamics represented by neural networks into dissipative ones and a learning method for the transformed dynamics. Utilizing the generality of dissipativity, our method strictly guarantee stability, input-output stability, and energy conservation of trained dynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method against out-of-domain input through applications to robotic arms and fluid dynamics.

For this reason, reducing the number of two-qubit gates is of paramount importance on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. To advance towards more reliable quantum computing, we introduce a framework based on ZX calculus, graph-neural networks and reinforcement learning for quantum circuit optimization. By combining reinforcement learning and tree search, our method addresses the challenge of selecting optimal sequences of ZX calculus rewrite rules. Instead of relying on existing heuristic rules for minimizing circuits, our method trains a novel reinforcement learning policy that directly operates on ZX-graphs, therefore allowing us to search through the space of all possible circuit transformations to find a circuit significantly minimizing the number of CNOT gates. This way we can scale beyond hard-coded rules towards discovering arbitrary optimization rules. We demonstrate our method's competetiveness with state-of-the-art circuit optimizers and generalization capabilities on large sets of diverse random circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proximal Policy Optimization with Graph Neural Networks for Optimal Power Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12470v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a very traditional research area within the power systems field that seeks for the optimal operation point of electric power plants, and which needs to be solved every few minutes in real-world scenarios. However, due to the nonconvexities that arise in power generation systems, there is not yet a fast, robust solution technique for the full Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). In the last decades, power grids have evolved into a typical dynamic, non-linear and large-scale control system, known as the power system, so searching for better and faster ACOPF solutions is becoming crucial. Appearance of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has allowed the natural use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on graph data, such as power networks. On the other hand, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is known for its powerful capability to solve complex decision-making problems. Although solutions that use these two methods separately are beginning to appear in the literature, none has yet combined the advantages of both. We propose a novel architecture based on the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm with Graph Neural Networks to solve the Optimal Power Flow. The objective is to design an architecture that learns how to solve the optimization problem and that is at the same time able to generalize to unseen scenarios. We compare our solution with the DCOPF in terms of cost after having trained our DRL agent on IEEE 30 bus system and then computing the OPF on that base network with topology changes</p></details> |  |

In Music Recommendation too](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02598v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graphs have gained prominence across various domains, especially in recommendation systems. Within the realm of music recommendation, graphs play a crucial role in enhancing genre-based recommendations by integrating Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) with advanced graph embeddings. This study explores the efficacy of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Transformer (GT) models in learning embeddings that effectively capture intricate relationships between music items and genres represented within graph structures. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse real-world music datasets, our findings consistently demonstrate that these graph-based approaches outperform traditional methods that rely solely on MFCC features or collaborative filtering techniques. Specifically, the graph-enhanced models achieve notably higher accuracy in predicting genre-specific preferences and offering relevant music suggestions to users. These results underscore the effectiveness of utilizing graph embeddings to enrich feature representations and exploit latent associations within music data, thereby illustrating their potential to advance the capabilities of personalized and context-aware music recommendation systems.

Nevertheless, due to the vulnerabilities of GNNs, it has been empirically proved that malicious attackers could easily corrupt the fairness level of their predictions by adding perturbations to the input graph data. In this paper, we take crucial steps to study a novel problem of certifiable defense on the fairness level of GNNs. Specifically, we propose a principled framework named ELEGANT and present a detailed theoretical certification analysis for the fairness of GNNs. ELEGANT takes any GNNs as its backbone, and the fairness level of such a backbone is theoretically impossible to be corrupted under certain perturbation budgets for attackers. Notably, ELEGANT does not have any assumption over the GNN structure or parameters, and does not require re-training the GNNs to realize certification. Hence it can serve as a plug-and-play framework for any optimized GNNs ready to be deployed. We verify the satisfactory effectiveness of ELEGANT in practice through extensive experiments on real-world datasets across different backbones of GNNs, where ELEGANT is also demonstrated to be beneficial for GNN debiasing.

Despite these advancements, the performance of GNNs on heterogeneous graphs often remains complex, with networks generally underperforming compared to their homogeneous counterparts. This work benchmarks various GNN architectures to identify the most effective methods for heterogeneous graphs, with a particular focus on node classification and link prediction. Our findings reveal that graph attention networks excel in these tasks. As a main contribution, we explore enhancements to these attention networks by integrating positional encodings for node embeddings. This involves utilizing the full Laplacian spectrum to accurately capture both the relative and absolute positions of each node within the graph, further enhancing performance on downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

The architecture and connectivity of the MI-HGNN are constructed from the robot morphology, in which nodes and edges are robot joints and links, respectively. By incorporating the morphology-informed constraints into a neural network, we improve a learning-based approach using model-based knowledge. We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots.

| **[A Hybrid Similarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02615v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node classification has gained significant importance in graph deep learning with real-world applications such as recommendation systems, drug discovery, and citation networks. Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Transformers have achieved superior performance in node classification tasks. However, the key concern with Graph Convolutional Networks is over-squashing, which limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies in the network. Additionally, Graph Transformers face scalability challenges, making it difficult to process large graphs efficiently. To address this, we propose a novel framework, A Hybrid SImilarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification (SIGNNet), which capitalizes on local and global structural information, enhances the model's capability to effectively capture fine-grained relationships and broader contextual patterns within the graph structure. The proposed method leverages Graph Convolutional Networks alongside a score-based mechanism to effectively capture local and global node interactions while addressing the limitations of over-squashing. Our proposed method employs a novel Personalized PageRank-based node sampling method to address scalability issues by generating subgraphs of nodes. Additionally, SIGNNet incorporates a novel attention mechanism, Structure-Aware Multi-Head Attention (SA-MHA), which integrates node structural information for informed attention weighting, enabling the model to prioritize nodes based on topological significance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods, with average accuracy gains of 6.03%, 5.47%, 4.78%, 19.10%, 19.61%, 7.22%, 19.54%, and 14.94% on Cora, Citeseer, CS, Wisconsin, Texas, Actor, Cornell and Chameleon datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEAK: Streaming Network for Continual Learning of Object Relocations under Household Context Drifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05549v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world settings, robots are expected to assist humans across diverse tasks and still continuously adapt to dynamic changes over time. For example, in domestic environments, robots can proactively help users by fetching needed objects based on learned routines, which they infer by observing how objects move over time. However, data from these interactions are inherently non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.), e.g., a robot assisting multiple users may encounter varying data distributions as individuals follow distinct habits. This creates a challenge: integrating new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose STREAK (Spatio Temporal RElocation with Adaptive Knowledge retention), a continual learning framework for real-world robotic learning. It leverages a streaming graph neural network with regularization and rehearsal techniques to mitigate context drifts while retaining past knowledge. Our method is time- and memory-efficient, enabling long-term learning without retraining on all past data, which becomes infeasible as data grows in real-world interactions. We evaluate STREAK on the task of incrementally predicting human routines over 50+ days across different households. Results show that it effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting while maintaining generalization, making it a scalable solution for long-term human-robot interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward General and Robust LLM-enhanced Text-attributed Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02343v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the proliferation of Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) across various domains have positioned LLM-enhanced TAG learning as a critical research area. By utilizing rich graph descriptions, this paradigm leverages LLMs to generate high-quality embeddings, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the field faces significant challenges: (1) the absence of a unified framework to systematize the diverse optimization perspectives arising from the complex interactions between LLMs and GNNs, and (2) the lack of a robust method capable of handling real-world TAGs, which often suffer from texts and edge sparsity, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose UltraTAG, a unified pipeline for LLM-enhanced TAG learning. UltraTAG provides a unified comprehensive and domain-adaptive framework that not only organizes existing methodologies but also paves the way for future advancements in the field. Building on this framework, we propose UltraTAG-S, a robust instantiation of UltraTAG designed to tackle the inherent sparsity issues in real-world TAGs. UltraTAG-S employs LLM-based text propagation and text augmentation to mitigate text sparsity, while leveraging LLM-augmented node selection techniques based on PageRank and edge reconfiguration strategies to address edge sparsity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraTAG-S significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving improvements of 2.12\% and 17.47\% in ideal and sparse settings, respectively. Moreover, as the data sparsity ratio increases, the performance improvement of UltraTAG-S also rises, which underscores the effectiveness and robustness of UltraTAG-S.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Customer Contact Efficiency with Graph Neural Networks in Credit Card Fraud Detection Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02275v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Credit card fraud has been a persistent issue since the last century, causing significant financial losses to the industry. The most effective way to prevent fraud is by contacting customers to verify suspicious transactions. However, while these systems are designed to detect fraudulent activity, they often mistakenly flag legitimate transactions, leading to unnecessary declines that disrupt the user experience and erode customer trust. Frequent false positives can frustrate customers, resulting in dissatisfaction, increased complaints, and a diminished sense of security. To address these limitations, we propose a fraud detection framework incorporating Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying fraudulent transactions. By leveraging the relational structure of transaction data, our model reduces the need for direct customer confirmation while maintaining high detection performance. Our experiments are conducted using the IBM credit card transaction dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.</p></details> |  |

While user-written comments provide explicit insights about preferences, merging these textual representations from large language models (LLMs) with graph-based embeddings of user actions remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose a framework that employs both a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based model and an LLM to produce review-aware representations, preserving review semantics while mitigating textual noise. Our approach utilizes a hybrid objective that balances user-item interactions against text-derived features, ensuring that user's both behavioral and linguistic signals are effectively captured. We evaluate this method on multiple datasets from diverse application domains, demonstrating consistent improvements over a baseline GNN-based recommender model. Notably, our model achieves significant gains in recommendation accuracy when review data is sparse or unevenly distributed. These findings highlight the importance of integrating LLM-driven textual feedback with GNN-derived user behavioral patterns to develop robust, context-aware recommender systems.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Reducing Smoothness with Expressive Memory Enhanced Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00349v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical forecasting models learn the structure of time series data via projecting onto a graph, with recent techniques capturing spatial-temporal associations between variables via edge weights. Hierarchical variants offer a distinct advantage by analysing the time series across multiple resolutions, making them particularly effective in tasks like global weather forecasting, where low-resolution variable interactions are significant. A critical challenge in hierarchical models is information loss during forward or backward passes through the hierarchy. We propose the Hierarchical Graph Flow (HiGFlow) network, which introduces a memory buffer variable of dynamic size to store previously seen information across variable resolutions. We theoretically show two key results: HiGFlow reduces smoothness when mapping onto new feature spaces in the hierarchy and non-strictly enhances the utility of message-passing by improving Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) expressivity. Empirical results demonstrate that HiGFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including transformer models, by at least an average of 6.1% in MAE and 6.2% in RMSE.

| **[OmniCellTOSG: The First Cell Text-Omic Signaling Graphs Dataset for Joint LLM and GNN Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02148v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex cell signaling systems -- governed by varying protein abundances and interactions -- generate diverse cell types across organs. These systems evolve under influences such as age, sex, diet, environmental exposures, and diseases, making them challenging to decode given the involvement of tens of thousands of genes and proteins. Recently, hundreds of millions of single-cell omics data have provided a robust foundation for understanding these signaling networks within various cell subpopulations and conditions. Inspired by the success of large foundation models (for example, large language models and large vision models) pre-trained on massive datasets, we introduce OmniCellTOSG, the first dataset of cell text-omic signaling graphs (TOSGs). Each TOSG represents the signaling network of an individual or meta-cell and is labeled with information such as organ, disease, sex, age, and cell subtype. OmniCellTOSG offers two key contributions. First, it introduces a novel graph model that integrates human-readable annotations -- such as biological functions, cellular locations, signaling pathways, related diseases, and drugs -- with quantitative gene and protein abundance data, enabling graph reasoning to decode cell signaling. This approach calls for new joint models combining large language models and graph neural networks. Second, the dataset is built from single-cell RNA sequencing data of approximately 120 million cells from diverse tissues and conditions (healthy and diseased) and is fully compatible with PyTorch. This facilitates the development of innovative cell signaling models that could transform research in life sciences, healthcare, and precision medicine. The OmniCellTOSG dataset is continuously expanding and will be updated regularly. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/FuhaiLiAiLab/OmniCellTOSG.</p></details> |  |

Current methods often struggle with sparse or noisy data and rely on static graphs, limiting their ability to capture dynamic changes between nodes and relationships. This paper introduces LL4G, a self-supervised framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to optimize graph neural networks (GNNs). LLMs extract rich semantic features to generate node representations and to infer explicit and implicit relationships. The graph structure adaptively adds nodes and edges based on input data, continuously optimizing itself. The GNN then uses these optimized representations for joint training on node reconstruction, edge prediction, and contrastive learning tasks. This integration of semantic and structural information generates robust personality profiles. Experimental results on Kaggle and Pandora datasets show LL4G outperforms state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Text to Graph: Leveraging Graph Neural Networks for Enhanced Explainability in NLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02064v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have relegated natural language processing tasks to Transformer-type models, particularly generative models, because these models exhibit high versatility when performing generation and classification tasks. As the size of these models increases, they achieve outstanding results. Given their widespread use, many explainability techniques are developed based on these models. However, this process becomes computationally expensive due to the large size of the models. Additionally, transformers interpret input information through tokens that fragment input words into sequences lacking inherent semantic meaning, complicating the explanation of the model from the very beginning. This study proposes a novel methodology to achieve explainability in natural language processing tasks by automatically converting sentences into graphs and maintaining semantics through nodes and relations that express fundamental linguistic concepts. It also allows the subsequent exploitation of this knowledge in subsequent tasks, making it possible to obtain trends and understand how the model associates the different elements inside the text with the explained task. The experiments delivered promising results in determining the most critical components within the text structure for a given classification.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Abusive Language Detection (ALD) models often overlook this context, which can lead to unreliable performance metrics. Recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods that integrate conversational context often depend on limited and simplified representations, and report inconsistent results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) to model social media conversations as graphs, where nodes represent comments, and edges capture reply structures. We systematically investigate various graph representations and context windows to identify the optimal configuration for ALD. Our GNN model outperform both context-agnostic baselines and linear context-aware methods, achieving significant improvements in F1 scores. These findings demonstrate the critical role of structured conversational context and establish GNNs as a robust framework for advancing context-aware abusive language detection.</p></details> |  |

We train them to predict spatial position of points in a discrete 2D grid from a set of constraints that uniquely describe hidden figures containing these points. Both models are able to predict the position of points and interestingly, they form the hidden figures described by the input constraints in the embedding space during the reasoning process. Our analysis shows that both models recover the grid structure during training so that the embeddings corresponding to the points within the grid organize themselves in a 2D subspace and reflect the neighborhood structure of the grid. We also show that the Graph Neural Network we design for the task performs significantly better than the Transformer and is also easier to scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00490v4)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by WWW2025</p></details> |

We consider various obfuscation types and obfuscators, resulting in two complex datasets.

In recent years, various studies in the vision domain have made notable advancements in this area. However, the varying topological structures and non-grid nature of graph data render the methods from the vision domain ineffective. Building upon prior research into differentiable methods for graph neural networks, we propose a fast and high-quality data-free knowledge distillation approach in this paper. Without compromising distillation quality, the proposed graph-free KD method (ACGKD) significantly reduces the spatial complexity of pseudo-graphs by leveraging the Binary Concrete distribution to model the graph structure and introducing a spatial complexity tuning parameter. This approach enables efficient gradient computation for the graph structure, thereby accelerating the overall distillation process. Additionally, ACGKD eliminates the dimensional ambiguity between the student and teacher models by increasing the student's dimensions and reusing the teacher's classifier. Moreover, it equips graph knowledge distillation with a CL-based strategy to ensure the student learns graph structures progressively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACGKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in distilling knowledge from GNNs without training data.</p></details> |  |

The conventional approaches extended from optimization perspectives are usually quite involved, especially when jointly considering factors in different scales such as deployment and transmission in UAV-related scenarios. In this paper, we address the UAV-enabled multi-user secure communications by proposing a deep graph reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we reinterpret the security beamforming as a graph neural network (GNN) learning task, where mutual interference among users is managed through the message-passing mechanism. Then, the UAV deployment is obtained through soft actor-critic reinforcement learning, where the GNN-based security beamforming is exploited to guide the deployment strategy update. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal security performance and significantly enhances the efficiency of strategy determination. Moreover, the deep graph reinforcement learning framework offers a scalable solution, adaptable to various network scenarios and configurations, establishing a robust basis for information security in UAV-enabled communications.</p></details> | Accepted at IEEE TMC |

Most existing methods feed textual descriptions of the graph structure or neighbouring nodes' text directly into LLMs. However, these approaches often cause LLMs to treat structural information simply as general contextual text, thus limiting their effectiveness in graph-related tasks. In this paper, we introduce LanSAGNN (Language Semantic Anisotropic Graph Neural Network), a framework that extends the concept of anisotropic GNNs to the natural language level. This model leverages LLMs to extract tailor-made semantic information for node pairs, effectively capturing the unique interactions within node relationships. In addition, we propose an efficient dual-layer LLMs finetuning architecture to better align LLMs' outputs with graph tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LanSAGNN significantly enhances existing LLM-based methods without increasing complexity while also exhibiting strong robustness against interference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |

Existing deep learning methods tend to ignore the information of internal sub-structural features of drug molecules and drug-target interactions, resulting in limited prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a drug-target association prediction model HCAF-DTA based on cross-attention fusion hypergraph neural network. The model innovatively introduces hypergraph representation in the feature extraction stage: drug molecule hypergraphs are constructed based on the tree decomposition algorithm, and the sub-structural and global features extracted by fusing the hypergraph neural network with the graphical neural network through hopping connections, in which the hyper edges can efficiently characterise the functional functional groups and other key chemical features; for the protein feature extraction, a weighted graph is constructed based on the residues predicted by the ESM model contact maps to construct weighted graphs, and multilayer graph neural networks were used to capture spatial dependencies. In the prediction stage, a bidirectional multi-head cross-attention mechanism is designed to model intermolecular interactions from the dual viewpoints of atoms and amino acids, and cross-modal features with correlated information are fused by attention. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Davis and KIBA show that HCAF-DTA outperforms state of the arts in all three performance evaluation metrics, with the MSE metrics reaching 0.198 and 0.122, respectively, with an improvement of up to 4% from the optimal baseline.</p></details> |  |

It leads to a decline in memory, reasoning ability, and behavior, especially in older people. The cause of Alzheimer's Disease is still under exploration and there is no all-inclusive theory that can explain the pathologies in each individual patient. Nevertheless, early intervention has been found to be effective in managing symptoms and slowing down the disease's progression. Recent research has utilized electroencephalography (EEG) data to identify biomarkers that distinguish Alzheimer's Disease patients from healthy individuals. Prior studies have used various machine learning methods, including deep learning and graph neural networks, to examine electroencephalography-based signals for identifying Alzheimer's Disease patients. In our research, we proposed a Flexible and Explainable Gated Graph Convolutional Network (GGCN) with Multi-Objective Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (MOTPE) hyperparameter tuning. This provides a flexible solution that efficiently identifies the optimal number of GGCN blocks to achieve the optimized precision, specificity, and recall outcomes, as well as the optimized area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC). Our findings demonstrated a high efficacy with an over 0.9 Receiver Operating Characteristic score, alongside precision, specificity, and recall scores in distinguishing health control with Alzheimer's Disease patients in Moderate to Severe Dementia using the power spectrum density (PSD) of electroencephalography signals across various frequency bands. Moreover, our research enhanced the interpretability of the embedded adjacency matrices, revealing connectivity differences in frontal and parietal brain regions between Alzheimer's patients and healthy individuals.</p></details> |  |

Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently emerged as leading models in geometric deep learning, outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in various graph learning tasks. However, the development of tokenizers for graphs has lagged behind other modalities. To address this, we introduce GQT (\textbf{G}raph \textbf{Q}uantized \textbf{T}okenizer), which decouples tokenizer training from Transformer training by leveraging multi-task graph self-supervised learning, yielding robust and generalizable graph tokens. Furthermore, the GQT utilizes Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to learn hierarchical discrete tokens, resulting in significantly reduced memory requirements and improved generalization capabilities. By combining the GQT with token modulation, a Transformer encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on 20 out of 22 benchmarks, including large-scale homophilic and heterophilic datasets.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, GNNs may produce biased predictions against certain demographic subgroups due to node attributes and neighbors surrounding a node. Most current research on GNN fairness focuses predominantly on debiasing GNNs using oversimplified fairness evaluation metrics, which can give a misleading impression of fairness. Understanding the potential evaluation paradoxes due to the complicated nature of the graph structure is crucial for developing effective GNN debiasing mechanisms. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of current GNN debiasing methods in terms of unfairness evaluation. Specifically, we introduce a community-level strategy to measure bias in GNNs and evaluate debiasing methods at this level. Further, We introduce ComFairGNN, a novel framework designed to mitigate community-level bias in GNNs. Our approach employs a learnable coreset-based debiasing function that addresses bias arising from diverse local neighborhood distributions during GNNs neighborhood aggregation. Comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate our model's effectiveness in both accuracy and fairness metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at PAKDD 2025</p></details> |

We introduce several training improvements, particularly a novel closest assignment supervision method that dynamically adapts to the model's current state, significantly enhancing performance on problems with larger solution spaces. Our experiments demonstrate the suitability of variable-clause graph representations with recurrent neural network updates, which achieve good accuracy on SAT assignment prediction while reducing computational demands. We extend the base graph neural network into a diffusion model that facilitates incremental sampling and can be effectively combined with classical techniques like unit propagation. Through analysis of embedding space patterns and optimization trajectories, we show how these networks implicitly perform a process very similar to continuous relaxations of MaxSAT, offering an interpretable view of their reasoning process. This understanding guides our design choices and explains the ability of recurrent architectures to scale effectively at inference time beyond their training distribution, which we demonstrate with test-time scaling experiments.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, our method yields a modest speedup of approximately 17% over conventional simulation techniques. These results indicate that the integration of deep learning with traditional physical simulation methods offers a promising pathway to significantly enhance computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, accepted in conference MAEB 2025 (more info at https://www.uik.eus/es/curso/xvi-congreso-espanol-metaheuristicas-algoritmos-evolutivos-bioinspirados)</p></details> |

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown promise in modeling brain connectivity for AD diagnosis, yet their reliance on linear transformations limits their ability to capture intricate nonlinear patterns in neuroimaging data. To address this, we propose GCN-KAN, a novel single-modal framework that integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) into GCNs to enhance both diagnostic accuracy and interpretability. Leveraging structural MRI data, our model employs learnable spline-based transformations to better represent brain region interactions. Evaluated on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, GCN-KAN outperforms traditional GCNs by 4-8% in classification accuracy while providing interpretable insights into key brain regions associated with AD.

Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets and established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with respect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most comprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the honey bee (Apis mellifera), an ecologically vital pollinator. We evaluate ApisTox using a diverse suite of machine learning approaches, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as well as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical space. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as ApisTox, demonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art algorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for more diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the agrochemical domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Designing Heterogeneous GNNs with Desired Permutation Properties for Wireless Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03906v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been designed for learning a variety of wireless policies, i.e., the mappings from environment parameters to decision variables, thanks to their superior performance, and the potential in enabling scalability and size generalizability. These merits are rooted in leveraging permutation prior, i.e., satisfying the permutation property of the policy to be learned (referred to as desired permutation property). Many wireless policies are with complicated permutation properties. To satisfy these properties, heterogeneous GNNs (HetGNNs) should be used to learn such policies. There are two critical factors that enable a HetGNN to satisfy a desired permutation property: constructing an appropriate heterogeneous graph and judiciously designing the architecture of the HetGNN. However, both the graph and the HetGNN are designed heuristically so far. In this paper, we strive to provide a systematic approach for the design to satisfy the desired permutation property. We first propose a method for constructing a graph for a policy, where the edges and their types are defined for the sake of satisfying complicated permutation properties. Then, we provide and prove three sufficient conditions to design a HetGNN such that it can satisfy the desired permutation property when learning over an appropriate graph. These conditions suggest a method of designing the HetGNN with desired permutation property by sharing the processing, combining, and pooling functions according to the types of vertices and edges of the graph. We take power allocation and hybrid precoding policies as examples for demonstrating how to apply the proposed methods and validating the impact of the permutation prior by simulations.</p></details> |  |

Graphs from real-world datasets often evolve over time, with newly emerging edges and dynamically changing node properties, posing a significant challenge for this problem. In response, temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have been developed to predict dynamic node properties from a stream of emerging edges. However, our analysis reveals that most TGNN-based methods are (a) far less effective without proper node features and, due to their complex model architectures, (b) vulnerable to distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose SPLASH, a simple yet powerful method for predicting node properties on edge streams under distribution shifts. Our key contributions are as follows: (1) we propose feature augmentation methods and an automatic feature selection method for edge streams, which improve the effectiveness of TGNNs, (2) we propose a lightweight MLP-based TGNN architecture that is highly efficient and robust under distribution shifts, and (3) we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, generalization, and qualitative performance of the proposed method and its competitors on dynamic node classification, dynamic anomaly detection, and node affinity prediction tasks across seven real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, To Appear in ICDE 2025</p></details> |

Existing GNNs primarily operate in Euclidean spaces, which can limit their ability to capture hierarchical and multi-relational structures inherent to complex graphs. LGIN addresses this by incorporating curvature-aware aggregation functions that preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor, ensuring embeddings remain constrained within the hyperbolic space by proposing a new update rule that effectively captures both local neighborhood interactions and global structural properties, enabling LGIN to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs with expressiveness at least as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Through extensive evaluation across nine benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures, LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNNs, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy in modeling complex graph structures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to extend the concept of a powerful graph neural network to Riemannian manifolds, paving the way for future advancements in hyperbolic graph learning.

Therefore, they need to constantly monitor vast amounts of incoming and outgoing transactions. A particular challenge in detecting money laundering is that money launderers continuously adapt their tactics to evade detection. Hence, detection methods need constant fine-tuning. Traditional machine learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning the model on new data, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments. Continual learning methods may address this issue and enhance current anti-money laundering (AML) practices, by allowing models to incorporate new information while retaining prior knowledge. Research on continual graph learning for AML, however, is still scarce. In this review, we critically evaluate state-of-the-art continual graph learning approaches for AML applications. We categorise methods into replay-based, regularization-based, and architecture-based strategies within the graph neural network (GNN) framework, and we provide in-depth experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world AML data sets that showcase the effect of the different hyperparameters. Our analysis demonstrates that continual learning improves model adaptability and robustness in the face of extreme class imbalances and evolving fraud patterns. Finally, we outline key challenges and propose directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Engineering in Large-scale Networks with Generalizable Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24203v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic engineering (TE) in large-scale computer networks has become a fundamental yet challenging problem, owing to the swift growth of global-scale cloud wide-area networks or backbone low-Earth-orbit satellite constellations. To address the scalability issue of traditional TE algorithms, learning-based approaches have been proposed, showing potential of significant efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Nevertheless, the intrinsic limitations of existing learning-based methods hinder their practical application: they are not generalizable across diverse topologies and network conditions, incur excessive training overhead, and do not respect link capacities by default. This paper proposes TELGEN, a novel TE algorithm that learns to solve TE problems efficiently in large-scale networks, while achieving superior generalizability across diverse network conditions. TELGEN is based on the novel idea of transforming the problem of "predicting the optimal TE solution" into "predicting the optimal TE algorithm", which enables TELGEN to learn and efficiently approximate the end-to-end solving process of classical optimal TE algorithms. The learned algorithm is agnostic to the exact network topology or traffic patterns, and can efficiently solve TE problems given arbitrary inputs and generalize well to unseen topologies and demands. We trained and evaluated TELGEN on random and real-world networks with up to 5000 nodes and 106 links. TELGEN achieved less than 3% optimality gap while ensuring feasibility in all cases, even when the test network had up to 20x more nodes than the largest in training. It also saved up to 84% solving time than classical optimal solver, and could reduce training time per epoch and solving time by 2-4 orders of magnitude than latest learning algorithms on the largest networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backdoor Graph Condensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11025v4)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation has recently emerged as a prevalent technique to improve the training efficiency for graph neural networks (GNNs). It condenses a large graph into a small one such that a GNN trained on this small synthetic graph can achieve comparable performance to a GNN trained on the large graph. However, while existing graph condensation studies mainly focus on the best trade-off between graph size and the GNNs' performance (model utility), they overlook the security issues of graph condensation. To bridge this gap, we first explore backdoor attack against the GNNs trained on the condensed graphs. We introduce an effective backdoor attack against graph condensation, termed BGC. This attack aims to (1) preserve the condensed graph quality despite trigger injection, and (2) ensure trigger efficacy through the condensation process, achieving a high attack success rate. Specifically, BGC consistently updates triggers during condensation and targets representative nodes for poisoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. BGC achieves a high attack success rate (close to 1.0) and good model utility in all cases. Furthermore, the results against multiple defense methods demonstrate BGC's resilience under their defenses. Finally, we analyze the key hyperparameters that influence the attack performance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/JiahaoWuGit/BGC.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICDE ...</summary><p>ICDE 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

The latter consists of spray-based printing of cementitious plaster on a wall and is facilitated with the use of a robotic arm. The predictions are computed using the robotic arm trajectory features, such as position, velocity and direction, as well as the printing process parameters. The proposed approach, based on a particle representation of the wall domain and the end effector, allows for the adoption of a graph-based solution. The GNN model consists of an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and is trained using data from laboratory tests, while the hyperparameters are optimized by means of a Bayesian scheme. The aim of this model is to act as a simulator of the printing process, and ultimately used for the generation of the robotic arm trajectory and the optimization of the printing parameters, towards the materialization of an autonomous plastering process. The performance of the proposed model is assessed in terms of the prediction error against unseen ground truth data, which shows its generality in varied scenarios, as well as in comparison with the performance of an existing benchmark model. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the benchmark model, with notably better performance and enhanced error scaling across prediction steps.</p></details> |  |

While classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are renowned for their scalability and robustness, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum circuit designs, limiting their applicability to a narrower range of graph-structured problems, falling short of real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by the classical GraphSAGE approach, utilizing quantum models as aggregators. In this work, we integrate established techniques for inductive representation learning on graphs with parametrized quantum convolutional and pooling layers, effectively bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer is flexible, enabling tailored designs for specific problems. Benchmarked on a node regression task with the QM9 dataset, we demonstrate that our framework successfully models a non-trivial molecular dataset, achieving performance comparable to classical GNNs. In particular, we show that our quantum approach exhibits robust generalization across molecules with varying numbers of atoms without requiring circuit modifications, slightly outperforming classical GNNs. Furthermore, we numerically investigate the scalability of the QGNN framework. Specifically, we demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus in our architecture as the number of qubits increases, suggesting that the proposed quantum model can be extended to handle larger and more complex graph-based problems effectively.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

However, optimizing donor-acceptor (D-A) combinations to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE) remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates large-scale pretraining of graph neural networks (GNNs) with a GPT-2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 2)-based reinforcement learning (RL) strategy to design OPV molecules with potentially high PCE. This approach produces candidate molecules with predicted efficiencies approaching 21\%, although further experimental validation is required. Moreover, we conducted a preliminary fragment-level analysis to identify structural motifs recognized by the RL model that may contribute to enhanced PCE, thus providing design guidelines for the broader research community. To facilitate continued discovery, we are building the largest open-source OPV dataset to date, expected to include nearly 3,000 donor-acceptor pairs.

Traditional influence maximization strategies often fail to keep up with rapidly evolving relationships and structures, leading to missed opportunities and inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a novel learning-based approach integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) models. This hybrid framework captures both structural and temporal dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of candidate nodes for seed set selection. The bidirectional nature of BiLSTM allows our model to analyze patterns from both past and future network states, ensuring adaptability to changes over time. By dynamically adapting to graph evolution at each time snapshot, our approach improves seed set calculation efficiency, achieving an average of 90% accuracy in predicting potential seed nodes across diverse networks. This significantly reduces computational overhead by optimizing the number of nodes evaluated for seed selection. Our method is particularly effective in fields like viral marketing and social network analysis, where understanding temporal dynamics is crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, Accepted in AAAI25 to AI4TS Workshop@AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Addressing the OOD generalization gap is crucial when models are deployed in environments significantly different from the training set, such as applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on small graphs to large, real-world graphs. One promising approach for achieving robust OOD generalization is the framework of neural algorithmic alignment, which incorporates ideas from classical algorithms by designing neural architectures that resemble specific algorithmic paradigms (e.g. dynamic programming). The hope is that trained models of this form would have superior OOD capabilities, in much the same way that classical algorithms work for all instances. We rigorously analyze the role of algorithmic alignment in achieving OOD generalization, focusing on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to the canonical shortest path problem. We prove that GNNs, trained to minimize a sparsity-regularized loss over a small set of shortest path instances, exactly implement the Bellman-Ford (BF) algorithm for shortest paths. In fact, if a GNN minimizes this loss within an error of $\epsilon$, it implements the BF algorithm with an error of $O(\epsilon)$. Consequently, despite limited training data, these GNNs are guaranteed to extrapolate to arbitrary shortest-path problems, including instances of any size. Our empirical results support our theory by showing that NNs trained by gradient descent are able to minimize this loss and extrapolate in practice.</p></details> |  |

We propose HIS_GCNs, a hierarchical importance graph sampling based learning method. By constructing minibatches using sampled subgraphs, HIS_GCNs gives attention to the importance of both core and periphery nodes/edges in a scale-free training graph. Specifically, it preserves the centrum of the core to most minibatches, which maintains connectivity between periphery nodes, and samples periphery edges without core node interference, in order to keep more long chains composed entirely of low-degree nodes in the same minibatch. HIS_GCNs can maximize the discrete Ricci curvature (i.e., Ollivier-Ricci curvatures) of the edges in a subgraph that enables the preservation of important chains for information propagation, and can achieve a low node embedding variance and a high convergence speed. Diverse experiments on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with node classification tasks confirm superior performance of HIS_GCNs in both accuracy and training time.

While advanced models like Transformers and graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, largely due to their success in tasks like language modeling, their added complexity is not always necessary. In our work, we show that simple feedforward neural networks (SFNNs) can achieve performance on par with, or even exceeding, these state-of-the-art models, while being simpler, smaller, faster, and more robust. Our analysis indicates that, in many cases, univariate SFNNs are sufficient, implying that modeling interactions between multiple series may offer only marginal benefits. Even when inter-series relationships are strong, a basic multivariate SFNN still delivers competitive results. We also examine some key design choices and offer guidelines on making informed decisions. Additionally, we critique existing benchmarking practices and propose an improved evaluation protocol. Although SFNNs may not be optimal for every situation (hence the ``almost'' in our title) they serve as a strong baseline that future time series forecasting methods should always be compared against.</p></details> |  |

Equations offer explicit relationships between variables, enabling deeper insights into underlying data patterns. Most existing equation discovery methods rely on genetic programming, which iteratively searches the equation space but is often slow and prone to overfitting. By representing equations as directed acyclic graphs, we leverage the use of graph neural networks to learn the underlying semantics of equations, and generate new, previously unseen equations. Although graph generative models have been shown to be successful in discovering new types of graphs in many fields, there application in discovering equations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose Graph-EQ, a deep graph generative model designed for efficient equation discovery. Graph-EQ uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to learn a rich latent representation of the equation space by training it on a large corpus of equations in an unsupervised manner. Instead of directly searching the equation space, we employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore this learned latent space. We show that the encoder-decoder architecture of Graph-Eq is able to accurately reconstruct input equations. Moreover, we show that the learned latent representation can be sampled and decoded into valid equations, including new and previously unseen equations in the training data. Finally, we assess Graph-Eq's ability to discover equations that best fit a dataset by exploring the latent space using Bayesian optimization. Latent space exploration is done on 20 dataset with known ground-truth equations, and Graph-Eq is shown to successfully discover the grountruth equation in the majority of datasets.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Krait: A Backdoor Attack Against Graph Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13068v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph prompt tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm to effectively transfer general graph knowledge from pre-trained models to various downstream tasks, particularly in few-shot contexts. However, its susceptibility to backdoor attacks, where adversaries insert triggers to manipulate outcomes, raises a critical concern. We conduct the first study to investigate such vulnerability, revealing that backdoors can disguise benign graph prompts, thus evading detection. We introduce Krait, a novel graph prompt backdoor. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic metric called label non-uniformity homophily to select poisoned candidates, significantly reducing computational complexity. To accommodate diverse attack scenarios and advanced attack types, we design three customizable trigger generation methods to craft prompts as triggers. We propose a novel centroid similarity-based loss function to optimize prompt tuning for attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Experiments on four real-world graphs demonstrate that Krait can efficiently embed triggers to merely 0.15% to 2% of training nodes, achieving high attack success rates without sacrificing clean accuracy. Notably, in one-to-one and all-to-one attacks, Krait can achieve 100% attack success rates by poisoning as few as 2 and 22 nodes, respectively. Our experiments further show that Krait remains potent across different transfer cases, attack types, and graph neural network backbones. Additionally, Krait can be successfully extended to the black-box setting, posing more severe threats. Finally, we analyze why Krait can evade both classical and state-of-the-art defenses, and provide practical insights for detecting and mitigating this class of attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SaTML'2025</p></details> |
| **[Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting for Enhancing Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23523v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with tasks requiring external knowledge, such as knowledge-intensive Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA). Integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can enhance reasoning; however, existing methods typically demand costly fine-tuning or retrieve noisy KG information. Recent approaches leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate KG-based input embedding prefixes as soft prompts for LLMs but fail to account for question relevance, resulting in noisy prompts. Moreover, in MCQA tasks, the absence of relevant KG knowledge for certain answer options remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting (QAP), which incorporates question embeddings into GNN aggregation to dynamically assess KG relevance. QAP employs global attention to capture inter-option relationships, enriching soft prompts with inferred knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that QAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, the field lacks a standardized workflow that encompasses prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, ML interpretability, and polymer synthesizability. In this study, we introduce POINT$^{2}$ (POlymer INformatics Training and Testing), a comprehensive benchmark database and protocol designed to address these critical challenges. Leveraging the existing labeled datasets and the unlabeled PI1M dataset, a collection of approximately one million virtual polymers generated via a recurrent neural network trained on the realistic polymers, we develop an ensemble of ML models, including Quantile Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptrons with dropout, Graph Neural Networks, and pretrained large language models. These models are coupled with diverse polymer representations such as Morgan, MACCS, RDKit, Topological, Atom Pair fingerprints, and graph-based descriptors to achieve property predictions, uncertainty estimations, model interpretability, and template-based polymerization synthesizability across a spectrum of properties, including gas permeability, thermal conductivity, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, fractional free volume, and density. The POINT$^{2}$ database can serve as a valuable resource for the polymer informatics community for polymer discovery and optimization.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art approach for many high-impact, real-world graph applications. For feature-rich graphs, a prevalent practice involves utilizing a PM directly to generate features, without incorporating any domain adaptation techniques. Nevertheless, this practice is suboptimal because the node features extracted from PM are graph-agnostic and prevent GNNs from fully utilizing the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features, leading to a decline in GNNs performance. In this work, we seek to improve the node features obtained from a PM for downstream graph tasks and introduce TOUCHUP-G, which has several advantages. It is (a) General: applicable to any downstream graph task, including link prediction which is often employed in recommender systems; (b) Multi-modal: able to improve raw features of any modality (e.g. images, texts, audio); (c) Principled: it is closely related to a novel metric, feature homophily, which we propose to quantify the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features and we show that TOUCHUP-G can effectively shrink the discrepancy between the graph structure and node features; (d) Effective: achieving state-of-the-art results on four real-world datasets spanning different tasks and modalities.</p></details> | SIGIR 2024 |

The objective is to find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while simultaneously minimizing the costs associated with the experts. Different definitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and algorithmic solutions. We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that captures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task coverage and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation variants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution methods. We show that solutions based on the QUBO formulations of TeamFormation problems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines. Furthermore, we show that QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks can effectively learn representations of experts and skills to enable transfer learning, allowing node embeddings from one problem instance to be efficiently applied to another.</p></details> |  |

GNNs have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, while differential equations provide a principled framework for modeling continuous dynamics across time and space. The intersection of these fields has led to innovative approaches that leverage the strengths of both, enabling applications in physics-informed learning, spatiotemporal modeling, and scientific computing. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the burgeoning research at the intersection of GNNs and DEs.

| **[Prediction of 30-day hospital readmission with clinical notes and EHR information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23050v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High hospital readmission rates are associated with significant costs and health risks for patients. Therefore, it is critical to develop predictive models that can support clinicians to determine whether or not a patient will return to the hospital in a relatively short period of time (e.g, 30-days). Nowadays, it is possible to collect both structured (electronic health records - EHR) and unstructured information (clinical notes) about a patient hospital event, all potentially containing relevant information for a predictive model. However, their integration is challenging. In this work we explore the combination of clinical notes and EHRs to predict 30-day hospital readmissions. We address the representation of the various types of information available in the EHR data, as well as exploring LLMs to characterize the clinical notes. We collect both information sources as the nodes of a graph neural network (GNN). Our model achieves an AUROC of 0.72 and a balanced accuracy of 66.7\%, highlighting the importance of combining the multimodal information.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADAGE: Active Defenses Against GNN Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00065v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance in various real-world applications, such as drug discovery, traffic states prediction, and recommendation systems. The fact that building powerful GNNs requires a large amount of training data, powerful computing resources, and human expertise turns the models into lucrative targets for model stealing attacks. Prior work has revealed that the threat vector of stealing attacks against GNNs is large and diverse, as an attacker can leverage various heterogeneous signals ranging from node labels to high-dimensional node embeddings to create a local copy of the target GNN at a fraction of the original training costs. This diversity in the threat vector renders the design of effective and general defenses challenging and existing defenses usually focus on one particular stealing setup. Additionally, they solely provide means to identify stolen model copies rather than preventing the attack. To close this gap, we propose the first and general Active Defense Against GNN Extraction (ADAGE). By analyzing the queries to the GNN, tracking their diversity in terms of proximity to different communities identified in the underlying graph, and increasing the defense strength with the growing fraction of communities that have been queried, ADAGE can prevent stealing in all common attack setups. Our extensive experimental evaluation using six benchmark datasets, four GNN models, and three types of adaptive attackers shows that ADAGE penalizes attackers to the degree of rendering stealing impossible, whilst not harming predictive performance for legitimate users. ADAGE, thereby, contributes towards securely sharing valuable GNNs in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Not a...</summary><p>Not all authors have given their explicit consent</p></details> |
| **[MIL vs. Aggregation: Evaluating Patient-Level Survival Prediction Strategies Using Graph-Based Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23042v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oncologists often rely on a multitude of data, including whole-slide images (WSIs), to guide therapeutic decisions, aiming for the best patient outcome. However, predicting the prognosis of cancer patients can be a challenging task due to tumor heterogeneity and intra-patient variability, and the complexity of analyzing WSIs. These images are extremely large, containing billions of pixels, making direct processing computationally expensive and requiring specialized methods to extract relevant information. Additionally, multiple WSIs from the same patient may capture different tumor regions, some being more informative than others. This raises a fundamental question: Should we use all WSIs to characterize the patient, or should we identify the most representative slide for prognosis? Our work seeks to answer this question by performing a comparison of various strategies for predicting survival at the WSI and patient level. The former treats each WSI as an independent sample, mimicking the strategy adopted in other works, while the latter comprises methods to either aggregate the predictions of the several WSIs or automatically identify the most relevant slide using multiple-instance learning (MIL). Additionally, we evaluate different Graph Neural Networks architectures under these strategies. We conduct our experiments using the MMIST-ccRCC dataset, which comprises patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Our results show that MIL-based selection improves accuracy, suggesting that choosing the most representative slide benefits survival prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[DP-GPL: Differentially Private Graph Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10544v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in various applications. Recently, graph prompt learning has emerged as a powerful GNN training paradigm, inspired by advances in language and vision foundation models. Here, a GNN is pre-trained on public data and then adapted to sensitive tasks using lightweight graph prompts. However, using prompts from sensitive data poses privacy risks. In this work, we are the first to investigate these practical risks in graph prompts by instantiating a membership inference attack that reveals significant privacy leakage. We also find that the standard privacy method, DP-SGD, fails to provide practical privacy-utility trade-offs in graph prompt learning, likely due to the small number of sensitive data points used to learn the prompts. As a solution, we propose DP-GPL for differentially private graph prompt learning based on the PATE framework, that generates a graph prompt with differential privacy guarantees. Our evaluation across various graph prompt learning methods, GNN architectures, and pre-training strategies demonstrates that our algorithm achieves high utility at strong privacy, effectively mitigating privacy concerns while preserving the powerful capabilities of prompted GNNs as powerful foundation models in the graph domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Not a...</summary><p>Not all authors have given their explicit consent</p></details> |
| **[AuditVotes: A Framework Towards More Deployable Certified Robustness for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22998v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), adaptive attacks continue to challenge their robustness. Certified robustness based on randomized smoothing has emerged as a promising solution, offering provable guarantees that a model's predictions remain stable under adversarial perturbations within a specified range. However, existing methods face a critical trade-off between accuracy and robustness, as achieving stronger robustness requires introducing greater noise into the input graph. This excessive randomization degrades data quality and disrupts prediction consistency, limiting the practical deployment of certifiably robust GNNs in real-world scenarios where both accuracy and robustness are essential. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{AuditVotes}, the first framework to achieve both high clean accuracy and certifiably robust accuracy for GNNs. It integrates randomized smoothing with two key components, \underline{au}gmentation and con\underline{dit}ional smoothing, aiming to improve data quality and prediction consistency. The augmentation, acting as a pre-processing step, de-noises the randomized graph, significantly improving data quality and clean accuracy. The conditional smoothing, serving as a post-processing step, employs a filtering function to selectively count votes, thereby filtering low-quality predictions and improving voting consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AuditVotes significantly enhances clean accuracy, certified robustness, and empirical robustness while maintaining high computational efficiency. Notably, compared to baseline randomized smoothing, AuditVotes improves clean accuracy by $437.1\%$ and certified accuracy by $409.3\%$ when the attacker can arbitrarily insert $20$ edges on the Cora-ML datasets, representing a substantial step toward deploying certifiably robust GNNs in real-world applications.</p></details> | 20 pages |

As opposed to frame-based cameras, the motion-dependent nature of event cameras presents persistent challenges in achieving robust event feature detection and matching. In recent years, learning-based approaches have demonstrated superior robustness over traditional handcrafted methods in feature detection and matching, particularly under aggressive motion and HDR scenarios. In this paper, we propose SuperEIO, a novel framework that leverages the learning-based event-only detection and IMU measurements to achieve event-inertial odometry. Our event-only feature detection employs a convolutional neural network under continuous event streams. Moreover, our system adopts the graph neural network to achieve event descriptor matching for loop closure. The proposed system utilizes TensorRT to accelerate the inference speed of deep networks, which ensures low-latency processing and robust real-time operation on resource-limited platforms. Besides, we evaluate our method extensively on multiple public datasets, demonstrating its superior accuracy and robustness compared to other state-of-the-art event-based methods. We have also open-sourced our pipeline to facilitate research in the field: https://github.com/arclab-hku/SuperEIO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Multi-Cancer Classification and Biomarker Identification, An Interpretable Multi-Omics Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22939v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of multi-omics data presents a major challenge in precision medicine, requiring advanced computational methods for accurate disease classification and biological interpretation. This study introduces the Multi-Omics Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (MOGKAN), a deep learning model that integrates messenger RNA, micro RNA sequences, and DNA methylation data with Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks for accurate and interpretable cancer classification across 31 cancer types. MOGKAN employs a hybrid approach combining differential expression with DESeq2, Linear Models for Microarray (LIMMA), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to reduce multi-omics data dimensionality while preserving relevant biological features. The model architecture is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem principle, using trainable univariate functions to enhance interpretability and feature analysis. MOGKAN achieves classification accuracy of 96.28 percent and demonstrates low experimental variability with a standard deviation that is reduced by 1.58 to 7.30 percents compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The biomarkers identified by MOGKAN have been validated as cancer-related markers through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. The proposed model presents an ability to uncover molecular oncogenesis mechanisms by detecting phosphoinositide-binding substances and regulating sphingolipid cellular processes. By integrating multi-omics data with graph-based deep learning, our proposed approach demonstrates superior predictive performance and interpretability that has the potential to enhance the translation of complex multi-omics data into clinically actionable cancer diagnostics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretability of Graph Neural Networks to Assess Effects of Global Change Drivers on Ecological Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15107v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pollinators play a crucial role for plant reproduction, either in natural ecosystem or in human-modified landscape. Global change drivers,including climate change or land use modifications, can alter the plant-pollinator interactions. To assess the potential influence of global change drivers on pollination, large-scale interactions, climate and land use data are required. While recent machine learning methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), allow the analysis of such datasets, interpreting their results can be challenging. We explore existing methods for interpreting GNNs in order to highlight the effects of various environmental covariates on pollination network connectivity. A large simulation study is performed to confirm whether these methods can detect the interactive effect between a covariate and a genus of plant on connectivity, and whether the application of debiasing techniques influences the estimation of these effects. An application on the Spipoll dataset, with and without accounting for sampling effects, highlights the potential impact of land use on network connectivity and shows that accounting for sampling effects partially alters the estimation of these effects.</p></details> |  |

Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |

We present a comparative analysis of three distinct methods for bias mitigation: data sparsification, feature modification, and synthetic data augmentation. Through experimental analysis using the german credit dataset, we evaluate these approaches using multiple fairness metrics, including statistical parity, equality of opportunity, and false positive rates. Our research demonstrates that while all methods improve fairness metrics compared to the original dataset, stratified sampling and synthetic data augmentation using GraphSAGE prove particularly effective in balancing demographic representation while maintaining model performance. The results provide practical insights for developing more equitable AI systems while maintaining model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Data Selection for Training Genomic Perturbation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14571v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based PerturbSeq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene expression models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Active learning methods are often employed to train these models due to the cost of the genomic experiments required to build the training set. However, poor model initialization in active learning can result in suboptimal early selections, wasting time and valuable resources. While typical active learning mitigates this issue over many iterations, the limited number of experimental cycles in genomic studies exacerbates the risk. To this end, we propose graph-based one-shot data selection methods for training gene expression models. Unlike active learning, one-shot data selection predefines the gene perturbations before training, hence removing the initialization bias. The data selection is motivated by theoretical studies of graph neural network generalization. The criteria are defined over the input graph and are optimized with submodular maximization. We compare them empirically to baselines and active learning methods that are state-of-the-art on this problem. The results demonstrate that graph-based one-shot data selection achieves comparable accuracy while alleviating the aforementioned risks.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Understanding and measuring these elements provides valuable insights into therapeutic processes and outcomes. However, automatic identification of these change principles from textual data remains challenging due to the nuanced and context-dependent nature of therapeutic dialogue. This paper introduces CFiCS, a hierarchical classification framework integrating graph machine learning with pretrained contextual embeddings. We represent common factors, intervention concepts, and microcounseling skills as a heterogeneous graph, where textual information from ClinicalBERT enriches each node. This structure captures both the hierarchical relationships (e.g., skill-level nodes linking to broad factors) and the semantic properties of therapeutic concepts. By leveraging graph neural networks, CFiCS learns inductive node embeddings that generalize to unseen text samples lacking explicit connections. Our results demonstrate that integrating ClinicalBERT node features and graph structure significantly improves classification performance, especially in fine-grained skill prediction. CFiCS achieves substantial gains in both micro and macro F1 scores across all tasks compared to baselines, including random forests, BERT-based multi-task models, and graph-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Invariant Control Strategies for Active Flow Control using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22775v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has gained traction for active flow control tasks, with initial applications exploring drag mitigation via flow field augmentation around a two-dimensional cylinder. RL has since been extended to more complex turbulent flows and has shown significant potential in learning complex control strategies. However, such applications remain computationally challenging due to its sample inefficiency and associated simulation costs. This fact is worsened by the lack of generalization capabilities of these trained policy networks, often being implicitly tied to the input configurations of their training conditions. In this work, we propose the use of graph neural networks to address this particular limitation, effectively increasing the range of applicability and getting more value out of the upfront RL training cost. GNNs can naturally process unstructured, threedimensional flow data, preserving spatial relationships without the constraints of a Cartesian grid. Additionally, they incorporate rotational, reflectional, and permutation invariance into the learned control policies, thus improving generalization and thereby removing the shortcomings of commonly used CNN or MLP architectures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we revisit the well-established two-dimensional cylinder benchmark problem for active flow control. The RL training is implemented using Relexi, a high-performance RL framework, with flow simulations conducted in parallel using the high-order discontinuous Galerkin framework FLEXI. Our results show that GNN-based control policies achieve comparable performance to existing methods while benefiting from improved generalization properties. This work establishes GNNs as a promising architecture for RL-based flow control and highlights the capabilities of Relexi and FLEXI for large-scale RL applications in fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven modeling of fluid flow around rotating structures with graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22252v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks, recently introduced into the field of fluid flow surrogate modeling, have been successfully applied to model the temporal evolution of various fluid flow systems. Existing applications, however, are mostly restricted to cases where the domain is time-invariant. The present work extends the application of graph neural network-based modeling to fluid flow around structures rotating with respect to a certain axis. Specifically, we propose to apply a graph neural network-based surrogate modeling for fluid flow with the mesh corotating with the structure. Unlike conventional data-driven approaches that rely on structured Cartesian meshes, our framework operates on unstructured co-rotating meshes, enforcing rotation equivariance of the learned model by leveraging co-rotating polar (2D) and cylindrical (3D) coordinate systems. To model the pressure for systems without Dirichlet pressure boundaries, we propose a novel local directed pressure difference formulation that is invariant to the reference pressure point and value. For flow systems with large mesh sizes, we introduce a scheme to train the network in single or distributed graphics processing units by accumulating the backpropagated gradients from partitions of the mesh. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is examined on two test cases: (i) fluid flow in a 2D rotating mixer, and (ii) the flow past a 3D rotating cube. Our results show that the model achieves stable and accurate rollouts for over 2000 time steps in periodic regimes while capturing accurate short-term dynamics in chaotic flow regimes. In addition, the drag and lift force predictions closely match the CFD calculations, highlighting the potential of the framework for modeling both periodic and chaotic fluid flow around rotating structures.</p></details> |  |

The rapid growth of social networks, such as Twitter (now rebranded as X), provides an unprecedented opportunity to analyze public opinion at scale without relying on traditional surveys. With the rise of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in modeling online opinion dynamics. Notably, classical opinion dynamics models, such as DeGroot, can be reformulated within a GNN framework. We introduce Latent Social Dynamical System (LSDS), a novel framework for modeling the latent dynamics of social media users' opinions based on textual content. Since expressed opinions may not fully reflect underlying beliefs, LSDS first encodes post content into latent representations. It then leverages a GraphODE framework, using a GNN-based ODE function to predict future opinions. A decoder subsequently utilizes these predicted latent opinions to perform downstream tasks, such as interaction prediction, which serve as benchmarks for model evaluation. Our framework is highly flexible, supporting various opinion dynamic models as ODE functions, provided they can be adapted into a GNN-based form. It also accommodates different encoder architectures and is compatible with diverse downstream tasks. To validate our approach, we constructed dynamic datasets from Twitter data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LSDS, highlighting its potential for future applications. We plan to publicly release our dataset and code upon the publication of this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>will ...</summary><p>will be submitted to a journal soon</p></details> |
| **[Few-Shot Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22097v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods for graph out-of-distribution (OOD) detection typically depend on training graph neural network (GNN) classifiers using a substantial amount of labeled in-distribution (ID) data. However, acquiring high-quality labeled nodes in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) is challenging and costly due to their complex textual and structural characteristics. Large language models (LLMs), known for their powerful zero-shot capabilities in textual tasks, show promise but struggle to naturally capture the critical structural information inherent to TAGs, limiting their direct effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-GOOD, a general framework that effectively combines the strengths of LLMs and GNNs to enhance data efficiency in graph OOD detection. Specifically, we first leverage LLMs' strong zero-shot capabilities to filter out likely OOD nodes, significantly reducing the human annotation burden. To minimize the usage and cost of the LLM, we employ it only to annotate a small subset of unlabeled nodes. We then train a lightweight GNN filter using these noisy labels, enabling efficient predictions of ID status for all other unlabeled nodes by leveraging both textual and structural information. After obtaining node embeddings from the GNN filter, we can apply informativeness-based methods to select the most valuable nodes for precise human annotation. Finally, we train the target ID classifier using these accurately annotated ID nodes. Extensive experiments on four real-world TAG datasets demonstrate that LLM-GOOD significantly reduces human annotation costs and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both ID classification accuracy and OOD detection performance.</p></details> |  |

Differentiating between pre-capillary and post-capillary PH is critical for guiding treatment decisions. This study develops and validates a deep learning-based diagnostic model for PH, designed to classify patients as non-PH, pre-capillary PH, or post-capillary PH. This retrospective study analyzed data from 204 patients (112 with pre-capillary PH, 32 with post-capillary PH, and 60 non-PH controls) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. Diagnoses were confirmed through right heart catheterization. We selected 6 samples from each category for the test set (18 samples, 10%), with the remaining 186 samples used for the training set. This process was repeated 35 times for testing. This paper proposes a deep learning model that combines Graph convolutional networks (GCN), Convolutional neural networks (CNN), and Transformers. The model was developed to process multimodal data, including short-axis (SAX) sequences, four-chamber (4CH) sequences, and clinical parameters. Our model achieved a performance of Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.81 +- 0.06(standard deviation) and Accuracy (ACC) = 0.73 +- 0.06 on the test set. The discriminative abilities were as follows: non-PH subjects (AUC = 0.74 +- 0.11), pre-capillary PH (AUC = 0.86 +- 0.06), and post-capillary PH (AUC = 0.83 +- 0.10). It has the potential to support clinical decision-making by effectively integrating multimodal data to assist physicians in making accurate and timely diagnoses.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph Sampling for Scalable and Expressive Graph Neural Networks on Homophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16593v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in many graph machine learning tasks but face challenges when scaling to large networks. GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian trace -- a proxy for the graph connectivity -- than random sampling, while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving Laplacian trace and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Equivariant Networks with Probabilistic Symmetry Breaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21985v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariance encodes known symmetries into neural networks, often enhancing generalization. However, equivariant networks cannot break symmetries: the output of an equivariant network must, by definition, have at least the same self-symmetries as the input. This poses an important problem, both (1) for prediction tasks on domains where self-symmetries are common, and (2) for generative models, which must break symmetries in order to reconstruct from highly symmetric latent spaces. This fundamental limitation can be addressed by considering equivariant conditional distributions, instead of equivariant functions. We present novel theoretical results that establish necessary and sufficient conditions for representing such distributions. Concretely, this representation provides a practical framework for breaking symmetries in any equivariant network via randomized canonicalization. Our method, SymPE (Symmetry-breaking Positional Encodings), admits a simple interpretation in terms of positional encodings. This approach expands the representational power of equivariant networks while retaining the inductive bias of symmetry, which we justify through generalization bounds. Experimental results demonstrate that SymPE significantly improves performance of group-equivariant and graph neural networks across diffusion models for graphs, graph autoencoders, and lattice spin system modeling.</p></details> | 28 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Comprehensive Benchmark for RNA 3D Structure-Function Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21681v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The RNA structure-function relationship has recently garnered significant attention within the deep learning community, promising to grow in importance as nucleic acid structure models advance. However, the absence of standardized and accessible benchmarks for deep learning on RNA 3D structures has impeded the development of models for RNA functional characteristics. In this work, we introduce a set of seven benchmarking datasets for RNA structure-function prediction, designed to address this gap. Our library builds on the established Python library rnaglib, and offers easy data distribution and encoding, splitters and evaluation methods, providing a convenient all-in-one framework for comparing models. Datasets are implemented in a fully modular and reproducible manner, facilitating for community contributions and customization. Finally, we provide initial baseline results for all tasks using a graph neural network. Source code: https://github.com/cgoliver/rnaglib Documentation: https://rnaglib.org</p></details> |  |
| **[GNNMerge: Merging of GNN Models Without Accessing Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03384v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging has gained prominence in machine learning as a method to integrate multiple trained models into a single model without accessing the original training data. While existing approaches have demonstrated success in domains such as computer vision and NLP, their application to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) remains unexplored. These methods often rely on the assumption of shared initialization, which is seldom applicable to GNNs. In this work, we undertake the first benchmarking study of model merging algorithms for GNNs, revealing their limited effectiveness in this context. To address these challenges, we propose GNNMerge, which utilizes a task-agnostic node embedding alignment strategy to merge GNNs. Furthermore, we establish that under a mild relaxation, the proposed optimization objective admits direct analytical solutions for widely used GNN architectures, significantly enhancing its computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations across diverse datasets, tasks, and architectures establish GNNMerge to be up to 24% more accurate than existing methods while delivering over 2 orders of magnitude speed-up compared to training from scratch.</p></details> |  |

To that end, we align the weights of different models layer-wise using optimal transport (OT). We present and evaluate three types of transportation costs and show that the studied fusion method consistently outperforms the performance of vanilla averaging. Finally, we present results suggesting that model fusion using OT is harder in the case of GCNs than MLPs and that incorporating the graph structure into the process does not improve the performance of the method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Cut-informed Graph Embedding and Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06635v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph clustering aims to divide the graph into different clusters. The recently emerging deep graph clustering approaches are largely built on graph neural networks (GNN). However, GNN is designed for general graph encoding and there is a common issue of representation collapse in existing GNN-based deep graph clustering algorithms. We attribute two main reasons for such issues: (i) the inductive bias of GNN models: GNNs tend to generate similar representations for proximal nodes. Since graphs often contain a non-negligible amount of inter-cluster links, the bias results in error message passing and leads to biased clustering; (ii) the clustering guided loss function: most traditional approaches strive to make all samples closer to pre-learned cluster centers, which causes a degenerate solution assigning all data points to a single label thus make all samples and less discriminative. To address these challenges, we investigate graph clustering from a graph cut perspective and propose an innovative and non-GNN-based Deep Cut-informed Graph embedding and Clustering framework, namely DCGC. This framework includes two modules: (i) cut-informed graph encoding; (ii) self-supervised graph clustering via optimal transport. For the encoding module, we derive a cut-informed graph embedding objective to fuse graph structure and attributes by minimizing their joint normalized cut. For the clustering module, we utilize the optimal transport theory to obtain the clustering assignments, which can balance the guidance of "proximity to the pre-learned cluster center". With the above two tailored designs, DCGC is more suitable for the graph clustering task, which can effectively alleviate the problem of representation collapse and achieve better performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method is simple but effective compared with benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CombiGCN: An effective GCN model for Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21471v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have opened up a potential line of research for collaborative filtering (CF). The key power of GNNs is based on injecting collaborative signal into user and item embeddings which will contain information about user-item interactions after that. However, there are still some unsatisfactory points for a CF model that GNNs could have done better. The way in which the collaborative signal are extracted through an implicit feedback matrix that is essentially built on top of the message-passing architecture of GNNs, and it only helps to update the embedding based on the value of the items (or users) embeddings neighboring. By identifying the similarity weight of users through their interaction history, a key concept of CF, we endeavor to build a user-user weighted connection graph based on their similarity weight. In this study, we propose a recommendation framework, CombiGCN, in which item embeddings are only linearly propagated on the user-item interaction graph, while user embeddings are propagated simultaneously on both the user-user weighted connection graph and user-item interaction graph graphs with Light Graph Convolution (LGC) and combined in a simpler method by using the weighted sum of the embeddings for each layer. We also conducted experiments comparing CombiGCN with several state-of-the-art models on three real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improvement Graph Convolution Collaborative Filtering with Weighted addition input](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21468v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks have been extensively applied in the field of machine learning to find features of graphs, and recommendation systems are no exception. The ratings of users on considered items can be represented by graphs which are input for many efficient models to find out the characteristics of the users and the items. From these insights, relevant items are recommended to users. However, user's decisions on the items have varying degrees of effects on different users, and this information should be learned so as not to be lost in the process of information mining. In this publication, we propose to build an additional graph showing the recommended weight of an item to a target user to improve the accuracy of GNN models. Although the users' friendships were not recorded, their correlation was still evident through the commonalities in consumption behavior. We build a model WiGCN (Weighted input GCN) to describe and experiment on well-known datasets. Conclusions will be stated after comparing our results with state-of-the-art such as GCMC, NGCF and LightGCN.

| **[Graph-to-Vision: Multi-graph Understanding and Reasoning using Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21435v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), as the dominant paradigm for graph-structured learning, have long faced dual challenges of exponentially escalating computational complexity and inadequate cross-scenario generalization capability. With the rapid advancement of multimodal learning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional cross-modal relational reasoning capabilities and generalization capacities, thereby opening up novel pathways for overcoming the inherent limitations of conventional graph learning paradigms. However, current research predominantly concentrates on investigating the single-graph reasoning capabilities of VLMs, which fundamentally fails to address the critical requirement for coordinated reasoning across multiple heterogeneous graph data in real-world application scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose the first multi-graph joint reasoning benchmark for VLMs. Our benchmark encompasses four graph categories: knowledge graphs, flowcharts, mind maps, and route maps,with each graph group accompanied by three progressively challenging instruction-response pairs. Leveraging this benchmark, we conducted comprehensive capability assessments of state-of-the-art VLMs and performed fine-tuning on open-source models. This study not only addresses the underexplored evaluation gap in multi-graph reasoning for VLMs but also empirically validates their generalization superiority in graph-structured learning.</p></details> |  |

We also show that the satisfiability problem is PSPACE-complete. These results bring together the promise of using standard logical methods for reasoning about GNNs and their properties, particularly in applications such as GNN querying, equivalence checking, etc. We prove that such natural problems can be solved in polynomial space.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2307.05150</p></details> |

However, traditional link-level volume estimation models are effective for motorized traffic but face significant challenges when applied to the bicycling context because of sparse data and the intricate nature of bicycling mobility patterns. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first study to utilize a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) architecture to model link-level bicycling volumes and systematically investigate the impact of varying levels of data sparsity (0%--99%) on model performance, simulating real-world scenarios. We have leveraged Strava Metro data as the primary source of bicycling counts across 15,933 road segments/links in the City of Melbourne, Australia. To evaluate the effectiveness of the GCN model, we benchmark it against traditional machine learning models, such as linear regression, support vector machines, and random forest. Our results show that the GCN model outperforms these traditional models in predicting Annual Average Daily Bicycle (AADB) counts, demonstrating its ability to capture the spatial dependencies inherent in bicycle traffic networks. While GCN remains robust up to 80% sparsity, its performance declines sharply beyond this threshold, highlighting the challenges of extreme data sparsity. These findings underscore the potential of GCNs in enhancing bicycling volume estimation, while also emphasizing the need for further research on methods to improve model resilience under high-sparsity conditions. Our findings offer valuable insights for city planners aiming to improve bicycling infrastructure and promote sustainable transportation.</p></details> |  |

Graph classification is a pivotal task in data mining with applications in social network analysis, web analysis, drug discovery, molecular property prediction, etc. Graph neural networks have achieved the state-of-the-art performance in graph classification, but they consistently struggle with overfitting. To mitigate overfitting, researchers have introduced various representation learning methods utilizing graph augmentation. However, existing methods rely on simplistic use of graph augmentation, which loses augmentation-induced differences and limits the expressiveness of representations. In this paper, we propose AugWard (Augmentation-Aware Training with Graph Distance and Consistency Regularization), a novel graph representation learning framework that carefully considers the diversity introduced by graph augmentation. AugWard applies augmentation-aware training to predict the graph distance between the augmented graph and its original one, aligning the representation difference directly with graph distance at both feature and structure levels. Furthermore, AugWard employs consistency regularization to encourage the classifier to handle richer representations. Experimental results show that AugWard gives the state-of-the-art performance in supervised, semi-supervised graph classification, and transfer learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PAKDD 2025 (Oral Presentation)</p></details> |

Most traditional multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) detection and tracking methods rely on 2D object detection, single-view multi-object tracking (MOT), and cross-view re-identification (ReID) techniques, without properly handling important 3D information by multi-view image aggregation. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection and tracking framework, named MCBLT, which first aggregates multi-view images with necessary camera calibration parameters to obtain 3D object detections in bird's-eye view (BEV). Then, we introduce hierarchical graph neural networks (GNNs) to track these 3D detections in BEV for MTMC tracking results. Unlike existing methods, MCBLT has impressive generalizability across different scenes and diverse camera settings, with exceptional capability for long-term association handling. As a result, our proposed MCBLT establishes a new state-of-the-art on the AICity'24 dataset with $81.22$ HOTA, and on the WildTrack dataset with $95.6$ IDF1.</p></details> |  |

This challenge becomes even more pronounced when attempting to generalize to structures that were not part of the training data.. In this work, we introduce SymGNN, a graph neural network architecture that leverages material symmetries to improve adsorption property prediction. By incorporating symmetry operations into the message-passing mechanism, our model enhances parameter sharing across different zeolite topologies, leading to improved generalization. We evaluate SymGNN on both interpolation and generalization tasks, demonstrating that it successfully captures key adsorption trends, including the influence of both the framework and aluminium distribution on CO$_2$ adsorption. Furthermore, we apply our model to the characterization of experimental adsorption isotherms, using a genetic algorithm to infer likely aluminium distributions. Our results highlight the effectiveness of machine learning models trained on simulations for studying real materials and suggest promising directions for fine-tuning with experimental data and generative approaches for the inverse design of multifunctional nanomaterials.</p></details> |  |

This approach leverages Graph-Instructed Neural Networks (GINNs) and sparse grids to address discontinuity detection also in domains of dimension larger than 3. GINNs, trained to identify troubled points on sparse grids, exploit graph structures built on the grids to achieve efficient and accurate discontinuity detection performances. We also introduce a recursive algorithm for general sparse grid-based detectors, characterized by convergence properties and easy applicability. Numerical experiments on functions with dimensions n = 2 and n = 4 demonstrate the efficiency and robust generalization properties of GINNs in detecting discontinuity interfaces. Notably, the trained GINNs offer portability and versatility, allowing integration into various algorithms and sharing among users.</p></details> |  |

However, their vulnerability to network perturbations poses a significant challenge. We propose $\beta$-GNN, a model enhancing GNN robustness without sacrificing clean data performance. $\beta$-GNN uses a weighted ensemble, combining any GNN with a multi-layer perceptron. A learned dynamic weight, $\beta$, modulates the GNN's contribution. This $\beta$ not only weights GNN influence but also indicates data perturbation levels, enabling proactive mitigation. Experimental results on diverse datasets show $\beta$-GNN's superior adversarial accuracy and attack severity quantification. Crucially, $\beta$-GNN avoids perturbation assumptions, preserving clean data structure and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the paper accepted at EuroMLSys 2025</p></details> |
| **[Valid Conformal Prediction for Dynamic GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19230v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graphs provide a flexible data abstraction for modelling many sorts of real-world systems, such as transport, trade, and social networks. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools allowing for different kinds of prediction and inference on these systems, but getting a handle on uncertainty, especially in dynamic settings, is a challenging problem. In this work we propose to use a dynamic graph representation known in the tensor literature as the unfolding, to achieve valid prediction sets via conformal prediction. This representation, a simple graph, can be input to any standard GNN and does not require any modification to existing GNN architectures or conformal prediction routines. One of our key contributions is a careful mathematical consideration of the different inference scenarios which can arise in a dynamic graph modelling context. For a range of practically relevant cases, we obtain valid prediction sets with almost no assumptions, even dispensing with exchangeability. In a more challenging scenario, which we call the semi-inductive regime, we achieve valid prediction under stronger assumptions, akin to stationarity. We provide real data examples demonstrating validity, showing improved accuracy over baselines, and sign-posting different failure modes which can occur when those assumptions are violated.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

However, training on such data requires large memory and extensive computations. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for efficient multiscale training of GNNs, designed to integrate information across multiscale representations of a graph. Our approach leverages a hierarchical graph representation, taking advantage of coarse graph scales in the training process, where each coarse scale graph has fewer nodes and edges. Based on this approach, we propose a suite of GNN training methods: such as coarse-to-fine, sub-to-full, and multiscale gradient computation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on various datasets and learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, comparing gene expression profiles between disease and control patients can deepen the understanding of disease pathology. Therefore, machine learning has been used to process gene expression data, with patient diagnosis emerging as one of the most popular applications. Although gene expression data can provide valuable insights, challenges arise because the number of patients in expression datasets is usually limited, and the data from different datasets with different gene expressions cannot be easily combined. This work proposes a novel methodology to address these challenges by integrating multiple gene expression datasets and domain-specific knowledge using knowledge graphs, a unique tool for biomedical data integration. Then, vector representations are produced using knowledge graph embedding techniques, which are used as inputs for a graph neural network and a multi-layer perceptron. We evaluate the efficacy of our methodology in three settings: single-dataset learning, multi-dataset learning, and transfer learning. The experimental results show that combining gene expression datasets and domain-specific knowledge improves patient diagnosis in all three settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Extended Semantic Web Conference 2025</p></details> |

Existing MIAs rely on prediction probability vectors, but they become ineffective when only prediction labels are available. We propose a Graph-level Label-Only Membership Inference Attack (GLO-MIA), which is based on the intuition that the target model's predictions on training data are more stable than those on testing data. GLO-MIA generates a set of perturbed graphs for target graph by adding perturbations to its effective features and queries the target model with the perturbed graphs to get their prediction labels, which are then used to calculate robustness score of the target graph. Finally, by comparing the robustness score with a predefined threshold, the membership of the target graph can be inferred correctly with high probability. Our evaluation on three datasets and four GNN models shows that GLO-MIA achieves an attack accuracy of up to 0.825, outperforming baseline work by 8.5% and closely matching the performance of probability-based MIAs, even with only prediction labels.</p></details> |  |

Collaborative filtering exploits similarities between users and items from historical data. However, it overlooks distinctive information, such as item names and descriptions. The semantic data of items should be further mined using models in the natural language processing field. Thus, items can be compared using text classification, similarity assessments, or identifying analogous sentence pairs. This research proposes combining two sources of item similarity signals: one from collaborative filtering and one from the semantic similarity measure between item names and descriptions. These signals are integrated into a graph convolutional neural network to optimize model weights, thereby providing accurate recommendations. Experiments are also designed to evaluate the contribution of each signal group to the recommendation results.</p></details> |  |

| **[Enhancing Causal Effect Estimation with Diffusion-Generated Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03630v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating causal effects from observational data is inherently challenging due to the lack of observable counterfactual outcomes and even the presence of unmeasured confounding. Traditional methods often rely on restrictive, untestable assumptions or necessitate valid instrumental variables, significantly limiting their applicability and robustness. In this paper, we introduce Augmented Causal Effect Estimation (ACEE), an innovative approach that utilizes synthetic data generated by a diffusion model to enhance causal effect estimation. By fine-tuning pre-trained generative models, ACEE simulates counterfactual scenarios that are otherwise unobservable, facilitating accurate estimation of individual and average treatment effects even under unmeasured confounding. Unlike conventional methods, ACEE relaxes the stringent unconfoundedness assumption, relying instead on an empirically checkable condition. Additionally, a bias-correction mechanism is introduced to mitigate synthetic data inaccuracies. We provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating the consistency and efficiency of the ACEE estimator, alongside comprehensive empirical validation through simulation studies and benchmark datasets. Results confirm that ACEE significantly improves causal estimation accuracy, particularly in complex settings characterized by nonlinear relationships and heteroscedastic noise.</p></details> |  |

For example, the Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID) uses embeddings from an InceptionV3 model pretrained to classify ImageNet. The effectiveness of this feature embedding model has considerable impact on the trustworthiness of the calculated metric (affecting its suitability in several domains, including medical imaging). Here, uncertainty quantification (UQ) is used to provide a heuristic measure of the trustworthiness of the feature embedding model and an FID-like metric called the Fr\'{e}chet Autoencoder Distance (FAED). We apply Monte Carlo dropout to a feature embedding model (convolutional autoencoder) to model the uncertainty in its embeddings. The distribution of embeddings for each input are then used to compute a distribution of FAED values. We express uncertainty as the predictive variance of the embeddings as well as the standard deviation of the computed FAED values. We find that their magnitude correlates with the extent to which the inputs are out-of-distribution to the model's training data, providing some validation of its ability to assess the trustworthiness of the FAED.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Diffusion Bridge with Attention-Based SAR Fusion for Satellite Image Cloud Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03607v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has achieved some success in addressing the challenge of cloud removal in optical satellite images, by fusing with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for cloud removal, delivering higher-quality estimation by sampling from cloud-free distributions, compared to earlier methods. However, diffusion models initiate sampling from pure Gaussian noise, which complicates the sampling trajectory and results in suboptimal performance. Also, current methods fall short in effectively fusing SAR and optical data. To address these limitations, we propose Diffusion Bridges for Cloud Removal, DB-CR, which directly bridges between the cloudy and cloud-free image distributions. In addition, we propose a novel multimodal diffusion bridge architecture with a two-branch backbone for multimodal image restoration, incorporating an efficient backbone and dedicated cross-modality fusion blocks to effectively extract and fuse features from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images. By formulating cloud removal as a diffusion-bridge problem and leveraging this tailored architecture, DB-CR achieves high-fidelity results while being computationally efficient. We evaluated DB-CR on the SEN12MS-CR cloud-removal dataset, demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Accelerated Rolling Diffusion, a novel framework for streaming gesture generation that extends rolling diffusion models with structured progressive noise scheduling, enabling seamless long-sequence motion synthesis while preserving realism and diversity. We further propose Rolling Diffusion Ladder Acceleration (RDLA), a new approach that restructures the noise schedule into a stepwise ladder, allowing multiple frames to be denoised simultaneously. This significantly improves sampling efficiency while maintaining motion consistency, achieving up to a 2x speedup with high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. We evaluate our approach on ZEGGS and BEAT, strong benchmarks for real-world applicability. Our framework is universally applicable to any diffusion-based gesture generation model, transforming it into a streaming approach. Applied to three state-of-the-art methods, it consistently outperforms them, demonstrating its effectiveness as a generalizable and efficient solution for real-time, high-fidelity co-speech gesture synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Existing work often overlooks the differences between humans and robots, producing unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we study how perfectly aligned human-robot pairs benefit robot learning. Capitalizing on VR-based teleportation, we introduce H\&R, a third-person dataset with 2,600 episodes, each of which captures the fine-grained correspondence between human hand and robot gripper. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models, we introduce Human2Robot, an end-to-end diffusion framework that formulates learning from human demonstration as a generative task. Human2Robot fully explores temporal dynamics in human videos to generate robot videos and predict actions at the same time. Through comprehensive evaluations of 4 carefully selected tasks in real-world settings, we demonstrate that Human2Robot can not only generate high-quality robot videos but also excels in seen tasks and generalizing to different positions, unseen appearances, novel instances, and even new backgrounds and task types.</p></details> |  |

Although broadly applicable, we focus on scientific computed tomography (CT) for experimental validation, where structured prior datasets are available, and reducing data requirements directly translates to shorter measurement times and lower X-ray doses. We first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model on domain-specific CT reconstructions. The diffusion model acts as a learned prior that is data-dependent and captures the structure of the underlying data distribution, which is then used in two ways: It drives the active learning process and also improves the quality of the reconstructions. During the active learning loop, we employ a variant of diffusion posterior sampling to generate conditional data samples from the posterior distribution, ensuring consistency with the current measurements. Using these samples, we quantify the uncertainty in the current estimate to select the most informative next measurement. Our results show substantial reductions in data acquisition requirements, corresponding to lower X-ray doses, while simultaneously improving image reconstruction quality across multiple real-world tomography datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[BUFF: Bayesian Uncertainty Guided Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Single Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03490v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super-resolution (SR) techniques are critical for enhancing image quality, particularly in scenarios where high-resolution imagery is essential yet limited by hardware constraints. Existing diffusion models for SR have relied predominantly on Gaussian models for noise generation, which often fall short when dealing with the complex and variable texture inherent in natural scenes. To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Bayesian Uncertainty Guided Diffusion Probabilistic Model (BUFF). BUFF distinguishes itself by incorporating a Bayesian network to generate high-resolution uncertainty masks. These masks guide the diffusion process, allowing for the adjustment of noise intensity in a manner that is both context-aware and adaptive. This novel approach not only enhances the fidelity of super-resolved images to their original high-resolution counterparts but also significantly mitigates artifacts and blurring in areas characterized by complex textures and fine details. The model demonstrates exceptional robustness against complex noise patterns and showcases superior adaptability in handling textures and edges within images. Empirical evidence, supported by visual results, illustrates the model's robustness, especially in challenging scenarios, and its effectiveness in addressing common SR issues such as blurring. Experimental evaluations conducted on the DIV2K dataset reveal that BUFF achieves a notable improvement, with a +0.61 increase compared to baseline in SSIM on BSD100, surpassing traditional diffusion approaches by an average additional +0.20dB PSNR gain. These findings underscore the potential of Bayesian methods in enhancing diffusion processes for SR, paving the way for future advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Previous studies have unveiled the roles of attention blocks in the U-Net. However, they overlook the dynamic evolution of their importance during the inference process, which hinders their further exploitation to improve image applications. In this study, we first theoretically proved that, re-weighting the outputs of the Transformer blocks within the U-Net is a "free lunch" for improving the signal-to-noise ratio during the sampling process. Next, we proposed Importance Probe to uncover and quantify the dynamic shifts in importance of the Transformer blocks throughout the denoising process. Finally, we design an adaptive importance-based re-weighting schedule tailored to specific image generation and editing tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the inference process, and enhances the aesthetic quality of the samples with identity consistency. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into any U-Net-based architecture.

| **[InterDyn: Controllable Interactive Dynamics with Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11785v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the dynamics of interacting objects is essential for both humans and intelligent systems. However, existing approaches are limited to simplified, toy settings and lack generalizability to complex, real-world environments. Recent advances in generative models have enabled the prediction of state transitions based on interventions, but focus on generating a single future state which neglects the continuous dynamics resulting from the interaction. To address this gap, we propose InterDyn, a novel framework that generates videos of interactive dynamics given an initial frame and a control signal encoding the motion of a driving object or actor. Our key insight is that large video generation models can act as both neural renderers and implicit physics ``simulators'', having learned interactive dynamics from large-scale video data. To effectively harness this capability, we introduce an interactive control mechanism that conditions the video generation process on the motion of the driving entity. Qualitative results demonstrate that InterDyn generates plausible, temporally consistent videos of complex object interactions while generalizing to unseen objects. Quantitative evaluations show that InterDyn outperforms baselines that focus on static state transitions. This work highlights the potential of leveraging video generative models as implicit physics engines. Project page: https://interdyn.is.tue.mpg.de/</p></details> |  |

Applications are numerous, ranging from virtual change rooms to the entertainment and gaming industry. This problem is challenging as garment dynamics influence geometric details such as wrinkling patterns, which depend on physical input including the wearer's body shape and motion, as well as cloth material features. Existing work studies learning-based modeling techniques to generate garment deformations from example data, and physics-inspired simulators to generate realistic garment dynamics. We propose here a learning-based approach trained on data generated with a physics-based simulator. Compared to prior work, our 3D generative model learns garment deformations for loose cloth geometry, especially for large deformations and dynamic wrinkles driven by body motion and cloth material. Furthermore, the model can be efficiently fitted to observations captured using vision sensors. We propose to leverage the capability of diffusion models to learn fine-scale detail: we model the 3D garment in a 2D parameter space, and learn a latent diffusion model using this representation independent from the mesh resolution. This allows to condition global and local geometric information with body and material information. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our method on both simulated data and data captured with a multi-view acquisition platform. Compared to strong baselines, our method is more accurate in terms of Chamfer distance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Conditioning Diffusions Using Malliavin Calculus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03461v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In stochastic optimal control and conditional generative modelling, a central computational task is to modify a reference diffusion process to maximise a given terminal-time reward. Most existing methods require this reward to be differentiable, using gradients to steer the diffusion towards favourable outcomes. However, in many practical settings, like diffusion bridges, the reward is singular, taking an infinite value if the target is hit and zero otherwise. We introduce a novel framework, based on Malliavin calculus and path-space integration by parts, that enables the development of methods robust to such singular rewards. This allows our approach to handle a broad range of applications, including classification, diffusion bridges, and conditioning without the need for artificial observational noise. We demonstrate that our approach offers stable and reliable training, outperforming existing techniques.</p></details> |  |

The fungus causes Asian rust and costs billions of US dollars every year for its control in South American soy production. Despite the regulatory measure that prohibits the cultivation of soybeans in some months of the year (soybean-free period) in Brazil, the presence of soybean production areas in neighboring countries, such as Paraguay and Bolivia, can help the survival of the pathogen between crop seasons. It is known that P. pachyrhizi urediniospores can be spread/transported thousands of kilometres by the wind. In this context, the objective of this work was to develop a mathematical model to simulate the atmospheric transport of P. pachyrhizi urediniospores from the west, Paraguay/Bolivia to Paran\'a Brazil, through storms coming from cold fronts. The transport of urediniospores was modeled by a diffusive-convective-reactive equation. Wind direction and the velocity of cold fronts that crossed Paran\'a state between October 2018 and February 2019 were used. For validation, real cases of rust occurrence in the Paran\'a state informed by the Anti-rust Consortium Portal in the season 2018/19 were used. The results confirm mathematically that urediniospores from infected areas located in a country on the west can be transported and deposited on the east, in the state of Paran\'a. The first case of soybean rust in Paran\'a state/Brazil was registered 10 days after the first cold front, suggesting that the transported and deposited urediniospores were still viable for host infection. This work reinforces the importance of the establishment of the soybean-free period in other soybean-producing countries. It will also provide a better understanding of the fungus dispersion system, potentially enabling the correct use of fungicides.</p></details> |  |
| **[Edge-SD-SR: Low Latency and Parameter Efficient On-device Super-Resolution with Stable Diffusion via Bidirectional Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06978v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been immense progress recently in the visual quality of Stable Diffusion-based Super Resolution (SD-SR). However, deploying large diffusion models on computationally restricted devices such as mobile phones remains impractical due to the large model size and high latency. This is compounded for SR as it often operates at high res (e.g. 4Kx3K). In this work, we introduce Edge-SD-SR, the first parameter efficient and low latency diffusion model for image super-resolution. Edge-SD-SR consists of ~169M parameters, including UNet, encoder and decoder, and has a complexity of only ~142 GFLOPs. To maintain a high visual quality on such low compute budget, we introduce a number of training strategies: (i) A novel conditioning mechanism on the low resolution input, coined bidirectional conditioning, which tailors the SD model for the SR task. (ii) Joint training of the UNet and encoder, while decoupling the encodings of the HR and LR images and using a dedicated schedule. (iii) Finetuning the decoder using the UNet's output to directly tailor the decoder to the latents obtained at inference time. Edge-SD-SR runs efficiently on device, e.g. it can upscale a 128x128 patch to 512x512 in 38 msec while running on a Samsung S24 DSP, and of a 512x512 to 2048x2048 (requiring 25 model evaluations) in just ~1.1 sec. Furthermore, we show that Edge-SD-SR matches or even outperforms state-of-the-art SR approaches on the most established SR benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

| **[End-to-end Learning of Sparse Interventions on Activations to Steer Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10679v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing use of generative models in daily life calls for efficient mechanisms to control their generation, to e.g., produce safe content or provide users with tools to explore style changes. Ideally, such mechanisms should be cheap, both at train and inference time, while preserving output quality. Recent research has shown that such mechanisms can be obtained by intervening exclusively on model activations, with the goal of correcting distributional differences between activations seen when using prompts from a source vs. a target set (e.g., toxic and non-toxic sentences). While cheap, these fast methods are inherently crude: their maps are tuned locally, not accounting for their impact on downstream layers, resulting in interventions that cause unintended shifts when used out-of-sample. We propose in this work linear end-to-end activation steering (LinEAS), an approach trained with a global loss that accounts simultaneously for all layerwise distributional shifts. In addition to being more robust, the loss used to train LinEAS can be regularized with sparsifying norms, which can automatically carry out neuron and layer selection. Empirically, LinEAS only requires a handful of samples to be effective, and beats similar baselines on toxicity mitigation, while performing on par with far more involved finetuning approaches. We show that LinEAS interventions can be composed, study the impact of sparsity on their performance, and showcase applications in text-to-image diffusions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minority-Focused Text-to-Image Generation via Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07838v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the generation of minority samples using pretrained text-to-image (T2I) latent diffusion models. Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for high-quality generation. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that encourages emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Extensive experiments conducted across various types of T2I models demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.

While previous studies have focused on the bottleneck layer (h-space), cross-attention, self-attention, and decoding layers, the overall role of the skip connections of the U-Net itself has not been specifically addressed. We conduct thorough analyses on the role of the skip connections and find that the residual connections passed by the third encoder block carry most of the spatial information of the reconstructed image, splitting the content from the style, passed by the remaining stream in the opposed decoding layer. We show that injecting the representations from this block can be used for text-based editing, precise modifications, and style transfer. We compare our method, SkipInject, to state-of-the-art style transfer and image editing methods and demonstrate that our method obtains the best content alignment and optimal structural preservation tradeoff.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR Workshop on AI for Creative Visual Content Generation Editing and Understanding 2025</p></details> |
| **[FaR: Enhancing Multi-Concept Text-to-Image Diffusion via Concept Fusion and Localized Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03292v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating multiple new concepts remains a challenging problem in the text-to-image task. Current methods often overfit when trained on a small number of samples and struggle with attribute leakage, particularly for class-similar subjects (e.g., two specific dogs). In this paper, we introduce Fuse-and-Refine (FaR), a novel approach that tackles these challenges through two key contributions: Concept Fusion technique and Localized Refinement loss function. Concept Fusion systematically augments the training data by separating reference subjects from backgrounds and recombining them into composite images to increase diversity. This augmentation technique tackles the overfitting problem by mitigating the narrow distribution of the limited training samples. In addition, Localized Refinement loss function is introduced to preserve subject representative attributes by aligning each concept's attention map to its correct region. This approach effectively prevents attribute leakage by ensuring that the diffusion model distinguishes similar subjects without mixing their attention maps during the denoising process. By fine-tuning specific modules at the same time, FaR balances the learning of new concepts with the retention of previously learned knowledge. Empirical results show that FaR not only prevents overfitting and attribute leakage while maintaining photorealism, but also outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent studies, which demonstrate that diffusion model, a prominent generative approach, can learn meaningful data representations that enhance predictive tasks, we explore the potential for developing a unified generative model in the molecular domain that effectively addresses both molecular generation and property prediction tasks. However, the integration of these tasks is challenging due to inherent inconsistencies, making simple multi-task learning ineffective. To address this, we propose UniGEM, the first unified model to successfully integrate molecular generation and property prediction, delivering superior performance in both tasks. Our key innovation lies in a novel two-phase generative process, where predictive tasks are activated in the later stages, after the molecular scaffold is formed. We further enhance task balance through innovative training strategies. Rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in both tasks. The principles behind UniGEM hold promise for broader applications, including natural language processing and computer vision.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches. The reader is urged to explore the results on our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

However, despite their capabilities, VDMs often fail to produce physically plausible videos due to an inherent lack of understanding of physics, resulting in incorrect dynamics and event sequences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel two-stage image-to-video generation framework that explicitly incorporates physics with vision and language informed physical prior. In the first stage, we employ a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a coarse-grained motion planner, integrating chain-of-thought and physics-aware reasoning to predict a rough motion trajectories/changes that approximate real-world physical dynamics while ensuring the inter-frame consistency. In the second stage, we use the predicted motion trajectories/changes to guide the video generation of a VDM. As the predicted motion trajectories/changes are rough, noise is added during inference to provide freedom to the VDM in generating motion with more fine details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can produce physically plausible motion, and comparative evaluations highlight the notable superiority of our approach over existing methods.

| **[Accurate stochastic simulation of nonlinear reactions between closest particles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03215v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a system of diffusing point particles in which any triplet of particles reacts and is removed from the system when the relative proximity of the constituent particles satisfies a predefined condition. Proximity-based reaction conditions of this kind are commonly used in particle-based simulations of chemical kinetics to mimic bimolecular reactions, those involving just two reactants, and have been extensively studied. The rate at which particles react within the system is determined by the reaction condition and particulate diffusion. In the bimolecular case, analytic relations exist between the reaction rate and the distance at which particles react allowing modellers to tune the rate of the reaction within their simulations by simply altering the reaction condition. However, generalising proximity-based reaction conditions to trimolecular reactions, those involving three particles, is more complicated because it requires understanding the distribution of the closest diffusing particle to a point in the vicinity of a spatially dependent absorbing boundary condition. We find that in this case the evolution of the system is described by a nonlinear partial integro-differential equation with no known analytic solution, which makes it difficult to relate the reaction rate to the reaction condition. To resolve this, we use singular perturbation theory to obtain a leading-order solution and show how to derive an approximate expression for the reaction rate. We then use finite element methods to quantify the higher-order corrections to this solution and the reaction rate, which are difficult to obtain analytically. Leveraging the insights gathered from this analysis, we demonstrate how to correct for the errors that arise from adopting the approximate expression for the reaction rate, enabling for the construction of more accurate particle-based simulations than previously possible.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |

However, most existing methods are typically limited to accepting control from a single primary modality, restricting their practical utility. To this end, we introduce \textbf{ACTalker}, an end-to-end video diffusion framework that supports both multi-signals control and single-signal control for talking head video generation. For multiple control, we design a parallel mamba structure with multiple branches, each utilizing a separate driving signal to control specific facial regions. A gate mechanism is applied across all branches, providing flexible control over video generation. To ensure natural coordination of the controlled video both temporally and spatially, we employ the mamba structure, which enables driving signals to manipulate feature tokens across both dimensions in each branch. Additionally, we introduce a mask-drop strategy that allows each driving signal to independently control its corresponding facial region within the mamba structure, preventing control conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces natural-looking facial videos driven by diverse signals and that the mamba layer seamlessly integrates multiple driving modalities without conflict.

However, solving the coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) in MFGs limits their applicability since solving coupled PDEs is computationally expensive. Additionally, modifying boundary conditions, such as the initial state distribution or terminal value function, necessitates extensive retraining, reducing scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a generalized framework, PIONM (Physics-Informed Neural Operator NF-MKV Net), which leverages physics-informed neural operators to solve MFGs equations. PIONM utilizes neural operators to compute MFGs equilibria for arbitrary boundary conditions. The method encodes boundary conditions as input features and trains the model to align them with density evolution, modeled using discrete-time normalizing flows. Once trained, the algorithm efficiently computes the density distribution at any time step for modified boundary condition, ensuring efficient adaptation to different boundary conditions in MFGs equilibria. Unlike traditional MFGs methods constrained by fixed coefficients, PIONM efficiently computes equilibria under varying boundary conditions, including obstacles, diffusion coefficients, initial densities, and terminal functions. PIONM can adapt to modified conditions while preserving density distribution constraints, demonstrating superior scalability and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

The effective restoration of these degraded images is critical for the subsequent vision tasks. While many existing approaches have successfully incorporated specific priors for individual tasks, these tailored solutions limit their applicability to other degradations. In this work, we propose a universal network architecture, dubbed ``ReviveDiff'', which can address various degradations and bring images back to life by enhancing and restoring their quality. Our approach is inspired by the observation that, unlike degradation caused by movement or electronic issues, quality degradation under adverse conditions primarily stems from natural media (such as fog, water, and low luminance), which generally preserves the original structures of objects. To restore the quality of such images, we leveraged the latest advancements in diffusion models and developed ReviveDiff to restore image quality from both macro and micro levels across some key factors determining image quality, such as sharpness, distortion, noise level, dynamic range, and color accuracy. We rigorously evaluated ReviveDiff on seven benchmark datasets covering five types of degrading conditions: Rainy, Underwater, Low-light, Smoke, and Nighttime Hazy. Our experimental results demonstrate that ReviveDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually.</p></details> |  |

However, their slow inference speed limits practical applications. Despite the development of various distillation techniques for diffusion models, we found that naive diffusion distillation methods do not yield satisfactory results. Distilled models exhibit reduced robustness with open-set input images and a decreased correlation between audio and video compared to teacher models, undermining the advantages of diffusion models. To address this, we propose FADA (Fast Diffusion Avatar Synthesis with Mixed-Supervised Multi-CFG Distillation). We first designed a mixed-supervised loss to leverage data of varying quality and enhance the overall model capability as well as robustness. Additionally, we propose a multi-CFG distillation with learnable tokens to utilize the correlation between audio and reference image conditions, reducing the threefold inference runs caused by multi-CFG with acceptable quality degradation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show that FADA generates vivid videos comparable to recent diffusion model-based methods while achieving an NFE speedup of 4.17-12.5 times.

Due to the limited control of audio signals in driving human motion, existing methods often add auxiliary spatial signals to stabilize movements, which may compromise the naturalness and freedom of motion. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end audio-only conditioned video diffusion model named Loopy. Specifically, we designed an inter- and intra-clip temporal module and an audio-to-latents module, enabling the model to leverage long-term motion information from the data to learn natural motion patterns and improving audio-portrait movement correlation. This method removes the need for manually specified spatial motion templates used in existing methods to constrain motion during inference. Extensive experiments show that Loopy outperforms recent audio-driven portrait diffusion models, delivering more lifelike and high-quality results across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 (Oral), Homepage: https://loopyavatar.github.io/</p></details> |

To address this, we propose GleSAM, which utilizes Generative Latent space Enhancement to boost robustness on low-quality images, thus enabling generalization across various image qualities. Specifically, we adapt the concept of latent diffusion to SAM-based segmentation frameworks and perform the generative diffusion process in the latent space of SAM to reconstruct high-quality representation, thereby improving segmentation. Additionally, we introduce two techniques to improve compatibility between the pre-trained diffusion model and the segmentation framework. Our method can be applied to pre-trained SAM and SAM2 with only minimal additional learnable parameters, allowing for efficient optimization. We also construct the LQSeg dataset with a greater diversity of degradation types and levels for training and evaluating the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GleSAM significantly improves segmentation robustness on complex degradations while maintaining generalization to clear images. Furthermore, GleSAM also performs well on unseen degradations, underscoring the versatility of our approach and dataset.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[One-Shot Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Local Model-Guided Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08870v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, One-shot Federated Learning methods based on Diffusion Models have garnered increasing attention due to their remarkable performance. However, most of these methods require the deployment of foundation models on client devices, which significantly raises the computational requirements and reduces their adaptability to heterogeneous client models compared to traditional FL methods. In this paper, we propose FedLMG, a heterogeneous one-shot Federated learning method with Local Model-Guided diffusion models. Briefly speaking, in FedLMG, clients do not need access to any foundation models but only train and upload their local models, which is consistent with traditional FL methods. On the clients, we employ classification loss and BN loss to capture the broad category features and detailed contextual features of the client distributions. On the server, based on the uploaded client models, we utilize backpropagation to guide the server's DM in generating synthetic datasets that comply with the client distributions, which are then used to train the aggregated model. By using the locally trained client models as a medium to transfer client knowledge, our method significantly reduces the computational requirements on client devices and effectively adapts to scenarios with heterogeneous clients. Extensive quantitation and visualization experiments on three large-scale real-world datasets, along with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that the synthetic datasets generated by FedLMG exhibit comparable quality and diversity to the client datasets, which leads to an aggregated model that outperforms all compared methods and even the performance ceiling, further elucidating the significant potential of utilizing DMs in FL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Reveals What to Cache: Profiling-Based Feature Reuse for Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03140v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video generation. However, the computational intensity remains a significant challenge for practical applications. While feature caching has been proposed to reduce the computational burden of diffusion models, existing methods typically overlook the heterogeneous significance of individual blocks, resulting in suboptimal reuse and degraded output quality. To this end, we address this gap by introducing ProfilingDiT, a novel adaptive caching strategy that explicitly disentangles foreground and background-focused blocks. Through a systematic analysis of attention distributions in diffusion models, we reveal a key observation: 1) Most layers exhibit a consistent preference for either foreground or background regions. 2) Predicted noise shows low inter-step similarity initially, which stabilizes as denoising progresses. This finding inspires us to formulate a selective caching strategy that preserves full computation for dynamic foreground elements while efficiently caching static background features. Our approach substantially reduces computational overhead while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant acceleration (e.g., 2.01 times speedup for Wan2.1) while maintaining visual fidelity across comprehensive quality metrics, establishing a viable method for efficient video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Model for Compressed Sensing MRI Across Undersampling Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16290v4)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compressed Sensing MRI reconstructs images of the body's internal anatomy from undersampled measurements, thereby reducing scan time. Recently, deep learning has shown great potential for reconstructing high-fidelity images from highly undersampled measurements. However, one needs to train multiple models for different undersampling patterns and desired output image resolutions, since most networks operate on a fixed discretization. Such approaches are highly impractical in clinical settings, where undersampling patterns and image resolutions are frequently changed to accommodate different real-time imaging and diagnostic requirements. We propose a unified MRI reconstruction model robust to various measurement undersampling patterns and image resolutions. Our approach uses neural operators, a discretization-agnostic architecture applied in both image and measurement spaces, to capture local and global features. Empirically, our model improves SSIM by 11% and PSNR by 4 dB over a state-of-the-art CNN (End-to-End VarNet), with 600$\times$ faster inference than diffusion methods. The resolution-agnostic design also enables zero-shot super-resolution and extended field-of-view reconstruction, offering a versatile and efficient solution for clinical MR imaging. Our unified model offers a versatile solution for MRI, adapting seamlessly to various measurement undersampling and imaging resolutions, making it highly effective for flexible and reliable clinical imaging.

Although various techniques have been developed to create robustness test suites, requirements-based testing for DNNs remains largely unexplored - yet such tests are recognized as an essential component of software validation of critical systems. In this work, we propose a requirements-based test suite generation method that uses structured natural language requirements formulated in a semantic feature space to create test suites by prompting text-conditional latent diffusion models with the requirement precondition and then using the associated postcondition to define a test oracle to judge outputs of the DNN under test. We investigate the approach using fine-tuned variants of pre-trained generative models. Our experiments on the MNIST, CelebA-HQ, ImageNet, and autonomous car driving datasets demonstrate that the generated test suites are realistic, diverse, consistent with preconditions, and capable of revealing faults.</p></details> |  |
| **[How I Warped Your Noise: a Temporally-Correlated Noise Prior for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03072v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video editing and generation methods often rely on pre-trained image-based diffusion models. During the diffusion process, however, the reliance on rudimentary noise sampling techniques that do not preserve correlations present in subsequent frames of a video is detrimental to the quality of the results. This either produces high-frequency flickering, or texture-sticking artifacts that are not amenable to post-processing. With this in mind, we propose a novel method for preserving temporal correlations in a sequence of noise samples. This approach is materialized by a novel noise representation, dubbed $\int$-noise (integral noise), that reinterprets individual noise samples as a continuously integrated noise field: pixel values do not represent discrete values, but are rather the integral of an underlying infinite-resolution noise over the pixel area. Additionally, we propose a carefully tailored transport method that uses $\int$-noise to accurately advect noise samples over a sequence of frames, maximizing the correlation between different frames while also preserving the noise properties. Our results demonstrate that the proposed $\int$-noise can be used for a variety of tasks, such as video restoration, surrogate rendering, and conditional video generation.

Building such a generalizable model is extremely challenging due to the lack of dataset, restricting existing image-based relighting models to a specific scenario (e.g., face or static human). To address this challenge, we repurpose a pre-trained diffusion model as a general image prior and jointly model the human relighting and background harmonization in the coarse-to-fine framework. To further enhance the temporal coherence of the relighting, we introduce an unsupervised temporal lighting model that learns the lighting cycle consistency from many real-world videos without any ground truth. In inference time, our temporal lighting module is combined with the diffusion models through the spatio-temporal feature blending algorithms without extra training; and we apply a new guided refinement as a post-processing to preserve the high-frequency details from the input image. In the experiments, Comprehensive Relighting shows a strong generalizability and lighting temporal coherence, outperforming existing image-based human relighting and harmonization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page:https://junyingw.github.io/paper/relighting.

However, it is difficult to collect large real-world visual datasets in this domain, in part due to privacy and expense constraints, which in turn presents significant challenges for training and deploying deep learning models. Existing in-bed human mesh estimation methods often rely heavily on real-world data, limiting their ability to generalize across different in-bed scenarios, such as varying coverings and environmental settings. To address this, we propose a Sim-to-Real Transfer Framework for in-bed human mesh recovery from overhead depth images, which leverages large-scale synthetic data alongside limited or no real-world samples. We introduce a diffusion model that bridges the gap between synthetic data and real data to support generalization in real-world in-bed pose and body inference scenarios. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness and adaptability across diverse healthcare scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 19 figures.

| **[Zero-Shot Image Restoration Using Few-Step Guidance of Consistency Models (and Beyond)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20596v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, it has become popular to tackle image restoration tasks with a single pretrained diffusion model (DM) and data-fidelity guidance, instead of training a dedicated deep neural network per task. However, such "zero-shot" restoration schemes currently require many Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) for performing well, which may be attributed to the many NFEs needed in the original generative functionality of the DMs. Recently, faster variants of DMs have been explored for image generation. These include Consistency Models (CMs), which can generate samples via a couple of NFEs. However, existing works that use guided CMs for restoration still require tens of NFEs or fine-tuning of the model per task that leads to performance drop if the assumptions during the fine-tuning are not accurate. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot restoration scheme that uses CMs and operates well with as little as 4 NFEs. It is based on a wise combination of several ingredients: better initialization, back-projection guidance, and above all a novel noise injection mechanism. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach for image super-resolution, deblurring and inpainting. Interestingly, we show that the usefulness of our noise injection technique goes beyond CMs: it can also mitigate the performance degradation of existing guided DM methods when reducing their NFE count.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (camera-ready).

| **[Concept Lancet: Image Editing with Compositional Representation Transplant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02828v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are widely used for image editing tasks. Existing editing methods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an edit direction in the text embedding or score space. However, such a procedure faces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual consistency while underestimating it fails the editing task. Notably, each source image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to search for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error. To address this challenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play framework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image editing. At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text embedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the representations of the collected visual concepts. This allows us to accurately estimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit. Based on the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept transplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction. To sufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation dataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of visual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary. Experiments on multiple diffusion-based image editing baselines show that methods equipped with CoLan achieve state-of-the-art performance in editing effectiveness and consistency preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025.

| **[F-ViTA: Foundation Model Guided Visible to Thermal Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02801v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thermal imaging is crucial for scene understanding, particularly in low-light and nighttime conditions. However, collecting large thermal datasets is costly and labor-intensive due to the specialized equipment required for infrared image capture. To address this challenge, researchers have explored visible-to-thermal image translation. Most existing methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Diffusion Models (DMs), treating the task as a style transfer problem. As a result, these approaches attempt to learn both the modality distribution shift and underlying physical principles from limited training data. In this paper, we propose F-ViTA, a novel approach that leverages the general world knowledge embedded in foundation models to guide the diffusion process for improved translation. Specifically, we condition an InstructPix2Pix Diffusion Model with zero-shot masks and labels from foundation models such as SAM and Grounded DINO. This allows the model to learn meaningful correlations between scene objects and their thermal signatures in infrared imagery. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that F-ViTA outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, our model generalizes well to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and can generate Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR), Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR), and Near-Infrared (NIR) translations from the same visible image.

| **[Quantum Generative Models for Image Generation: Insights from MNIST and MedMNIST](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00034v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum generative models offer a promising new direction in machine learning by leveraging quantum circuits to enhance data generation capabilities. In this study, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical image generation framework that integrates variational quantum circuits into a diffusion-based model. To improve training dynamics and generation quality, we introduce two novel noise strategies: intrinsic quantum-generated noise and a tailored noise scheduling mechanism. Our method is built upon a lightweight U-Net architecture, with the quantum layer embedded in the bottleneck module to isolate its effect. We evaluate our model on MNIST and MedMNIST datasets to examine its feasibility and performance. Notably, our results reveal that under limited data conditions (fewer than 100 training images), the quantum-enhanced model generates images with higher perceptual quality and distributional similarity than its classical counterpart using the same architecture. While the quantum model shows advantages on grayscale data such as MNIST, its performance is more nuanced on complex, color-rich datasets like PathMNIST. These findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of quantum generative models and lay the groundwork for future developments in low-resource and biomedical image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified World Models: Coupling Video and Action Diffusion for Pretraining on Large Robotic Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02792v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building generalist robots. However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation required for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

This technical report presents the first-look evaluation benchmark (named GPT-ImgEval), quantitatively and qualitatively diagnosing GPT-4o's performance across three critical dimensions: (1) generation quality, (2) editing proficiency, and (3) world knowledge-informed semantic synthesis. Across all three tasks, GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both image generation control and output quality, while also showcasing exceptional knowledge reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, based on the GPT-4o's generated data, we propose a classification-model-based approach to investigate the underlying architecture of GPT-4o, where our empirical results suggest the model consists of an auto-regressive (AR) combined with a diffusion-based head for image decoding, rather than the VAR-like architectures. We also provide a complete speculation on GPT-4o's overall architecture. In addition, we conduct a series of analyses to identify and visualize GPT-4o's specific limitations and the synthetic artifacts commonly observed in its image generation. We also present a comparative study of multi-round image editing between GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, and discuss the safety implications of GPT-4o's outputs, particularly their detectability by existing image forensic models. We hope that our work can offer valuable insight and provide a reliable benchmark to guide future research, foster reproducibility, and accelerate innovation in the field of image generation and beyond.

| **[Scene Splatter: Momentum 3D Scene Generation from Single Image with Video Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02764v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Scene Splatter, a momentum-based paradigm for video diffusion to generate generic scenes from single image. Existing methods, which employ video generation models to synthesize novel views, suffer from limited video length and scene inconsistency, leading to artifacts and distortions during further reconstruction. To address this issue, we construct noisy samples from original features as momentum to enhance video details and maintain scene consistency. However, for latent features with the perception field that spans both known and unknown regions, such latent-level momentum restricts the generative ability of video diffusion in unknown regions. Therefore, we further introduce the aforementioned consistent video as a pixel-level momentum to a directly generated video without momentum for better recovery of unseen regions. Our cascaded momentum enables video diffusion models to generate both high-fidelity and consistent novel views. We further finetune the global Gaussian representations with enhanced frames and render new frames for momentum update in the next step. In this manner, we can iteratively recover a 3D scene, avoiding the limitation of video length. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization capability and superior performance of our method in high-fidelity and consistent scene generation.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Specifically, MD-ProjTex fuses noise predictions from multiple views at each diffusion step and jointly updates the per-view denoising directions to maintain 3D consistency. In contrast to existing state-of-the-art methods that rely on optimization or sequential view synthesis, MD-ProjTex is computationally more efficient and achieves better quantitative and qualitative results.</p></details> |  |

Existing unified models have struggled to simultaneously handle the three fundamental capabilities in a unified model: understanding, generation, and editing. Models like Chameleon and EMU3 utilize VQGAN for image discretization, due to the lack of deep semantic interaction, they lag behind specialist models like LLaVA in visual understanding tasks. To mitigate this, LaViT and ILLUME employ semantic encoders for tokenization, but they struggle with image editing due to poor texture preservation. Meanwhile, Janus series decouples the input and output image representation, limiting their abilities to seamlessly handle interleaved image-text understanding and generation. In contrast, ILLUME+ introduces a unified dual visual tokenizer, DualViTok, which preserves both fine-grained textures and text-aligned semantics while enabling a coarse-to-fine image representation strategy for multimodal understanding and generation. Additionally, we employ a diffusion model as the image detokenizer for enhanced generation quality and efficient super-resolution. ILLUME+ follows a continuous-input, discrete-output scheme within the unified MLLM and adopts a progressive training procedure that supports dynamic resolution across the vision tokenizer, MLLM, and diffusion decoder. This design allows for flexible and efficient context-aware image editing and generation across diverse tasks. ILLUME+ (3B) exhibits competitive performance against existing unified MLLMs and specialized models across multimodal understanding, generation, and editing benchmarks. With its strong performance, ILLUME+ provides a scalable and versatile foundation for future multimodal applications. Project Page: https://illume-unified-mllm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose to create autonomous interactive robots, by training a model to imitate operator data. Our model is trained on a dataset of human-robot interactions, where an expert operator is asked to vary the interactions and mood of the robot, while the operator commands as well as the pose of the human and robot are recorded. Our approach learns to predict continuous operator commands through a diffusion process and discrete commands through a classifier, all unified within a single transformer architecture. We evaluate the resulting model in simulation and with a user study on the real system. We show that our method enables simple autonomous human-robot interactions that are comparable to the expert-operator baseline, and that users can recognize the different robot moods as generated by our model. Finally, we demonstrate a zero-shot transfer of our model onto a different robotic platform with the same operator interface.</p></details> |  |

Our main focus is on the properties of the mean-field limit and, in particular, on the nonuniqueness of stationary states. By extending classical bifurcation analysis to include multichromatic interaction potentials and random graph structures, we explicitly identify bifurcation points and relate them to the eigenvalues of the graphon integral operator. Furthermore, we characterize the resulting McKean-Vlasov PDE as a gradient flow with respect to a suitable metric. We combine these theoretical results with the spectral analysis of the linearized McKean-Vlasov operator and extensive numerical simulations to gain insight into the stability and long-term behaviour of stationary solutions. In addition, we provide strong evidence that (minus) the interaction energy of the interacting particle system serves as a natural order parameter. In particular, beyond the transition point and for multichromatic interactions, we observe an energy cascade that is strongly linked to the dynamical metastability of the system.</p></details> | 28 pages, 4 figures |

We propose a diffusion transformer (DiT) based framework, DreamActor-M1, with hybrid guidance to overcome these limitations. For motion guidance, our hybrid control signals that integrate implicit facial representations, 3D head spheres, and 3D body skeletons achieve robust control of facial expressions and body movements, while producing expressive and identity-preserving animations. For scale adaptation, to handle various body poses and image scales ranging from portraits to full-body views, we employ a progressive training strategy using data with varying resolutions and scales. For appearance guidance, we integrate motion patterns from sequential frames with complementary visual references, ensuring long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions during complex movements. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works, delivering expressive results for portraits, upper-body, and full-body generation with robust long-term consistency.

By constructing adjacency matrices, the proposed method enables the transformation of text watermarks into robust image-based representations, providing a novel multi-modal watermarking paradigm for image generation applications. Additionally, this study presents a newly designed image restoration module to mitigate image degradation caused by transmission losses and various noise interferences, thereby ensuring the reliability and integrity of the watermark. Experimental results validate the robustness of the method under multiple noise attacks, providing a secure, scalable, and efficient solution for digital image copyright protection.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion-based models produce high-quality images, their extensive denoising steps result in significant computational overhead, limiting real-world applicability. Visual autoregressive~(VAR) models, which predict next-scale tokens rather than spatially adjacent ones, offer significantly faster inference suitable for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose the first VAR-based approach for subject-driven generation. However, na\"{\i}ve fine-tuning VAR leads to computational overhead, language drift, and reduced diversity. To address these challenges, we introduce selective layer tuning to reduce complexity and prior distillation to mitigate language drift. Additionally, we found that the early stages have a greater influence on the generation of subject than the latter stages, which merely synthesize local details. Based on this finding, we propose scale-wise weighted tuning, which prioritizes coarser resolutions for promoting the model to focus on the subject-relevant information instead of local details. Extensive experiments validate that our method significantly outperforms diffusion-based baselines across various metrics and demonstrates its practical usage.</p></details> |  |

Conventional methods have developed specialized solutions (e.g., geometry regularization or feed-forward deterministic model) to mitigate the issue. However, they still suffer from performance degradation by minimal overlap across input views with insufficient visual information. Fortunately, recent video generative models show promise in addressing this challenge as they are capable of generating video clips with plausible 3D structures. Powered by large pretrained video diffusion models, some pioneering research start to explore the potential of video generative prior and create 3D scenes from sparse views. Despite impressive improvements, they are limited by slow inference time and the lack of 3D constraint, leading to inefficiencies and reconstruction artifacts that do not align with real-world geometry structure. In this paper, we propose VideoScene to distill the video diffusion model to generate 3D scenes in one step, aiming to build an efficient and effective tool to bridge the gap from video to 3D. Specifically, we design a 3D-aware leap flow distillation strategy to leap over time-consuming redundant information and train a dynamic denoising policy network to adaptively determine the optimal leap timestep during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VideoScene achieves faster and superior 3D scene generation results than previous video diffusion models, highlighting its potential as an efficient tool for future video to 3D applications.

Another limitation is the absence of text-guided makeup try-on, which is more user-friendly without needing reference images. In this study, we make the first attempt to use a single model for various makeup tasks. Specifically, we formulate different makeup tasks as cross-domain translations and leverage a cross-domain diffusion model to accomplish all tasks. Unlike existing methods that rely on separate encoder-decoder configurations or cycle-based mechanisms, we propose using different domain embeddings to facilitate domain control. This allows for seamless domain switching by merely changing embeddings with a single model, thereby reducing the reliance on additional modules for different tasks. Moreover, to support precise text-to-makeup applications, we introduce the MT-Text dataset by extending the MT dataset with textual annotations, advancing the practicality of makeup technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://basiclab.github.io/MAD</p></details> |
| **[A Bias-Free Training Paradigm for More General AI-generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17671v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Successful forensic detectors can produce excellent results in supervised learning benchmarks but struggle to transfer to real-world applications. We believe this limitation is largely due to inadequate training data quality. While most research focuses on developing new algorithms, less attention is given to training data selection, despite evidence that performance can be strongly impacted by spurious correlations such as content, format, or resolution. A well-designed forensic detector should detect generator specific artifacts rather than reflect data biases. To this end, we propose B-Free, a bias-free training paradigm, where fake images are generated from real ones using the conditioning procedure of stable diffusion models. This ensures semantic alignment between real and fake images, allowing any differences to stem solely from the subtle artifacts introduced by AI generation. Through content-based augmentation, we show significant improvements in both generalization and robustness over state-of-the-art detectors and more calibrated results across 27 different generative models, including recent releases, like FLUX and Stable Diffusion 3.5. Our findings emphasize the importance of a careful dataset design, highlighting the need for further research on this topic.

| **[SkyReels-A2: Compose Anything in Video Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02436v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents SkyReels-A2, a controllable video generation framework capable of assembling arbitrary visual elements (e.g., characters, objects, backgrounds) into synthesized videos based on textual prompts while maintaining strict consistency with reference images for each element. We term this task elements-to-video (E2V), whose primary challenges lie in preserving the fidelity of each reference element, ensuring coherent composition of the scene, and achieving natural outputs. To address these, we first design a comprehensive data pipeline to construct prompt-reference-video triplets for model training. Next, we propose a novel image-text joint embedding model to inject multi-element representations into the generative process, balancing element-specific consistency with global coherence and text alignment. We also optimize the inference pipeline for both speed and output stability. Moreover, we introduce a carefully curated benchmark for systematic evaluation, i.e, A2 Bench. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate diverse, high-quality videos with precise element control. SkyReels-A2 is the first open-source commercial grade model for the generation of E2V, performing favorably against advanced closed-source commercial models. We anticipate SkyReels-A2 will advance creative applications such as drama and virtual e-commerce, pushing the boundaries of controllable video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniTalker: Real-Time Text-Driven Talking Head Generation with In-Context Audio-Visual Style Replication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02433v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in talking head generation, owing to its potential to revolutionize the human-AI interaction from text interfaces into realistic video chats. However, research on text-driven talking heads remains underexplored, with existing methods predominantly adopting a cascaded pipeline that combines TTS systems with audio-driven talking head models. This conventional pipeline not only introduces system complexity and latency overhead but also fundamentally suffers from asynchronous audiovisual output and stylistic discrepancies between generated speech and visual expressions. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniTalker, an end-to-end unified framework that simultaneously generates synchronized speech and talking head videos from text and reference video in real-time zero-shot scenarios, while preserving both speech style and facial styles. The framework employs a dual-branch diffusion transformer architecture: the audio branch synthesizes mel-spectrograms from text, while the visual branch predicts fine-grained head poses and facial dynamics. To bridge modalities, we introduce a novel audio-visual fusion module that integrates cross-modal information to ensure temporal synchronization and stylistic coherence between audio and visual outputs. Furthermore, our in-context reference learning module effectively captures both speech and facial style characteristics from a single reference video without introducing an extra style extracting module. To the best of our knowledge, OmniTalker presents the first unified framework that jointly models speech style and facial style in a zero-shot setting, achieving real-time inference speed of 25 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in generation quality, particularly excelling in style preservation and audio-video synchronization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page https://humanaigc.github.io/omnitalker</p></details> |
| **[CFG-Zero*: Improved Classifier-Free Guidance for Flow Matching Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18886v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely adopted technique in diffusion/flow models to improve image fidelity and controllability. In this work, we first analytically study the effect of CFG on flow matching models trained on Gaussian mixtures where the ground-truth flow can be derived. We observe that in the early stages of training, when the flow estimation is inaccurate, CFG directs samples toward incorrect trajectories. Building on this observation, we propose CFG-Zero*, an improved CFG with two contributions: (a) optimized scale, where a scalar is optimized to correct for the inaccuracies in the estimated velocity, hence the * in the name; and (b) zero-init, which involves zeroing out the first few steps of the ODE solver. Experiments on both text-to-image (Lumina-Next, Stable Diffusion 3, and Flux) and text-to-video (Wan-2.1) generation demonstrate that CFG-Zero* consistently outperforms CFG, highlighting its effectiveness in guiding Flow Matching models.

| **[Translation of Fetal Brain Ultrasound Images into Pseudo-MRI Images using Artificial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02408v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultrasound is a widely accessible and cost-effective medical imaging tool commonly used for prenatal evaluation of the fetal brain. However, it has limitations, particularly in the third trimester, where the complexity of the fetal brain requires high image quality for extracting quantitative data. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers superior image quality and tissue differentiation but is less available, expensive, and requires time-consuming acquisition. Thus, transforming ultrasonic images into an MRI-mimicking display may be advantageous and allow better tissue anatomy presentation. To address this goal, we have examined the use of artificial intelligence, implementing a diffusion model renowned for generating high-quality images. The proposed method, termed "Dual Diffusion Imposed Correlation" (DDIC), leverages a diffusion-based translation methodology, assuming a shared latent space between ultrasound and MRI domains. Model training was obtained utilizing the "HC18" dataset for ultrasound and the "CRL fetal brain atlas" along with the "FeTA " datasets for MRI. The generated pseudo-MRI images provide notable improvements in visual discrimination of brain tissue, especially in the lateral ventricles and the Sylvian fissure, characterized by enhanced contrast clarity. Improvement was demonstrated in Mutual information, Peak signal-to-noise ratio, Fr\'echet Inception Distance, and Contrast-to-noise ratio. Findings from these evaluations indicate statistically significant superior performance of the DDIC compared to other translation methodologies. In addition, a Medical Opinion Test was obtained from 5 gynecologists. The results demonstrated display improvement in 81% of the tested images. In conclusion, the presented pseudo-MRI images hold the potential for streamlining diagnosis and enhancing clinical outcomes through improved representation.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Modeling Emotional Dynamics in Social Networks: Uncovering the Positive Role of Information Cocoons in Group Emotional Stabilization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16295v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information cocooning-amplified by algorithmic filtering-poses complex challenges for emotional dynamics in online social networks. This study explores how algorithmically reinforced information cocooning shapes information diffusion and group emotional dynamics in online social networks. We propose a viewpoint-based network evolution model that simulates struc-tural transformations driven by user preferences. To model the hidden influence of personalized comment recommendations, we introduce the Hidden Comment Area Cocoon (H-CAC)-a novel higher-order structure that captures cocooning at the comment level. This structure is integrated into an emotion spreading mod-el, enabling the quantification of how cocooning affects collective sentiment. By defining Recommendation Accuracy (RA) as a tunable parameter, we systematically evaluate its impact on emo-tional volatility and polarization. Extensive simulations, validated with real-world data, reveal that while cocooning reduces content diversity, it can significantly enhance emotional resilience within groups. Our findings offer a new computational lens on the dual role of cocooning and provide actionable insights for designing emotionally stable, algorithmically governed social platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free Dense-Aligned Diffusion Guidance for Modular Conditional Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01515v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional image synthesis is a crucial task with broad applications, such as artistic creation and virtual reality. However, current generative methods are often task-oriented with a narrow scope, handling a restricted condition with constrained applicability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that treats conditional image synthesis as the modular combination of diverse fundamental condition units. Specifically, we divide conditions into three primary units: text, layout, and drag. To enable effective control over these conditions, we design a dedicated alignment module for each. For the text condition, we introduce a Dense Concept Alignment (DCA) module, which achieves dense visual-text alignment by drawing on diverse textual concepts. For the layout condition, we propose a Dense Geometry Alignment (DGA) module to enforce comprehensive geometric constraints that preserve the spatial configuration. For the drag condition, we introduce a Dense Motion Alignment (DMA) module to apply multi-level motion regularization, ensuring that each pixel follows its desired trajectory without visual artifacts. By flexibly inserting and combining these alignment modules, our framework enhances the model's adaptability to diverse conditional generation tasks and greatly expands its application range. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our framework across a variety of conditions, including textual description, segmentation mask (bounding box), drag manipulation, and their combinations.

| **[Nonisotropic Gaussian Diffusion for Realistic 3D Human Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06035v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic human motion prediction aims to forecast multiple possible future movements from past observations. While current approaches report high diversity and realism, they often generate motions with undetected limb stretching and jitter. To address this, we introduce SkeletonDiffusion, a latent diffusion model that embeds an explicit inductive bias on the human body within its architecture and training. Our model is trained with a novel nonisotropic Gaussian diffusion formulation that aligns with the natural kinematic structure of the human skeleton. Results show that our approach outperforms conventional isotropic alternatives, consistently generating realistic predictions while avoiding artifacts such as limb distortion. Additionally, we identify a limitation in commonly used diversity metrics, which may inadvertently favor models that produce inconsistent limb lengths within the same sequence. SkeletonDiffusion sets a new benchmark on real-world datasets, outperforming various baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

| **[Marine Saliency Segmenter: Object-Focused Conditional Diffusion with Region-Level Semantic Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02391v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marine Saliency Segmentation (MSS) plays a pivotal role in various vision-based marine exploration tasks. However, existing marine segmentation techniques face the dilemma of object mislocalization and imprecise boundaries due to the complex underwater environment. Meanwhile, despite the impressive performance of diffusion models in visual segmentation, there remains potential to further leverage contextual semantics to enhance feature learning of region-level salient objects, thereby improving segmentation outcomes. Building on this insight, we propose DiffMSS, a novel marine saliency segmenter based on the diffusion model, which utilizes semantic knowledge distillation to guide the segmentation of marine salient objects. Specifically, we design a region-word similarity matching mechanism to identify salient terms at the word level from the text descriptions. These high-level semantic features guide the conditional feature learning network in generating salient and accurate diffusion conditions with semantic knowledge distillation. To further refine the segmentation of fine-grained structures in unique marine organisms, we develop the dedicated consensus deterministic sampling to suppress overconfident missegmentations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DiffMSS over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p></details> |  |
