In this study, we systematically explore the non-oxidative glycolysis metabolic network, guided by the principle that reactions with negative Gibbs free energy differences are thermodynamically favored. We enumerate alternative pathways that implement the net non-oxidative glycolysis reaction, categorized by their length. Our analysis reveals several alternative thermodynamically favorable pathways beyond those reported in experiments. In addition, we identify molecules within the network, such as 3-hydroxypropionic acid, that may have significant potential for further investigation.</p></details> | 10 figures, 6 tables |
| **[A standard transformer and attention with linear biases for molecular conformer generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19834v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling low-energy molecular conformations, spatial arrangements of atoms in a molecule, is a critical task for many different calculations performed in the drug discovery and optimization process. Numerous specialized equivariant networks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D molecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as a viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve generalization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models require a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this paper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively addresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating relative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million parameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model with 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative positional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with the shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different attention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional encoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to serve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular conformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revision of paper at OpenReview: https://openreview.net/forum?id=BjjerMYL3F</p></details> |
| **[Complete polyhedral description of chemical graphs of maximum degree at most 3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19768v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical graphs are simple undirected connected graphs, where vertices represent atoms in a molecule and edges represent chemical bonds. A degree-based topological index is a molecular descriptor used to study specific physicochemical properties of molecules. Such an index is computed from the sum of the weights of the edges of a chemical graph, each edge having a weight defined by a formula that depends only on the degrees of its endpoints. Given any degree-based topological index and given two integers $n$ and $m$, we are interested in determining chemical graphs of order $n$ and size $m$ that maximize or minimize the index. Focusing on chemical graphs with maximum degree at most 3, we show that this reduces to determining the extreme points of a polytope that contains at most 10 facets. We also show that the number of extreme points is at most 16, which means that for any given $n$ and $m$, there are very few different classes of extremal graphs, independently of the chosen degree-based topological index.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[Q2SAR: A Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning Approach for Drug Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14920v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a cornerstone of computational drug discovery. This research demonstrates the successful application of a Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning (QMKL) framework to enhance QSAR classification, showing a notable performance improvement over classical methods. We apply this methodology to a dataset for identifying DYRK1A kinase inhibitors. The workflow involves converting SMILES representations into numerical molecular descriptors, reducing dimensionality via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on an optimized combination of multiple quantum and classical kernels. By benchmarking the QMKL-SVM against a classical Gradient Boosting model, we show that the quantum-enhanced approach achieves a superior AUC score, highlighting its potential to provide a quantum advantage in challenging cheminformatics classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Genome-Anchored Foundation Model Embeddings Improve Molecular Prediction from Histology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19681v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precision oncology requires accurate molecular insights, yet obtaining these directly from genomics is costly and time-consuming for broad clinical use. Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover, PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs. By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations, PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for wider clinical application.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Operator Forces For Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19628v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations extend the length and time scale of atomistic simulations by replacing groups of correlated atoms with CG beads. Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a promising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular dynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on force matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with corresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference atomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields which recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local distortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this work, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that substantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global conformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing that flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from configurational samples.</p></details> |  |

| **[Controlled Generation with Equivariant Variational Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18340v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models, or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Bad Molecules: Are MLLMs Ready for Structure-Level Molecular Detoxification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10912v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure. Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sampling 3D Molecular Conformers with Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15378v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative modeling of molecular structures.

| **[Reimagining Target-Aware Molecular Generation through Retrieval-Enhanced Aligned Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14488v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Breakthroughs in high-accuracy protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have established receptor-based molecule design as a critical driver for rapid early-phase drug discovery. However, most approaches still struggle to balance pocket-specific geometric fit with strict valence and synthetic constraints. To resolve this trade-off, a Retrieval-Enhanced Aligned Diffusion termed READ is introduced, which is the first to merge molecular Retrieval-Augmented Generation with an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model. Specifically, a contrastively pre-trained encoder aligns atom-level representations during training, then retrieves graph embeddings of pocket-matched scaffolds to guide each reverse-diffusion step at inference. This single mechanism can inject real-world chemical priors exactly where needed, producing valid, diverse, and shape-complementary ligands. Experimental results demonstrate that READ can achieve very competitive performance in CBGBench, surpassing state-of-the-art generative models and even native ligands. That suggests retrieval and diffusion can be co-optimized for faster, more reliable structure-based drug design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Rao-Blackwell Gradient Estimators for Equivariant Denoising Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09890v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In domains such as molecular and protein generation, physical systems exhibit inherent symmetries that are critical to model. Two main strategies have emerged for learning invariant distributions: designing equivariant network architectures and using data augmentation to approximate equivariance. While equivariant architectures preserve symmetry by design, they often involve greater complexity and pose optimization challenges. Data augmentation, on the other hand, offers flexibility but may fall short in fully capturing symmetries. Our framework enhances both approaches by reducing training variance and providing a provably lower-variance gradient estimator. We achieve this by interpreting data augmentation as a Monte Carlo estimator of the training gradient and applying Rao-Blackwellization. This leads to more stable optimization, faster convergence, and reduced variance, all while requiring only a single forward and backward pass per sample. We also present a practical implementation of this estimator incorporating the loss and sampling procedure through a method we call Orbit Diffusion. Theoretically, we guarantee that our loss admits equivariant minimizers. Empirically, Orbit Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art results on GEOM-QM9 for molecular conformation generation, improves crystal structure prediction, and advances text-guided crystal generation on the Perov-5 and MP-20 benchmarks. Additionally, it enhances protein designability in protein structure generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Representation Condition Improves Equivariant Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03655v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in molecular generative models have demonstrated great promise for accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often struggle to generate high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to improve molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared with single-stage generation, the easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second stage generation toward a high-quality molecule in a goal-oriented way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 50\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations. Furthermore, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly reducing the generation iterations needed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 as a Spotlight Poster</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Graph Neural Networks for Robustness in Olfaction Sensors and Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00455v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines with vision-language models (VLMs) This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and the training data of VLMs, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors which emulate human olfactory recognition through electronic sensor arrays. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to the challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chemical Language Model Linker: blending text and molecules with modular adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20182v3)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models and multi-modal models has enabled the appealing idea of generating novel molecules from text descriptions. Generative modeling would shift the paradigm from relying on large-scale chemical screening to find molecules with desired properties to directly generating those molecules. However, multi-modal models combining text and molecules are often trained from scratch, without leveraging existing high-quality pretrained models. Training from scratch consumes more computational resources and prohibits model scaling. In contrast, we propose a lightweight adapter-based strategy named Chemical Language Model Linker (ChemLML). ChemLML blends the two single domain models and obtains conditional molecular generation from text descriptions while still operating in the specialized embedding spaces of the molecular domain. ChemLML can tailor diverse pretrained text models for molecule generation by training relatively few adapter parameters. We find that the choice of molecular representation used within ChemLML, SMILES versus SELFIES, has a strong influence on conditional molecular generation performance. SMILES is often preferable despite not guaranteeing valid molecules. We raise issues in using the entire PubChem dataset of molecules and their associated descriptions for evaluating molecule generation and provide a filtered version of the dataset as a generation test set. To demonstrate how ChemLML could be used in practice, we generate candidate protein inhibitors and use docking to assess their quality and also generate candidate membrane permeable molecules.</p></details> | 63 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Diffusion-Free Graph Generation with Next-Scale Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23612v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models excel in efficiency and plug directly into the transformer ecosystem, delivering robust generalization, predictable scalability, and seamless workflows such as fine-tuning and parallelized training. However, they require an explicit sequence order, which contradicts the unordered nature of graphs. In contrast, diffusion models maintain permutation invariance and enable one-shot generation but require up to thousands of denoising steps and additional features for expressivity, leading to high computational costs. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in image generation, especially the success of visual autoregressive methods, we propose MAG, a novel diffusion-free graph generation framework based on next-scale prediction. By leveraging a hierarchy of latent representations, the model progressively generates scales of the entire graph without the need for explicit node ordering. Experiments on both generic and molecular graph datasets demonstrated the potential of this method, achieving inference speedups of up to three orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art methods, while preserving high-quality generation.</p></details> | Camera-ready version |
| **[Pretraining Generative Flow Networks with Inexpensive Rewards for Molecular Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06337v4)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have recently emerged as a suitable framework for generating diverse and high-quality molecular structures by learning from rewards treated as unnormalized distributions. Previous works in this framework often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on a subset of ZINC dataset, and by employing robust evaluation metrics we show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods for a wide range of drug design tasks.

| **[Towards Unified and Lossless Latent Space for 3D Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15567v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality. On GEOM-Drugs, it reduces FCD by 72.6\% over the previous best result, while achieving over 70\% relative average improvements in geometric fidelity.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learning-aided Bigraph Matching Approach to Multi-Crew Restoration of Damaged Power Networks Coupled with Road Transportation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19703v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions, such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained. Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes, depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power restored.</p></details> | IDETC 2025 |
| **[Higher-Order Graph Databases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19661v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in graph databases (GDBs) have been driving interest in large-scale analytics, yet current systems fail to support higher-order (HO) interactions beyond first-order (one-hop) relations, which are crucial for tasks such as subgraph counting, polyadic modeling, and HO graph learning. We address this by introducing a new class of systems, higher-order graph databases (HO-GDBs) that use lifting and lowering paradigms to seamlessly extend traditional GDBs with HO. We provide a theoretical analysis of OLTP and OLAP queries, ensuring correctness, scalability, and ACID compliance. We implement a lightweight, modular, and parallelizable HO-GDB prototype that offers native support for hypergraphs, node-tuples, subgraphs, and other HO structures under a unified API. The prototype scales to large HO OLTP & OLAP workloads and shows how HO improves analytical tasks, for example enhancing accuracy of graph neural networks within a GDB by 44%. Our work ensures low latency and high query throughput, and generalizes both ACID-compliant and eventually consistent systems.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce HeNCler-a novel approach for Heterophilous Node Clustering. HeNCler learns a similarity graph by optimizing a clustering-specific objective based on weighted kernel singular value decomposition. Our approach enables spectral clustering on an asymmetric similarity graph, providing flexibility for both directed and undirected graphs. By solving the primal problem directly, our method overcomes the computational difficulties of traditional adjacency partitioning-based approaches. Experimental results show that HeNCler significantly improves node clustering performance in heterophilous graph settings, highlighting the advantage of its asymmetric graph-learning framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN 2025), Special Session on Neural Network for Graphs and Beyond</p></details> |
| **[Fast and Distributed Equivariant Graph Neural Networks by Virtual Node Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19482v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse scientific applications. However, existing approaches face critical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and suffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified for computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for large-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered graph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and aggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual distinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual and real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables FastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale sparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN, a distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between subgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically reducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our models across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein dynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark (113,000 nodes). Results demonstrate superior efficiency and performance, establishing new capabilities in large-scale equivariant graph learning.

| **[Uncertainty Quantification on Graph Learning: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14642v3)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical models have demonstrated their exceptional capabilities across numerous applications, such as social networks, citation networks, and online recommendation systems. However, their performance, confidence, and trustworthiness are often limited by the inherent randomness in data and the challenges of accurately modeling real-world complexities. There has been increased interest in developing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques tailored to graphical models. In this survey, we comprehensively examine existing works on UQ for graphical models, focusing on key aspects such as the sources, representation, handling, and evaluation of uncertainty. This survey distinguishes itself from most existing UQ surveys by specifically concentrating on UQ in graphical models, including probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). After reviewing sources of uncertainty, we organize the work using two high-level dimensions: uncertainty representation and uncertainty handling. By offering a comprehensive overview of the current landscape, including both established methodologies and emerging trends, we aim to bridge gaps in understanding key challenges and opportunities in UQ for graphical models, hoping to inspire researchers working on graphical models or uncertainty quantification to make further advancements at the cross of the two fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Extreme Operating Condition Search for Online Relay Setting Calculation in Renewable Power Systems Based on Parallel Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19289v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem is one of the key problems in relay setting calculation, which is used to ensure that the setting values of protection relays can adapt to the changing operating conditions of power systems over a period of time after deployment. The high penetration of renewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the operating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the adoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy. However, the computation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration, heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency requirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead, this paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS method suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system information is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a topological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph distance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model for feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each node are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to predict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed PGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems, where some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation units. The nonlinear fault characteristics of renewables are fully considered when computing fault currents. The experiment results show that the proposed PGNN method achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods in solving the EOCS problem.

However, Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches often disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss. This discontinuity not only deteriorates temporal modeling but also hinders optimization by increasing the difficulty of parameter convergence. Our theoretical study quantifies this through a Lipschitz upper bound, showing that large batch sizes enlarge the parameter search space. In response, we propose BADGNN, a novel batch-agnostic framework consisting of two core components: (1) Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space expansion, and (2) Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to alleviate attention distortion induced by both regularization and batching. Empirical results on three benchmark datasets show that BADGNN maintains strong performance while enabling significantly larger batch sizes and faster training compared to TGN.

In this work, we use graph neural networks to investigate \emph{quiver mutation} -- an operation that transforms one quiver (or directed multigraph) into another -- which is central to the theory of cluster algebras with deep connections to geometry, topology, and physics. In the study of cluster algebras, the question of \emph{mutation equivalence} is of fundamental concern: given two quivers, can one efficiently determine if one quiver can be transformed into the other through a sequence of mutations? In this paper, we use graph neural networks and AI explainability techniques to independently discover mutation equivalence criteria for quivers of type $\tilde{D}$. Along the way, we also show that even without explicit training to do so, our model captures structure within its hidden representation that allows us to reconstruct known criteria from type $D$, adding to the growing evidence that modern machine learning models are capable of learning abstract and parsimonious rules from mathematical data.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Automating Traffic Monitoring with SHM Sensor Networks via Vision-Supervised Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19023v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation. To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast State-Augmented Learning for Wireless Resource Allocation with Dual Variable Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18748v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider resource allocation problems in multi-user wireless networks, where the goal is to optimize a network-wide utility function subject to constraints on the ergodic average performance of users. We demonstrate how a state-augmented graph neural network (GNN) parametrization for the resource allocation policy circumvents the drawbacks of the ubiquitous dual subgradient methods by representing the network configurations (or states) as graphs and viewing dual variables as dynamic inputs to the model, viewed as graph signals supported over the graphs. Lagrangian maximizing state-augmented policies are learned during the offline training phase, and the dual variables evolve through gradient updates while executing the learned state-augmented policies during the inference phase. Our main contributions are to illustrate how near-optimal initialization of dual multipliers for faster inference can be accomplished with dual variable regression, leveraging a secondary GNN parametrization, and how maximization of the Lagrangian over the multipliers sampled from the dual descent dynamics substantially improves the training of state-augmented models. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm with extensive numerical experiments in a case study of transmit power control. Finally, we prove a convergence result and an exponential probability bound on the excursions of the dual function (iterate) optimality gaps.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TSP for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[SaGIF: Improving Individual Fairness in Graph Neural Networks via Similarity Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18696v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual fairness (IF) in graph neural networks (GNNs), which emphasizes the need for similar individuals should receive similar outcomes from GNNs, has been a critical issue. Despite its importance, research in this area has been largely unexplored in terms of (1) a clear understanding of what induces individual unfairness in GNNs and (2) a comprehensive consideration of identifying similar individuals. To bridge these gaps, we conduct a preliminary analysis to explore the underlying reason for individual unfairness and observe correlations between IF and similarity consistency, a concept introduced to evaluate the discrepancy in identifying similar individuals based on graph structure versus node features. Inspired by our observations, we introduce two metrics to assess individual similarity from two distinct perspectives: topology fusion and feature fusion. Building upon these metrics, we propose Similarity-aware GNNs for Individual Fairness, named SaGIF. The key insight behind SaGIF is the integration of individual similarities by independently learning similarity representations, leading to an improvement of IF in GNNs. Our experiments on several real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed metrics and SaGIF. Specifically, SaGIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IF methods while maintaining utility performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/ZzoomD/SaGIF.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Federated Learning from Molecules to Processes: A Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18525v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a perspective on federated learning in chemical engineering that envisions collaborative efforts in machine learning (ML) developments within the chemical industry. Large amounts of chemical and process data are proprietary to chemical companies and are therefore locked in data silos, hindering the training of ML models on large data sets in chemical engineering. Recently, the concept of federated learning has gained increasing attention in ML research, enabling organizations to jointly train machine learning models without disclosure of their individual data. We discuss potential applications of federated learning in several fields of chemical engineering, from the molecular to the process scale. In addition, we apply federated learning in two exemplary case studies that simulate practical scenarios of multiple chemical companies holding proprietary data sets: (i) prediction of binary mixture activity coefficients with graph neural networks and (ii) system identification of a distillation column with autoencoders. Our results indicate that ML models jointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy than models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform similarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies. Federated learning has therefore great potential to advance ML models in chemical engineering while respecting corporate data privacy, making it promising for future industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17064v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (main text), 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Your Token Becomes Worthless: Unveiling Rug Pull Schemes in Crypto Token via Code-and-Transaction Fusion Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18398v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rug pull scams have emerged as a persistent threat to cryptocurrency, causing significant financial losses. A typical scenario involves scammers deploying honeypot contracts to attract investments, restricting token sales, and draining the funds, which leaves investors with worthless tokens. Current methods either rely on predefined patterns to detect code risks or utilize statistical transaction data to train detection models. However, real-world Rug Pull schemes often involve a complex interplay between malicious code and suspicious transaction behaviors. These methods, which solely focus on one aspect, fall short in detecting such schemes effectively. In this paper, we propose RPhunter, a novel technique that integrates code and transaction for Rug Pull detection. First, RPhunter establishes declarative rules and performs flow analysis to extract code risk information, further constructing a semantic risk code graph (SRCG). Meanwhile, to leverage transaction information, RPhunter formulates dynamic token transaction activities as a token flow behavior graph (TFBG) in which nodes and edges are characterized from network structure and market manipulation perspectives. Finally, RPhunter employs graph neural networks to extract complementary features from SRCG and TFBG, integrating them through an attention fusion model to enhance the detection of Rug Pull. We manually analyzed 645 Rug Pull incidents from code and transaction aspects and constructed a ground-truth dataset. We evaluated RPhunter on our dataset, achieving a precision of 95.3%, a recall of 93.8% and an F1 score of 94.5%, which highlights superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, when applied to the real-world scenarios, RPhunter has identified 4801 Rug Pull tokens, achieving a precision of 91%.</p></details> |  |
| **[PERSCEN: Learning Personalized Interaction Pattern and Scenario Preference for Multi-Scenario Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18382v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the expansion of business scales and scopes on online platforms, multi-scenario matching has become a mainstream solution to reduce maintenance costs and alleviate data sparsity. The key to effective multi-scenario recommendation lies in capturing both user preferences shared across all scenarios and scenario-aware preferences specific to each scenario. However, existing methods often overlook user-specific modeling, limiting the generation of personalized user representations. To address this, we propose PERSCEN, an innovative approach that incorporates user-specific modeling into multi-scenario matching. PERSCEN constructs a user-specific feature graph based on user characteristics and employs a lightweight graph neural network to capture higher-order interaction patterns, enabling personalized extraction of preferences shared across scenarios. Additionally, we leverage vector quantization techniques to distil scenario-aware preferences from users' behavior sequence within individual scenarios, facilitating user-specific and scenario-aware preference modeling. To enhance efficient and flexible information transfer, we introduce a progressive scenario-aware gated linear unit that allows fine-grained, low-latency fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PERSCEN outperforms existing methods. Further efficiency analysis confirms that PERSCEN effectively balances performance with computational cost, ensuring its practicality for real-world industrial systems.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

In this work, we explore how robots equipped with electronic skin can recognize tactile gestures and interpret them as human commands. We developed a modular robot E-skin, composed of multiple irregularly shaped skin patches, which can be assembled to cover the robot's body while capturing real-time pressure and pose data from thousands of sensing points. To process this information, we propose an equivariant graph neural network-based recognizer that efficiently and accurately classifies diverse tactile gestures, including poke, grab, stroke, and double-pat. By mapping the recognized gestures to predefined robot actions, we enable intuitive human-robot interaction purely through tactile input.</p></details> |  |
| **[Call Me Maybe: Enhancing JavaScript Call Graph Construction using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18191v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis plays a key role in finding bugs, including security issues. A critical step in static analysis is building accurate call graphs that model function calls in a program. However, due to hard-to-analyze language features, existing call graph construction algorithms for JavaScript are neither sound nor complete. Prior work shows that even advanced solutions produce false edges and miss valid ones. In this work, we assist these tools by identifying missed call edges. Our main idea is to frame the problem as link prediction on full program graphs, using a rich representation with multiple edge types. Our approach, GRAPHIA, leverages recent advances in graph neural networks to model non-local relationships between code elements. Concretely, we propose representing JavaScript programs using a combination of syntactic- and semantic-based edges. GRAPHIA can learn from imperfect labels, including static call edges from existing tools and dynamic edges from tests, either from the same or different projects. Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine learning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by ranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges (150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M structural and 386K semantic edges. It ranks the correct target as the top candidate in over 42% of unresolved cases and within the top 5 in 72% of cases, reducing the manual effort needed for analysis. Our results show that learning-based methods can improve the recall of JavaScript call graph construction. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply GNN-based link prediction to full multi-file program graphs for interprocedural analysis.</p></details> |  |

For non-Euclidean data, e.g., graphs, that particularly involves topological structures, one important aspect neglected by prior studies is how machine learning models generalize under topological shifts. This paper proposes Advective Diffusion Transformer (AdvDIFFormer), a physics-inspired graph Transformer model designed to address this challenge. The model is derived from advective diffusion equations which describe a class of continuous message passing process with observed and latent topological structures. We show that AdvDIFFormer has provable capability for controlling generalization error with topological shifts, which in contrast cannot be guaranteed by graph diffusion models, i.e., the generalized formulation of common graph neural networks in continuous space. Empirically, the model demonstrates superiority in various predictive tasks across information networks, molecular screening and protein interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

Current rumor detection methods primarily rely on propagation graphs to improve the model performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often compromised by noisy and irrelevant structures in the propagation process. To tackle this issue, techniques such as weight adjustment and data augmentation have been proposed. However, they depend heavily on rich original propagation structures, limiting their effectiveness in handling rumors that lack sufficient propagation information, especially in the early stages of dissemination. In this work, we introduce the Key Propagation Graph Generator (KPG), a novel reinforcement learning-based framework, that generates contextually coherent and informative propagation patterns for events with insufficient topology information and identifies significant substructures in events with redundant and noisy propagation structures. KPG comprises two key components: the Candidate Response Generator (CRG) and the Ending Node Selector (ENS). CRG learns latent variable distributions from refined propagation patterns to eliminate noise and generate new candidates for ENS, while ENS identifies the most influential substructures in propagation graphs and provides training data for CRG. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end framework that utilizes rewards derived from a pre-trained graph neural network to guide the training process. The resulting key propagation graphs are then employed in downstream rumor detection tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that KPG outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/radial-attention</p></details> |

Traditional motion synthesis methods are either restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view, multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution for category-agnostic 3D animation.

| **[GenHSI: Controllable Generation of Human-Scene Interaction Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19840v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes (storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images. We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training. Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible human-scene interaction from a single image scene.

| **[Improving Progressive Generation with Decomposable Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19839v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions, add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid). As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution. Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://snap-research.github.io/dfm/</p></details> |

However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage available at https://simplegvr.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Machine Learning with Privacy for Protected Attributes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19836v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy (DP) has become the standard for private data analysis. Certain machine learning applications only require privacy protection for specific protected attributes. Using naive variants of differential privacy in such use cases can result in unnecessary degradation of utility. In this work, we refine the definition of DP to create a more general and flexible framework that we call feature differential privacy (FDP). Our definition is simulation-based and allows for both addition/removal and replacement variants of privacy, and can handle arbitrary and adaptive separation of protected and non-protected features. We prove the properties of FDP, such as adaptive composition, and demonstrate its implications for limiting attribute inference attacks. We also propose a modification of the standard DP-SGD algorithm that satisfies FDP while leveraging desirable properties such as amplification via sub-sampling. We apply our framework to various machine learning tasks and show that it can significantly improve the utility of DP-trained models when public features are available. For example, we train diffusion models on the AFHQ dataset of animal faces and observe a drastic improvement in FID compared to DP, from 286.7 to 101.9 at $\epsilon=8$, assuming that the blurred version of a training image is available as a public feature. Overall, our work provides a new approach to private data analysis that can help reduce the utility cost of DP while still providing strong privacy guarantees.</p></details> |  |

Representing proteins as voxelized densities, or proxels, enables new tasks and conditioning capabilities. We generate proteins encoded as proxels via a 3D CNN-based VAE in conjunction with a diffusion model operating on its latent space. Compared to state-of-the-art models, ProxelGen's samples achieve higher novelty, better FID scores, and the same level of designability as the training set. ProxelGen's advantages are demonstrated in a standard motif scaffolding benchmark, and we show how 3D density-based generation allows for more flexible shape conditioning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoCo4D: Comprehensive and Complex 4D Scene Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19798v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing 4D synthesis methods primarily focus on object-level generation or dynamic scene synthesis with limited novel views, restricting their ability to generate multi-view consistent and immersive dynamic 4D scenes. To address these constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating detailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include images. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. More results are presented on our website https://colezwhy.github.io/coco4d/.</p></details> | 16 pages,10 figures |
| **[Alleviating User-Sensitive bias with Fair Generative Sequential Recommendation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19777v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation fairness has recently attracted much attention. In the real world, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with the same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same patterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation preference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness. Diffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great success in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and represent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of adaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore, we use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the diversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model based on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the original distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition model, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse reconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is completed by injecting multi-interests representational information that eliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In the inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition by using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to reconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on accuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes the degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.</p></details> |  |

In Kling-Foley, we introduce multimodal diffusion transformers to model the interactions between video, audio, and text modalities, and combine it with a visual semantic representation module and an audio-visual synchronization module to enhance alignment capabilities. Specifically, these modules align video conditions with latent audio elements at the frame level, thereby improving semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization. Together with text conditions, this integrated approach enables precise generation of video-matching sound effects. In addition, we propose a universal latent audio codec that can achieve high-quality modeling in various scenarios such as sound effects, speech, singing, and music. We employ a stereo rendering method that imbues synthesized audio with a spatial presence. At the same time, in order to make up for the incomplete types and annotations of the open-source benchmark, we also open-source an industrial-level benchmark Kling-Audio-Eval. Our experiments show that Kling-Foley trained with the flow matching objective achieves new audio-visual SOTA performance among public models in terms of distribution matching, semantic alignment, temporal alignment and audio quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noise Consistency Training: A Native Approach for One-Step Generator in Learning Additional Controls](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19741v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency, adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints, semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge. Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular, data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass, surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both generation quality and computational efficiency.

The key finding is that positional embeddings, which have been seldom used by text-to-music generation models in the conditioner for text conditions, are critical when the condition of interest is a function of time. Using melody control as an example, our experiments show that simply adding rotary positional embeddings to the decoupled cross-attention layers increases control accuracy from 56.6% to 61.1%, while requiring 6.75 times fewer trainable parameters than state-of-the-art fine-tuning mechanisms, using the same pre-trained diffusion Transformer model of Stable Audio Open. We evaluate various forms of musical attribute control, audio inpainting, and audio outpainting, demonstrating improved controllability over MusicGen-Large and Stable Audio Open ControlNet at a significantly lower fine-tuning cost, with only 85M trainble parameters.

Current unsupervised or weakly-supervised anomaly detection methods rely on autoencoder or generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained only on healthy data. While these approaches reduce annotation dependency, GAN-based methods are notably more challenging to train than non-GAN alternatives (such as autoencoders) due to issues such as the simultaneous optimization of two competing networks, mode collapse, and training instability. In this paper, we present the weakly-supervised $\textbf{I}$mplicitly-$\textbf{g}$uided $\textbf{CO}$u$\textbf{N}$terfactual diffusion model for $\textbf{D}$etecting $\textbf{A}$nomalies in $\textbf{PET}$ images (IgCONDA-PET). The solution is developed and validated using PET scans from six retrospective cohorts consisting of a total of 2652 cases (multi-cancer, multi-tracer) containing both local and public datasets (spanning multiple centers). The training is conditioned on image class labels (healthy vs. unhealthy) via attention modules, and we employ implicit diffusion guidance. We perform counterfactual generation which facilitates "unhealthy-to-healthy" domain translation by generating a synthetic, healthy version of an unhealthy input image, enabling the detection of anomalies through the calculated differences. The performance of our method was compared against several other deep learning based weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods as well as traditional methods like 41% SUV$_\text{max}$ thresholding. We also highlight the importance of incorporating attention modules in our network for the detection of small anomalies. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ahxmeds/IgCONDA-PET.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, current methods often rely on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits. First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video (I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture. To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project Page: https://cjeen.github.io/LoraEditPaper</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Guidance in the Frequency Domain Enables High-Fidelity Sampling at Low CFG Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19713v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern conditional diffusion models. Although highly effective in practice, the underlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt alignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by analyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high frequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically, low-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while high-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a uniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to oversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality at low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance (FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency components and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG improves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high CFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets and models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while preserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG, establishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard classifier-free guidance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering Conceptual Blindspots in Generative Image Models Using Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19708v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their impressive performance, generative image models trained on large-scale datasets frequently fail to produce images with seemingly simple concepts -- e.g., human hands or objects appearing in groups of four -- that are reasonably expected to appear in the training data. These failure modes have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and characterizing "conceptual blindspots" -- concepts present in the training data but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings, enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with 32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models (Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying data-generating process.</p></details> |  |

Despite great success in dense-view reconstruction scenarios, rendering a detailed scene from insufficient captured views is still an ill-posed optimization problem, often resulting in artifacts and distortions in unseen areas. In this paper, we propose ReconX, a novel 3D scene reconstruction paradigm that reframes the ambiguous reconstruction challenge as a temporal generation task. The key insight is to unleash the strong generative prior of large pre-trained video diffusion models for sparse-view reconstruction. However, 3D view consistency struggles to be accurately preserved in directly generated video frames from pre-trained models. To address this, given limited input views, the proposed ReconX first constructs a global point cloud and encodes it into a contextual space as the 3D structure condition. Guided by the condition, the video diffusion model then synthesizes video frames that are both detail-preserved and exhibit a high degree of 3D consistency, ensuring the coherence of the scene from various perspectives. Finally, we recover the 3D scene from the generated video through a confidence-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets show the superiority of our ReconX over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and generalizability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://liuff19.github.io/ReconX</p></details> |

Less attention has been given to making these systems controllable and interactive for users. In text-music retrieval, the ambiguity of freeform language creates a many-to-many mapping, often resulting in inflexible or unsatisfying results. We introduce Generative Diffusion Retriever (GDR), a novel framework that leverages diffusion models to generate queries in a retrieval-optimized latent space. This enables controllability through generative tools such as negative prompting and denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) inversion, opening a new direction in retrieval control. GDR improves retrieval performance over contrastive teacher models and supports retrieval in audio-only latent spaces using non-jointly trained encoders. Finally, we demonstrate that GDR enables effective post-hoc manipulation of retrieval behavior, enhancing interactive control for text-music retrieval tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ISMIR 2025</p></details> |

Despite progress in computer vision, existing benchmarks reveal significant gaps in models' abilities to accurately recognize object attributes and reason about spatial relationships, both essential for dynamic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose MIRAGE, a multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate models' capabilities in Counting (object attribute recognition), Relation (spatial relational reasoning), and Counting with Relation. Through diverse and complex scenarios requiring fine-grained recognition and reasoning, MIRAGE highlights critical limitations in state-of-the-art models, underscoring the need for improved representations and reasoning frameworks. By targeting these foundational abilities, MIRAGE provides a pathway toward spatiotemporal reasoning in future research.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets (e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in unsupervised domain-adaptive counting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with varying density distributions. The results show that our method outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Unlike prior approaches that mostly rely on deterministic part pose prediction and category-specific training, Assembler is designed to handle diverse, in-the-wild objects with varying part counts, geometries, and structures. It addresses the core challenges of scaling to general 3D part assembly through innovations in task formulation, representation, and data. First, Assembler casts part assembly as a generative problem and employs diffusion models to sample plausible configurations, effectively capturing ambiguities arising from symmetry, repeated parts, and multiple valid assemblies. Second, we introduce a novel shape-centric representation based on sparse anchor point clouds, enabling scalable generation in Euclidean space rather than SE(3) pose prediction. Third, we construct a large-scale dataset of over 320K diverse part-object assemblies using a synthesis and filtering pipeline built on existing 3D shape repositories. Assembler achieves state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and is the first to demonstrate high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects. Based on Assembler, we further introduce an interesting part-aware 3D modeling system that generates high-resolution, editable objects from images, demonstrating potential for interactive and compositional design.

| **[Open-World Object Counting in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15368v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and significantly outperforms strong baselines.

| **[ViCrit: A Verifiable Reinforcement Learning Proxy Task for Visual Perception in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10128v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle, synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math, showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Same Task, Different Circuits: Disentangling Modality-Specific Mechanisms in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09047v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the \textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach for reducing it.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARMOT: Masked Autoencoder for Modeling Transient Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08470v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained models have demonstrated impressive success in many modalities such as language and vision. Recent works facilitate the pretraining paradigm in imaging research. Transients are a novel modality, which are captured for an object as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved sensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of hidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using NLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or surfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned from datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling transient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a self-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient datasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features from partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the unmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts full measurements. Pretrained on TransVerse-a synthesized transient dataset of 500K 3D models-MARMOT adapts to downstream imaging tasks using direct feature transfer or decoder finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the efficiency of our MARMOT.</p></details> |  |
| **[ComPtr: Towards Diverse Bi-source Dense Prediction Tasks via A Simple yet General Complementary Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12349v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) has advanced the field of dense prediction, while gradually dissolving the inherent barriers between different tasks. However, most existing works focus on designing architectures and constructing visual cues only for the specific task, which ignores the potential uniformity introduced by the DL paradigm. In this paper, we attempt to construct a novel $\underline{ComP}$lementary $\underline{tr}$ansformer, $\textbf{ComPtr}$, for diverse bi-source dense prediction tasks. Specifically, unlike existing methods that over-specialize in a single task or a subset of tasks, ComPtr starts from the more general concept of bi-source dense prediction. Based on the basic dependence on information complementarity, we propose consistency enhancement and difference awareness components with which ComPtr can evacuate and collect important visual semantic cues from different image sources for diverse tasks, respectively. ComPtr treats different inputs equally and builds an efficient dense interaction model in the form of sequence-to-sequence on top of the transformer. This task-generic design provides a smooth foundation for constructing the unified model that can simultaneously deal with various bi-source information. In extensive experiments across several representative vision tasks, i.e. remote sensing change detection, RGB-T crowd counting, RGB-D/T salient object detection, and RGB-D semantic segmentation, the proposed method consistently obtains favorable performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/lartpang/ComPtr.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination at a Glance: Controlled Visual Edits and Fine-Grained Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07227v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on vision-language tasks but still struggle with fine-grained visual differences, leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts. We attribute this to limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute, count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines, including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present the first large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions: (1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3) How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context? Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key areas for improvement in medical visual language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection-Driven Object Count Optimization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11721v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately controlling object count in text-to-image generation remains a key challenge. Supervised methods often fail, as training data rarely covers all count variations. Methods that manipulate the denoising process to add or remove objects can help; however, they still require labeled data, limit robustness and image quality, and rely on a slow, iterative process. Pre-trained differentiable counting models that rely on soft object density summation exist and could steer generation, but employing them presents three main challenges: (i) they are pre-trained on clean images, making them less effective during denoising steps that operate on noisy inputs; (ii) they are not robust to viewpoint changes; and (iii) optimization is computationally expensive, requiring repeated model evaluations per image. We propose a new framework that uses pre-trained object counting techniques and object detectors to guide generation. First, we optimize a counting token using an outer-loop loss computed on fully generated images. Second, we introduce a detection-driven scaling term that corrects errors caused by viewpoint and proportion shifts, among other factors, without requiring backpropagation through the detection model. Third, we show that the optimized parameters can be reused for new prompts, removing the need for repeated optimization. Our method provides efficiency through token reuse, flexibility via compatibility with various detectors, and accuracy with improved counting across diverse object categories.</p></details> | Pre-print |

To evaluate them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However, such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception, reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology, inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant. This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities.

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology. OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained subcategories. Through Internet data crawling and careful manual annotation, we construct over 1.5K question-answer pairs.

However, current image editing largely overlooks multi-object scenarios, where precise control over object categories, counts, and spatial layouts remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce a new task, quantity-and-layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit), which aims to enable fine-grained control of object quantity and spatial structure in complex scenes. We further propose IMAGHarmony, a structure-aware framework that incorporates harmony-aware attention (HA) to integrate multimodal semantics, explicitly modeling object counts and layouts to enhance editing accuracy and structural consistency. In addition, we observe that diffusion models are susceptible to initial noise and exhibit strong preferences for specific noise patterns. Motivated by this, we present a preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that chooses semantically aligned initial noise samples based on vision-language matching, thereby improving generation stability and layout consistency in multi-object editing. To support evaluation, we construct HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGHarmony consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural alignment and semantic accuracy.

Although prior layout-based methods improve object arrangements using spatial constraints with 2D layouts, they often struggle to capture 3D positioning and sacrifice quality and coherence. In this work, we introduce ComposeAnything, a novel framework for improving compositional image generation without retraining existing T2I models. Our approach first leverages the chain-of-thought reasoning abilities of LLMs to produce 2.5D semantic layouts from text, consisting of 2D object bounding boxes enriched with depth information and detailed captions. Based on this layout, we generate a spatial and depth aware coarse composite of objects that captures the intended composition, serving as a strong and interpretable prior that replaces stochastic noise initialization in diffusion-based T2I models. This prior guides the denoising process through object prior reinforcement and spatial-controlled denoising, enabling seamless generation of compositional objects and coherent backgrounds, while allowing refinement of inaccurate priors. ComposeAnything outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the T2I-CompBench and NSR-1K benchmarks for prompts with 2D/3D spatial arrangements, high object counts, and surreal compositions. Human evaluations further demonstrate that our model generates high-quality images with compositions that faithfully reflect the text.</p></details> |  |

Despite their advanced visual perception, large vision-language models (LVLMs) are known to struggle with counting tasks. In this work, we evaluate the performance of several recent LVLMs on visual counting tasks across multiple counting and vision datasets. We observe that while their performance may be less prone to error for small numbers of objects, they exhibit significant weaknesses as the number of objects increases. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple yet effective baseline method that enhances LVLMs' counting ability for large numbers of objects using a divide-and-conquer approach. Our method decomposes counting problems into sub-tasks. Moreover, it incorporates a mechanism to prevent objects from being split during division, which could otherwise lead to repetitive counting -- a common issue in a naive divide-and-conquer implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various datasets and benchmarks, establishing it as a valuable reference for evaluating future solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 24 Figures, 19 Tables</p></details> |

In this work, we test how the knowledge about popular subjects hurt the accuracy of vision language models (VLMs) on standard, objective visual tasks of counting and identification. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs are strongly biased (e.g, unable to recognize a fourth stripe has been added to a 3-stripe Adidas logo) scoring an average of 17.05% accuracy in counting (e.g., counting stripes in an Adidas-like logo) across 7 diverse domains from animals, logos, chess, board games, optical illusions, to patterned grids. Insert text (e.g., "Adidas") describing the subject name into the counterfactual image further decreases VLM accuracy. The biases in VLMs are so strong that instructing them to double-check their results or rely exclusively on image details to answer improves counting accuracy by only +2 points, on average. Our work presents an interesting failure mode in VLMs and an automated framework for testing VLM biases.

| **[Monotone Bounded-Depth Complexity of Homomorphism Polynomials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22894v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For every fixed graph $H$, it is known that homomorphism counts from $H$ and colorful $H$-subgraph counts can be determined in $O(n^{t+1})$ time on $n$-vertex input graphs $G$, where $t$ is the treewidth of $H$. On the other hand, a running time of $n^{o(t / \log t)}$ would refute the exponential-time hypothesis. Komarath, Pandey and Rahul (Algorithmica, 2023) studied algebraic variants of these counting problems, i.e., homomorphism and subgraph $\textit{polynomials}$ for fixed graphs $H$. These polynomials are weighted sums over the objects counted above, where each object is weighted by the product of variables corresponding to edges contained in the object. As shown by Komarath et al., the $\textit{monotone}$ circuit complexity of the homomorphism polynomial for $H$ is $\Theta(n^{\mathrm{tw}(H)+1})$. In this paper, we characterize the power of monotone $\textit{bounded-depth}$ circuits for homomorphism and colorful subgraph polynomials. This leads us to discover a natural hierarchy of graph parameters $\mathrm{tw}_\Delta(H)$, for fixed $\Delta \in \mathbb N$, which capture the width of tree-decompositions for $H$ when the underlying tree is required to have depth at most $\Delta$. We prove that monotone circuits of product-depth $\Delta$ computing the homomorphism polynomial for $H$ require size $\Theta(n^{\mathrm{tw}_\Delta(H^{\dagger})+1})$, where $H^{\dagger}$ is the graph obtained from $H$ by removing all degree-$1$ vertices. This allows us to derive an optimal depth hierarchy theorem for monotone bounded-depth circuits through graph-theoretic arguments.</p></details> | 22 pages, 1 figure |

The key challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity, offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others; linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects. To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy, which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic coverage.

| **[Low-Complexity Semantic Packet Aggregation for Token Communication via Lookahead Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19451v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokens are fundamental processing units of generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), and token communication (TC) is essential for enabling remote AI-generate content (AIGC) and wireless LLM applications. Unlike traditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each token depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency makes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can significantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this paper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token similarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage channels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is combinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To address this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with lookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces the residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the message-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain token packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a lookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates without replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates sampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity. Experiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned images) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores comparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up to 40$\times$. Compared to other linear-complexity algorithms such as the genetic algorithm (GA), SemPA-Look achieves 10$\times$ lower complexity, demonstrating its practicality for remote AIGC and other TC applications.</p></details> |  |

Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation). However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways, limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor (NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning benchmarks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

Owing to massive and diverse information conveyed in real images, it is challenging for text-to-image generative models to synthesize informative training data with hand-crafted prompts. Considering the impressive ability of large generative models, could such models directly synthesize good training images for prediction tasks with proper prompts? We offer an affirmative response to this question by proposing a simple yet effective method, validated through ImageNet classification. Specifically, we caption each real image with the advanced captioning model to obtain informative and faithful prompts that extract class-relevant information and clarify the polysemy of class names. The image captions and class names are concatenated to prompt generative models for training image synthesis. We show that this simple caption incorporation significantly boosts the informativeness of synthetic data therefore enhancing downstream model generalization. More importantly, besides improvements in data augmentation and privacy preservation, our experiments demonstrate that synthesized images can exceed real data in terms of out-of-distribution robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 2 figure, 15 tables.

Unlike conventional image captioning and retrieval datasets that emphasize surface-level descriptions, OpenEvents V1 focuses on contextual and temporal grounding through two primary tasks: (1) generating rich, event-aware image captions and (2) retrieving event-relevant images based on narrative-style textual queries. The dataset contains over 200,000 news articles and 400,000 associated images sourced from CNN and The Guardian, spanning diverse domains and time periods. We provide extensive baseline results and standardized evaluation protocols for both tasks. OpenEvents V1 establishes a robust foundation for developing multimodal models capable of deep reasoning over complex real-world events.

In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/oyt9306/RePIC</p></details> |

Throughout the years, several approaches have been adopted to explain an input image fed by the user. From detecting an object in a given image to explaining it in human understandable sentence, to having a conversation describing the image, this problem has seen an immense change throughout the years, However, the existing works have been often found to (a) hallucinate objects that do not exist in the image and/or (b) lack identifying the complete set of objects present in the image. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigate these drawbacks of inconsistency and incompleteness of the objects recognized during the image explanation. To enable this, we propose an interpretable framework that can be plugged atop diverse image explaining frameworks including Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Prompt-based AI using LLMs, thereby enhancing their explanation capabilities by rectifying the incorrect or missing objects. We further measure the efficacy of the rectified explanations generated through our proposed approaches leveraging object based precision metrics, and showcase the improvements in the inconsistency and completeness of image explanations. Quantitatively, the proposed framework is able to improve the explanations over the baseline architectures of Image Captioning (improving the completeness by 81.81% and inconsistency by 37.10%), Visual Question Answering(average of 9.6% and 37.10% in completeness and inconsistency respectively) and Prompt-based AI model (0.01% and 5.2% for completeness and inconsistency respectively) surpassing the current state-of-the-art by a substantial margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CODS-COMAD December 2024</p></details> |

However, they often suffer from over-reliance on spurious correlations, primarily due to linguistic priors that distract the model from leveraging actual visual information. To address these issues, we introduce MMGrounded-PostAlign, a post-multimodal alignment framework designed to enhance the visual understanding capabilities and mitigate the hallucinations of MLLMs. Our framework incorporates a multimodal grounding module for both visual grounding, which identifies the referred object in the image, and textual grounding, which generates the rationale for the final answer, ensuring that outputs are anchored in both visual and textual evidence. To mitigate the hallucinations, we introduce a negative rejection mechanism in the visual grounding module to distinguish grounded entities from non-existent objects influenced by linguistic biases. On the textual grounding side, we propose a selective reasoning mechanism that adjusts the model's reasoning strategy based on query complexity. Extensive evaluations are conducted on benchmarks such as POPE, HaloQuest, VQAv2, MME, and MMBench showing significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding and hallucination suppression.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Memory-Driven Sparse Attention Matrix (MDSAM) , a novel training-free approach that dynamically captures and refines the attention allocated to image tokens at each layer. MDSAM memorizes attention patterns and activates updates through alignment during decoding, enhancing focus on relevant image tokens while effectively reducing hallucinations. We evaluate MDSAM on multiple benchmarks for tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering, demonstrating its ability to consistently reduce hallucinations and improve reliability. Compatible with various LVLM architectures, MDSAM highlights its adaptability and effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations without requiring additional training or external tools.</p></details> |  |

Standard data filtering approaches succeed in removing mismatched text-image pairs, but permit semantically related but highly abstract or subjective text. These approaches lack the fine-grained ability to isolate the most concrete samples that provide the strongest signal for learning in a noisy dataset. In this work, we propose a new metric, image caption concreteness, that evaluates caption text without an image reference to measure its concreteness and relevancy for use in multimodal learning. Our approach leverages strong foundation models for measuring visual-semantic information loss in multimodal representations. We demonstrate that this strongly correlates with human evaluation of concreteness in both single-word and sentence-level texts. Moreover, we show that curation using ICC complements existing approaches: It succeeds in selecting the highest quality samples from multimodal web-scale datasets to allow for efficient training in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 (Finding).

This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs via post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipeline, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs. The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong closed-source models in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training Pipeline: Unlike general MLLMs that typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm, we find that a single-stage approach is more effective for domain adaptation. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. Finally, we fully open-source our models, code, and data to encourage future research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://huggingface.co/AdaptLLM</p></details> |

Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9 sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline, high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection.

However, we reveal that this approach can lead to weak vision-language alignment, making these models overly dependent on costly instruction-following data. To address this, we introduce EXGRA-MED, a novel multi-graph alignment framework that jointly aligns images, instruction responses, and extended captions in the latent space, advancing semantic grounding and cross-modal coherence. To scale to large LLMs (e.g., LLaMa-7B), we develop an efficient end-to-end training scheme using black-box gradient estimation, enabling fast and scalable optimization. Empirically, EXGRA-MED matches LLAVA-MED's performance using just 10% of pre-training data, achieving a 20.13% gain on VQA-RAD and approaching full-data performance. It also outperforms strong baselines like BIOMEDGPT and RADFM on visual chatbot and zero-shot classification tasks, demonstrating its promise for efficient, high-quality vision-language integration in medical AI.</p></details> | Version 2 |

Many models have been developed to generate these captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet, authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances, these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>The L...</summary><p>The LaMP-CAP dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/Crowd-AI-Lab/lamp-cap</p></details> |

With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), it is essential to assess their ability to effectively comprehend these punchlines. However, existing benchmarks on punchline comprehension suffer from three major limitations: 1) language shortcuts that allow models to solely rely on text, 2) lack of question diversity, and 3) narrow focus on a specific domain of multimodal content (e.g., cartoon). To address these limitations, we introduce a multimodal \textbf{Punch}line comprehension \textbf{Bench}mark, named \textbf{PunchBench}, which is tailored for accurate and comprehensive evaluation of punchline comprehension. To enhance the evaluation accuracy, we generate synonymous and antonymous captions by modifying original captions, which mitigates the impact of shortcuts in the captions. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, PunchBench incorporates diverse question formats and image-captions from various domains. On this basis, we conduct extensive evaluations and reveal a significant gap between state-of-the-art MLLMs and humans in punchline comprehension. To improve punchline comprehension, we propose Simple-to-Complex Chain-of-Question (SC-CoQ) strategy, enabling the models to incrementally address complicated questions by first mastering simple ones. SC-CoQ effectively enhances the performance of various MLLMs on PunchBench, surpassing in-context learning and chain-of-thought.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the camera-ready version for ACL 2025</p></details> |

The growing demand for video applications sets higher requirements for high-quality video generation models. For example, the generation of movie-level Ultra-High Definition (UHD) videos and the creation of 4K short video content. However, the existing public datasets cannot support related research and applications. In this paper, we first propose a high-quality open-sourced UHD-4K (22.4\% of which are 8K) text-to-video dataset named UltraVideo, which contains a wide range of topics (more than 100 kinds), and each video has 9 structured captions with one summarized caption (average of 824 words). Specifically, we carefully design a highly automated curation process with four stages to obtain the final high-quality dataset: \textit{i)} collection of diverse and high-quality video clips. \textit{ii)} statistical data filtering. \textit{iii)} model-based data purification. \textit{iv)} generation of comprehensive, structured captions. In addition, we expand Wan to UltraWan-1K/-4K, which can natively generate high-quality 1K/4K videos with more consistent text controllability, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data curation.We believe that this work can make a significant contribution to future research on UHD video generation.

In this paper, we propose Modality-Aware Adaptive Fusion Scheduling (MA-AFS), a general framework that learns to dynamically modulate the contribution of each modality on a per-instance basis. MA-AFS introduces a lightweight neural scheduler that predicts modality fusion weights by integrating visual and textual entropy signals along with cross-modal agreement cues. This enables the model to adaptively emphasize more reliable modalities, especially under noisy, missing, or misaligned inputs. We formulate the fusion process as a differentiable scheduling mechanism, analyze its theoretical consistency and regularization effect, and demonstrate that it improves robustness without increasing model capacity significantly. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, captioning, and visual question answering show that MA-AFS achieves consistent performance gains over strong baselines such as CLIP, ALBEF, and BLIP. Moreover, MA-AFS exhibits improved robustness under modality corruption and enhanced generalization under domain shifts. Our work highlights the importance of adaptive fusion and opens a promising direction toward reliable and uncertainty-aware multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Modality Scheduling for Multimodal Large Models via Confidence, Uncertainty, and Semantic Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12724v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language understanding and generation tasks. However, existing MLLMs typically rely on static modality fusion strategies, which treat all modalities equally regardless of their instance-level reliability or semantic contribution. This often leads to suboptimal performance, especially in scenarios with noisy, missing, or misaligned modalities. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Modality Scheduling (DMS), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the contribution of each modality at a per-sample level. DMS evaluates each modality based on three key factors: (1) \textit{confidence}, estimated from predictive entropy; (2) \textit{uncertainty}, obtained via Monte Carlo dropout; and (3) \textit{semantic consistency}, computed through inter-modal similarity. These signals are combined through a learnable or rule-based scheduler to generate soft modality weights used in downstream fusion.To ensure stable training, we further introduce a \textit{Modality Weight Consistency Loss}, which regularizes the fused representation to stay close to unimodal embeddings proportionally to their assigned weights. Our method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing MLLMs such as BLIP-2 and LLaVA. Experimental results on VQA, image-text retrieval, and captioning tasks show that DMS significantly improves both clean and robust performance, especially under modality corruption or dropout conditions. This work provides a general and effective mechanism to enable instance-aware and robustness-enhanced multimodal modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Will Pre-Training Ever End? A First Step Toward Next-Generation Foundation MLLMs via Self-Improving Systematic Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12303v6)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) has shifted focus from pre-training to inference-time computation and post-training optimization, largely due to concerns over the availability of high-quality human data. However, these strategies alone are insufficient to drive substantial model improvements. We argue that effective model advancement requires strong synergy among pre-training, inference-time computation, and post-training optimization. In this paper, we introduce Self-Improving cognition (SIcog), a self-learning framework for constructing next-generation foundation MLLMs by imparting multimodal knowledge and enhancing systematic cognitive capabilities through multimodal pre-training with self-generated data. Specifically, we propose Chain-of-Description for step-by-step visual understanding and integrate structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to support in-depth multimodal reasoning. SIcog first equips a base model with systematic perception and reasoning using minimal external supervision. The enhanced models then generate candidate image captions and CoT reasoning responses for unlabeled images and image-question pairs across diverse tasks, which are filtered through a semantic-similarity-guided self-consistency mechanism. These high-quality, self-generated samples enable large-scale multimodal pre-training, creating a self-improvement loop. Experiments demonstrate SIcog's effectiveness in developing MLLMs with enhanced multimodal cognition. Using only 213K self-generated pre-training samples, SIcog achieves significant improvements, including +3.6% on MMStar and +3.5% on AI2D, outperforming previous pre-training approaches. When combined with post-training techniques for CoT reasoning, SIcog yields +9% gains on MMVet and +8.5% on ScienceQA.</p></details> | 43 pages. Preprint |

Playful interactions emerged as an important way for users to make sense of the ever-changing AI technologies, yet remained underexamined. We target this gap by investigating playful interactions exhibited by users of a popular AI technology, ChatGPT. Through a thematic analysis of 372 user-generated posts on the ChatGPT subreddit, we found that more than half (54\%) of user discourse revolved around playful interactions. The analysis further allowed us to construct a preliminary framework to describe these interactions, categorizing them into six types: reflecting, jesting, imitating, challenging, tricking, and contriving; each included sub-categories. This study contributes to HCI and CSCW by identifying the diverse ways users engage in playful interactions with AI. It examines how these interactions can help users understand AI's agency, shape human-AI relationships, and provide insights for designing AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CSCW 2025; 23 pages</p></details> |

Most methods typically follow a two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection? To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly, these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation, strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions. Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52% at overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.</p></details> | <details><summary>1st p...</summary><p>1st place on EmbodiedScan visual grounding</p></details> |

The Bridgeless protocol is run by a set of validators, responsible for verifying deposit transactions on the source chain and generating the corresponding withdrawals on the target chain. The protocol is designed to be chain-agnostic and the validators interact with each supported chain via a chain client. It currently supports EVM-compatible chains, the Zano, and the Bitcoin chains. The paper formalizes all involved subprotocols and describes the conditions under which the protocol maintains safety and liveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Origami flip graph of the $2\times n$ Miura-ori](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19700v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given an origami crease pattern $C=(V,E)$, a straight-line planar graph embedded in a region of $\mathbb{R}^2$, we assign each crease to be either a mountain crease (which bends convexly) or a valley crease (which bends concavely), creating a mountain-valley (MV) assignment $\mu:E\to\{-1,1\}$. An MV assignment $\mu$ is locally valid if the faces around each vertex in $C$ can be folded flat under $\mu$. In this paper, we investigate locally valid MV assignments of the Miura-ori, $M_{m,n}$, an $m\times n$ parallelogram tessellation used in numerous engineering applications. The origami flip graph $OFG(C)$ of $C$ is a graph whose vertices are locally valid MV assignments of $C$, and two vertices are adjacent if they differ by a face flip, an operation that swaps the MV-parity of every crease bordering a given face of $C$. We enumerate the number of vertices and edges in $OFG(M_{2,n})$ and prove several facts about the degrees of vertices in $OFG(M_{2,n})$. By finding recurrence relations, we show that the number of vertices of degree $d$ and $2n-a$ (for $0\leq a$) are both described by polynomials of particular degrees. We then prove that the diameter of $OFG(M_{2,n})$ is $\lceil \frac{n^2}{2}\rceil$ using techniques from 3-coloring reconfiguration graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lemmanaid: Neuro-Symbolic Lemma Conjecturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04942v3)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically conjecturing useful, interesting and novel lemmas would greatly improve automated reasoning tools and lower the bar for formalizing mathematics in proof assistants. It is however a very challenging task for both neural and symbolic approaches. We present the first steps towards a practical neuro-symbolic lemma conjecturing tool, Lemmanaid, that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic methods, and evaluate it on proof libraries for the Isabelle proof assistant. We train an LLM to generate lemma templates that describe the shape of a lemma, and use symbolic methods to fill in the details. We compare Lemmanaid against an LLM trained to generate complete lemma statements as well as previous fully symbolic conjecturing methods. Lemmanaid outperforms both neural and symbolic methods on test sets from Isabelle's HOL library and from its Archive of Formal Proofs, discovering between 29-39.5% of the gold standard human written lemmas. This is 8-15% more lemmas than the neural-only method. By leveraging the best of both symbolic and neural methods we can generate useful lemmas for a wide range of input domains, facilitating computer-assisted theory development and formalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resilience assessment framework for cyber-physical distribution power system based on coordinated cyber-physical attacks under dynamic game](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19636v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Owing to the advanced communication networks and intelligent electronic devices, the cyber-physical distribution systems (CPDSs) possess the capability to perform flexible economic dispatch and achieve rapid self-healing from extreme events. Meanwhile, the deep integration of cyber and physical systems makes CPDS vulnerable to coordinated cyber-physical attacks. In this paper, a resilience assessment framework for the CPDS under coordinated cyber-physical attacks is proposed to investigate the impact of the coordinated attacks on load loss and service restoration in CPDS. First, a three-stage defender-attacker-defender dynamic game model considering fake base station (FBS) and physical attacks for CPDS is established, aiming at seeking the optimal defense resource deployment strategy to enhance the resilience of the CPDS. The physical attack is launched to cause faults on the power lines, and the FBS attack is employed to interrupt the service of wireless cellular network to hinder the self-healing process of the CPDS. The lognormal shadowing model and search theory are applied to quantitatively describe the process of the coordinated cyber-physical attacks. Further, the constructed three-stage dynamic game model is equivalently recast as a tri-level max-min-max optimization model, which is solved using column-and-constraint generation combined with enumeration method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed resilience assessment framework and solution strategy is demonstrated by conducting simulation analysis on the modified IEEE 33-node CPDS and a real-world 47-node CPDS in China.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learning Point Correspondences In Radar 3D Point Clouds For Radar-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18580v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using 3D point clouds in odometry estimation in robotics often requires finding a set of correspondences between points in subsequent scans. While there are established methods for point clouds of sufficient quality, state-of-the-art still struggles when this quality drops. Thus, this paper presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting robust point correspondences between pairs of noisy, sparse and unstructured 3D point clouds from a light-weight, low-power, inexpensive, consumer-grade System-on-Chip (SoC) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensor. Our network is based on the transformer architecture which allows leveraging the attention mechanism to discover pairs of points in consecutive scans with the greatest mutual affinity. The proposed network is trained in a self-supervised way using set-based multi-label classification cross-entropy loss, where the ground-truth set of matches is found by solving the Linear Sum Assignment (LSA) optimization problem, which avoids tedious hand annotation of the training data. Additionally, posing the loss calculation as multi-label classification permits supervising on point correspondences directly instead of on odometry error, which is not feasible for sparse and noisy data from the SoC radar we use. We evaluate our method with an open-source state-of-the-art Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) framework in real-world Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights and with the widely used public Coloradar dataset. Evaluation shows that the proposed method improves the position estimation accuracy by over 14 % and 19 % on average, respectively.

| **[Global Microprocessor Correctness in the Presence of Transient Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17154v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Correctness for microprocessors is generally understood to be conformance with the associated instruction set architecture (ISA). This is the basis for one of the most important abstractions in computer science, allowing hardware designers to develop highly-optimized processors that are functionally "equivalent" to an ideal processor that executes instructions atomically. This specification is almost always informal, e.g., commercial microprocessors generally do not come with conformance specifications. In this paper, we advocate for the use of formal specifications, using the theory of refinement. We introduce notions of correctness that can be used to deal with transient execution attacks, including Meltdown and Spectre. Such attacks have shown that ubiquitous microprocessor optimizations, appearing in numerous processors for decades, are inherently buggy. Unlike alternative approaches that use non-interference properties, our notion of correctness is global, meaning it is single specification that: formalizes conformance, includes functional correctness and is parameterized by an microarchitecture. We introduce action skipping refinement, a new type of refinement and we describe how our notions of refinement can be decomposed into properties that are more amenable to automated verification using the the concept of shared-resource commitment refinement maps. We do this in the context of formal, fully executable bit- and cycle-accurate models of an ISA and a microprocessor. Finally, we show how light-weight formal methods based on property-based testing can be used to identify transient execution bugs.</p></details> |  |

However, training the candidates generated by the search algorithm for performance evaluation incurs considerable computational overhead. Our method, dubbed nasgraph, remarkably reduces the computational costs by converting neural architectures to graphs and using the average degree, a graph measure, as the proxy in lieu of the evaluation metric. Our training-free NAS method is data-agnostic and light-weight. It can find the best architecture among 200 randomly sampled architectures from NAS-Bench201 in 217 CPU seconds. Besides, our method is able to achieve competitive performance on various datasets including NASBench-101, NASBench-201, and NDS search spaces. We also demonstrate that nasgraph generalizes to more challenging tasks on Micro TransNAS-Bench-101.</p></details> |  |

Such models are light-weight and computationally efficient, allowing them to be trained on consumer laptops. SHRED-based models rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the temporal encoding and spatial decoding respectively. Despite the relatively simple structure of SHRED, they are able to predict chaotic dynamical systems on different physical, spatial, and temporal scales directly from a sparse set of sensor measurements. In this work, we improve SHRED by leveraging transformers (T-SHRED) for the temporal encoding which improves performance on next-step state prediction on large datasets. We also introduce a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) attention mechanism into T-SHRED to perform symbolic regression directly on the latent space as part of the model regularization architecture. Symbolic regression improves model interpretability by learning and regularizing the dynamics of the latent space during training. We analyze the performance of T-SHRED on three different dynamical systems ranging from low-data to high-data regimes. We observe that SINDy attention T-SHRED accurately predicts future frames based on an interpretable symbolic model across all tested datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Transactions of the Royal Society (Symbolic Regression in the Physical Sciences)</p></details> |

This paper develops an uncertainty quantification approach in the context of visual localization for autonomous driving, where locations are selected based on images. Key to our approach is to learn the measurement uncertainty using light-weight sensor error model, which maps both image feature and semantic information to 2-dimensional error distribution. Our approach enables uncertainty estimation conditioned on the specific context of the matched image pair, implicitly capturing other critical, unannotated factors (e.g., city vs highway, dynamic vs static scenes, winter vs summer) in a latent manner. We demonstrate the accuracy of our uncertainty prediction framework using the Ithaca365 dataset, which includes variations in lighting and weather (sunny, night, snowy). Both the uncertainty quantification of the sensor+network is evaluated, along with Bayesian localization filters using unique sensor gating method. Results show that the measurement error does not follow a Gaussian distribution with poor weather and lighting conditions, and is better predicted by our Gaussian Mixture model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

This class of functions has enabled the development of non-linear statistical concepts, such as distance variance, distance covariance, and distance correlation. However, the computational burden associated with $\mathcal{\varepsilon}$-statistics is substantial, particularly when the data reside in multivariate space. To address this challenge, we have developed a method to significantly reduce memory requirements and accelerate computations, thereby facilitating the analysis of large data sets. The following cases are demonstrated: univariate and multivariate distance variance, distance covariance, partial distance correlation, energy distance, and hypothesis testing for the equality of univariate distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Delayed Expansion AGT: Kinodynamic Planning with Application to Tractor-Trailer Parking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13421v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kinodynamic planning of articulated vehicles in cluttered environments faces additional challenges arising from high-dimensional state space and complex system dynamics. Built upon [1],[2], this work proposes the DE-AGT algorithm that grows a tree using pre-computed motion primitives (MPs) and A* heuristics. The first feature of DE-AGT is a delayed expansion of MPs. In particular, the MPs are divided into different modes, which are ranked online. With the MP classification and prioritization, DE-AGT expands the most promising mode of MPs first, which eliminates unnecessary computation and finds solutions faster. To obtain the cost-to-go heuristic for nonholonomic articulated vehicles, we rely on supervised learning and train neural networks for fast and accurate cost-to-go prediction. The learned heuristic is used for online mode ranking and node selection. Another feature of DE-AGT is the improved goal-reaching. Exactly reaching a goal state usually requires a constant connection checking with the goal by solving steering problems -- non-trivial and time-consuming for articulated vehicles. The proposed termination scheme overcomes this challenge by tightly integrating a light-weight trajectory tracking controller with the search process. DE-AGT is implemented for autonomous parking of a general car-like tractor with 3-trailer. Simulation results show an average of 10x acceleration compared to a previous method.</p></details> |  |

However, fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set. Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module, which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities. Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to individual users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

Recent MLIPs have tended towards more complex architectures trained on larger datasets. The resulting increase in computational and memory costs may prohibit the application of these MLIPs to perform large-scale MD simulations. Here, we present a teacher-student training framework in which the latent knowledge from the teacher (atomic energies) is used to augment the students' training. We show that the light-weight student MLIPs have faster MD speeds at a fraction of the memory footprint compared to the teacher models. Remarkably, the student models can even surpass the accuracy of the teachers, even though both are trained on the same quantum chemistry dataset. Our work highlights a practical method for MLIPs to reduce the resources required for large-scale MD simulations.</p></details> |  |

The paper establishes, for small sources, the existence of solutions on the continuous and discrete level of lowest-order piecewise divergence-free Crouzeix--Raviart finite elements. The vorticity employs a vector version of the pressure space with normal and tangential velocity jump penalisation terms. A simple Raviart--Thomas interpolant leads to pressure-robust a priori error estimates. An explicit residual-based a posteriori error estimate allows for efficient and reliable a posteriori error control. The efficiency for the Forchheimer nonlinearity requires a novel discrete inequality of independent interest. The implementation is based upon a light-weight forest-of-trees data structure handled by a highly parallel set of adaptive {mesh refining} algorithms. Numerical simulations reveal robustness of the a posteriori error estimates and improved convergence rates by adaptive mesh-refining.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPU Acceleration of SQL Analytics on Compressed Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10092v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPUs are uniquely suited to accelerate (SQL) analytics workloads thanks to their massive compute parallelism and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) -- when datasets fit in the GPU HBM, performance is unparalleled. Unfortunately, GPU HBMs remain typically small when compared with lower-bandwidth CPU main memory. Besides brute-force scaling across many GPUs, current solutions to accelerate queries on large datasets include leveraging data partitioning and loading smaller data batches in GPU HBM, and hybrid execution with a connected device (e.g., CPUs). Unfortunately, these approaches are exposed to the limitations of lower main memory and host-to-device interconnect bandwidths, introduce additional I/O overheads, or incur higher costs. This is a substantial problem when trying to scale adoption of GPUs on larger datasets. Data compression can alleviate this bottleneck, but to avoid paying for costly decompression/decoding, an ideal solution must include computation primitives to operate directly on data in compressed form. This is the focus of our paper: a set of new methods for running queries directly on light-weight compressed data using schemes such as Run-Length Encoding (RLE), index encoding, bit-width reductions, and dictionary encoding. Our novelty includes operating on multiple RLE columns without decompression, handling heterogeneous column encodings, and leveraging PyTorch tensor operations for portability across devices. Experimental evaluations show speedups of an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art commercial CPU-only analytics systems, for real-world queries on a production dataset that would not fit into GPU memory uncompressed. This work paves the road for GPU adoption in a much broader set of use cases, and it is complementary to most other scale-out or fallback mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpikeSMOKE: Spiking Neural Networks for Monocular 3D Object Detection with Cross-Scale Gated Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07737v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low energy consumption for 3D object detection is an important research area because of the increasing energy consumption with their wide application in fields such as autonomous driving. The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with low-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this research. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose the SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power monocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will generate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared with the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue, inspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose a cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature representation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated filtering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the speed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can maintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection performance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection, the proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2, Moderate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by AP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively. It is important to note that the results of SpikeSMOKE can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to the results on SMOKE. For example,the energy consumption can be reduced by 72.2% on the hard category, while the detection performance is reduced by only 4%. SpikeSMOKE-L (lightweight) can further reduce the amount of parameters by 3 times and computation by 10 times compared to SMOKE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis of Anonymous User Interaction Relationships and Prediction of Advertising Feedback Based on Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13787v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While online advertising is highly dependent on implicit interaction networks of anonymous users for engagement inference, and for the selection and optimization of delivery strategies, existing graph models seldom can capture the multi-scale temporal, semantic and higher-order dependency features of these interaction networks, thus it's hard to describe the complicated patterns of the anonymous behavior. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Temporal-Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (DTH-GNN), which achieves three main contributions. Above all, we introduce temporal edge decomposition, which divides each interaction into three types of channels: short-term burst, diurnal cycle and long-range memory, and conducts feature extraction using the convolution kernel of parallel dilated residuals; Furthermore, our model builds a hierarchical heterogeneous aggregation, where user-user, user-advertisement, advertisement-advertisement subgraphs are combined through the meta-path conditional Transformer encoder, where the noise structure is dynamically tamped down via the synergy of cross-channel self-attention and gating relationship selector. Thirdly, the contrast regularity of feedback perception is formulated, the consistency of various time slices is maximized, the entropy of control exposure information with dual-view target is maximized, the global prototype of dual-momentum queue distillation is presented, and the strategy gradient layer with light weight is combined with delaying transformation signal to fine-tune the node representation for benefit-oriented. The AUC of DTH-GNN improved by 8.2% and the logarithmic loss improved by 5.7% in comparison with the best baseline model.</p></details> |  |

However, FPGA deployment is significantly resource-expensive, as associated with large number of computations in training agents with high-quality images and possess new challenges. In this work, we propose QForce-RL takes benefits of quantization to enhance throughput and reduce energy footprint with light-weight RL architecture, without significant performance degradation. QForce-RL takes advantages from E2HRL to reduce overall RL actions to learn desired policy and QuaRL for quantization based SIMD for hardware acceleration. We have also provided detailed analysis for different RL environments, with emphasis on model size, parameters, and accelerated compute ops. The architecture is scalable for resource-constrained devices and provide parametrized efficient deployment with flexibility in latency, throughput, power, and energy efficiency. The proposed QForce-RL provides performance enhancement up to 2.3x and better FPS - 2.6x compared to SoTA works.</p></details> |  |
| **[DISC: Plug-and-Play Decoding Intervention with Similarity of Characters for Chinese Spelling Check](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12863v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One key characteristic of the Chinese spelling check (CSC) task is that incorrect characters are usually similar to the correct ones in either phonetics or glyph. To accommodate this, previous works usually leverage confusion sets, which suffer from two problems, i.e., difficulty in determining which character pairs to include and lack of probabilities to distinguish items in the set. In this paper, we propose a light-weight plug-and-play DISC (i.e., decoding intervention with similarity of characters) module for CSC models.DISC measures phonetic and glyph similarities between characters and incorporates this similarity information only during the inference phase. This method can be easily integrated into various existing CSC models, such as ReaLiSe, SCOPE, and ReLM, without additional training costs. Experiments on three CSC benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves model performance, approaching and even surpassing the current state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |

We propose an online-trained neural cache that stores visibility between lights and 3D positions. We feed light visibility to weighted reservoir sampling (WRS) to sample a light source. The cache is implemented as a fully-fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multi-resolution hash-grid encoding, enabling online training and efficient inference on modern GPUs in real-time frame rates. The cache can be seamlessly integrated into existing rendering frameworks and can be used in combination with other real-time techniques such as spatiotemporal reservoir sampling (ReSTIR).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Poisson-Guided Decomposition Network for Extreme Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04470v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority. In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy under ambient illumination.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures and 1 table</p></details> |

However, significant aerial phase force (e.g., thrust and drag) can invalidate this assumption and lead to poor estimation performance. To combat this issue, a group has implemented multiple sensors (active and passive optical, inertial, and contact) and significant computational power to achieve full state estimation. This, however, poses a significant challenge to the development of light-weight, high-performance, low observable, jamming and electronic interference resistant hopping systems; especially in perceptually degraded environments (e.g., dust, smoke). Here we show a training procedure for a coupled hopping phase and Kalman filter-based vertical state estimator, requiring only inertial measurements, which is able to learn the characteristics of the target system, sensors, locomotion behaviors, environment, and acceleration measurement aliasing conditions. The resulting estimator, given hop heights up to 4 m and velocities up to $\pm7$ m/s, achieves a mean absolute percent error in the hop apex height of 12.5% with an aerial trajectory average normalized mean absolute error in position and velocity of 19% and 16.5%, respectively; while operating at 840 Hz, on a dual-core 240 MHz processor, with a total robot mass of 672 g. Due to the low mass and computational power, the presented estimator could also be used as a degraded operational mode in cases of sensor damage, malfunction, or occlusion in more complex robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |

Existing prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM) that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL. Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures(Excluding the appendix)</p></details> |
| **[MOS: Model Surgery for Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09441v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continually acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting old ones. Despite Pre-trained Models (PTMs) have shown excellent performance in CIL, catastrophic forgetting still occurs as the model learns new concepts. Existing work seeks to utilize lightweight components to adjust the PTM, while the forgetting phenomenon still comes from {\em parameter and retrieval} levels. Specifically, iterative updates of the model result in parameter drift, while mistakenly retrieving irrelevant modules leads to the mismatch during inference. To this end, we propose MOdel Surgery (MOS) to rescue the model from forgetting previous knowledge. By training task-specific adapters, we continually adjust the PTM to downstream tasks. To mitigate parameter-level forgetting, we present an adapter merging approach to learn task-specific adapters, which aims to bridge the gap between different components while reserve task-specific information. Besides, to address retrieval-level forgetting, we introduce a training-free self-refined adapter retrieval mechanism during inference, which leverages the model's inherent ability for better adapter retrieval. By jointly rectifying the model with those steps, MOS can robustly resist catastrophic forgetting in the learning process. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate MOS's state-of-the-art performance.

Recently, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, like prompt pool-based approaches and adapter tuning, have shown great attraction in CIL. However, these methods either introduce additional parameters that increase memory usage, or rely on rigid regularization techniques which reduce forgetting but compromise model flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Elastic Knowledge Preservation and Compensation (EKPC) method, integrating Importance-aware Parameter Regularization (IPR) and Trainable Semantic Drift Compensation (TSDC) for CIL. Specifically, the IPR method assesses the sensitivity of network parameters to prior tasks using a novel parameter-importance algorithm. It then selectively constrains updates within the shared adapter according to these importance values, thereby preserving previously acquired knowledge while maintaining the model's flexibility. However, it still exhibits slight semantic differences in previous knowledge to accommodate new incremental tasks, leading to decision boundaries confusion in classifier. To eliminate this confusion, TSDC trains a unified classifier by compensating prototypes with trainable semantic drift. Extensive experiments on five CIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing superior performances to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Honey types of different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits, thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers' interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation. Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB) algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of most CIL methods by 1-7\%.</p></details> |  |

Most hyperbolic feature augmentation is confined to closed-environment, assuming the number of classes is fixed (\emph{i.e.}, seen classes) and generating features only for these classes. In this paper, we propose a hyperbolic dual feature augmentation method for open-environment, which augments features for both seen and unseen classes in the hyperbolic space. To obtain a more precise approximation of the real data distribution for efficient training, (1) we adopt a neural ordinary differential equation module, enhanced by meta-learning, estimating the feature distributions of both seen and unseen classes; (2) we then introduce a regularizer to preserve the latent hierarchical structures of data in the hyperbolic space; (3) we also derive an upper bound for the hyperbolic dual augmentation loss, allowing us to train a hyperbolic model using infinite augmentations for seen and unseen classes. Extensive experiments on five open-environment tasks: class-incremental learning, few-shot open-set recognition, few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, and general image classification, demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the performance of hyperbolic algorithms in open-environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2207.03824, arXiv:2304.11855 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Neural Collapse Detection Transformer for Class Incremental Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08562v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, object detection models have witnessed notable performance improvements, particularly with transformer-based models. However, new objects frequently appear in the real world, requiring detection models to continually learn without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. Although Incremental Object Detection (IOD) has emerged to address this challenge, these existing models are still not practical due to their limited performance and prolonged inference time. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for IOD, called Hier-DETR: Hierarchical Neural Collapse Detection Transformer, ensuring both efficiency and competitive performance by leveraging Neural Collapse for imbalance dataset and Hierarchical relation of classes' labels.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPFormer: Dynamic Prompt Transformer for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07414v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In continual learning, solving the catastrophic forgetting problem may make the models fall into the stability-plasticity dilemma. Moreover, inter-task confusion will also occur due to the lack of knowledge exchanges between different tasks. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel dynamic prompt transformer (DPFormer) with prompt schemes. The prompt schemes help the DPFormer memorize learned knowledge of previous classes and tasks, and keep on learning new knowledge from new classes and tasks under a single network structure with a nearly fixed number of model parameters. Moreover, they also provide discrepant information to represent different tasks to solve the inter-task confusion problem. Based on prompt schemes, a unified classification module with the binary cross entropy loss, the knowledge distillation loss and the auxiliary loss is proposed to train the whole model in an end-to-end trainable manner. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves the best performance in the CIFAR-100, ImageNet100 and ImageNet1K datasets under different class-incremental settings in continual learning. The source code will be available at our GitHub after acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample Compression for Self Certified Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10503v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning algorithms aim to learn from a sequence of tasks, making the training distribution non-stationary. The majority of existing continual learning approaches in the literature rely on heuristics and do not provide learning guarantees. In this paper, we present a new method called Continual Pick-to-Learn (CoP2L), which is able to retain the most representative samples for each task in an efficient way. CoP2L combines the Pick-to-Learn algorithm (rooted in the sample compression theory) and the experience replay continual learning scheme. This allows us to provide non-vacuous upper bounds on the generalization loss of the learned predictors, numerically computable after each task. We empirically evaluate our approach on several standard continual learning benchmarks across Class-Incremental, Task-Incremental, and Domain-Incremental settings. Our results show that CoP2L is highly competitive across all setups, often outperforming existing baselines, and significantly mitigating catastrophic forgetting compared to vanilla experience replay in the Class-Incremental setting. It is possible to leverage the bounds provided by CoP2L in practical scenarios to certify the predictor reliability on previously learned tasks, in order to improve the trustworthiness of the continual learning algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tripartite Weight-Space Ensemble for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15720v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) enables the continual learning of new concepts with only a few training examples. In FSCIL, the model undergoes substantial updates, making it prone to forgetting previous concepts and overfitting to the limited new examples. Most recent trend is typically to disentangle the learning of the representation from the classification head of the model. A well-generalized feature extractor on the base classes (many examples and many classes) is learned, and then fixed during incremental learning. Arguing that the fixed feature extractor restricts the model's adaptability to new classes, we introduce a novel FSCIL method to effectively address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. Our method enables to seamlessly update the entire model with a few examples. We mainly propose a tripartite weight-space ensemble (Tri-WE). Tri-WE interpolates the base, immediately previous, and current models in weight-space, especially for the classification heads of the models. Then, it collaboratively maintains knowledge from the base and previous models. In addition, we recognize the challenges of distilling generalized representations from the previous model from scarce data. Hence, we suggest a regularization loss term using amplified data knowledge distillation. Simply intermixing the few-shot data, we can produce richer data enabling the distillation of critical knowledge from the previous model. Consequently, we attain state-of-the-art results on the miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100 datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

The proposed method eliminates the limitations of exemplar selection in replay-based approaches for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in federated continual learning (FCL). The limitations particularly related to the heterogeneity of information density of each summarized data. Our approach maintains the consistency of training gradients and the relationship to past tasks for the summarized exemplars to represent the streaming data compared to the original images effectively. Additionally, our approach reduces the information-level heterogeneity of the summarized data by inter-client sharing of the disentanglement generative model. Extensive experiments show that our ECoral outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and can be seamlessly integrated with many existing approaches to enhance performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class Incremental Learning for Algorithm Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01545v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithm selection is commonly used to predict the best solver from a portfolio per per-instance. In many real scenarios, instances arrive in a stream: new instances become available over time, while the number of class labels can also grow as new data distributions arrive downstream. As a result, the classification model needs to be periodically updated to reflect additional solvers without catastrophic forgetting of past data. In machine-learning (ML), this is referred to as Class Incremental Learning (CIL). While commonly addressed in ML settings, its relevance to algorithm-selection in optimisation has not been previously studied. Using a bin-packing dataset, we benchmark 8 continual learning methods with respect to their ability to withstand catastrophic forgetting. We find that rehearsal-based methods significantly outperform other CIL methods. While there is evidence of forgetting, the loss is small at around 7%. Hence, these methods appear to be a viable approach to continual learning in streaming optimisation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at GECCO 2025. 4 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[L3A: Label-Augmented Analytic Adaptation for Multi-Label Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00816v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes continually without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Multi-label CIL (MLCIL) extends CIL to a real-world scenario where each sample may belong to multiple classes, introducing several challenges: label absence, which leads to incomplete historical information due to missing labels, and class imbalance, which results in the model bias toward majority classes. To address these challenges, we propose Label-Augmented Analytic Adaptation (L3A), an exemplar-free approach without storing past samples. L3A integrates two key modules. The pseudo-label (PL) module implements label augmentation by generating pseudo-labels for current phase samples, addressing the label absence problem. The weighted analytic classifier (WAC) derives a closed-form solution for neural networks. It introduces sample-specific weights to adaptively balance the class contribution and mitigate class imbalance. Experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that L3A outperforms existing methods in MLCIL tasks.

| **[Flashbacks to Harmonize Stability and Plasticity in Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00477v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Flashback Learning (FL), a novel method designed to harmonize the stability and plasticity of models in Continual Learning (CL). Unlike prior approaches that primarily focus on regularizing model updates to preserve old information while learning new concepts, FL explicitly balances this trade-off through a bidirectional form of regularization. This approach effectively guides the model to swiftly incorporate new knowledge while actively retaining its old knowledge. FL operates through a two-phase training process and can be seamlessly integrated into various CL methods, including replay, parameter regularization, distillation, and dynamic architecture techniques. In designing FL, we use two distinct knowledge bases: one to enhance plasticity and another to improve stability. FL ensures a more balanced model by utilizing both knowledge bases to regularize model updates. Theoretically, we analyze how the FL mechanism enhances the stability-plasticity balance. Empirically, FL demonstrates tangible improvements over baseline methods within the same training budget. By integrating FL into at least one representative baseline from each CL category, we observed an average accuracy improvement of up to 4.91% in Class-Incremental and 3.51% in Task-Incremental settings on standard image classification benchmarks. Additionally, measurements of the stability-to-plasticity ratio confirm that FL effectively enhances this balance. FL also outperforms state-of-the-art CL methods on more challenging datasets like ImageNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to Neural Networks (Elsevier) in August 2024; and accepted in May 2025 for publication.

Recently, pre-trained models (PTMs) combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) have shown remarkable performance in rehearsal-free CIL without requiring exemplars from previous tasks. However, existing adapter-based methods, which incorporate lightweight learnable modules into PTMs for CIL, create new adapters for each new task, leading to both parameter redundancy and failure to leverage shared knowledge across tasks. In this work, we propose ContinuaL Low-Rank Adaptation (CL-LoRA), which introduces a novel dual-adapter architecture combining \textbf{task-shared adapters} to learn cross-task knowledge and \textbf{task-specific adapters} to capture unique features of each new task. Specifically, the shared adapters utilize random orthogonal matrices and leverage knowledge distillation with gradient reassignment to preserve essential shared knowledge. In addition, we introduce learnable block-wise weights for task-specific adapters, which mitigate inter-task interference while maintaining the model's plasticity. We demonstrate CL-LoRA consistently achieves promising performance under multiple benchmarks with reduced training and inference computation, establishing a more efficient and scalable paradigm for continual learning with pre-trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Buffer-free Class-Incremental Learning with Out-of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23412v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) poses significant challenges in open-world scenarios, where models must not only learn new classes over time without forgetting previous ones but also handle inputs from unknown classes that a closed-set model would misclassify. Recent works address both issues by (i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework, and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets support our findings, offering new insights into the design of efficient and privacy-preserving CIL systems for open-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[IRS: Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22855v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is rapidly emerging as a key focus in computer vision, aiming to develop AI systems capable of continuous improvement, thereby enhancing their value and practicality in diverse real-world applications. In healthcare, continual learning holds great promise for continuously acquired digital pathology data, which is collected in hospitals on a daily basis. However, panoramic segmentation on digital whole slide images (WSIs) presents significant challenges, as it is often infeasible to obtain comprehensive annotations for all potential objects, spanning from coarse structures (e.g., regions and unit objects) to fine structures (e.g., cells). This results in temporally and partially annotated data, posing a major challenge in developing a holistic segmentation framework. Moreover, an ideal segmentation model should incorporate new phenotypes, unseen diseases, and diverse populations, making this task even more complex. In this paper, we introduce a novel and unified Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation (IRS) learning scheme to address temporally acquired, partially annotated data while maintaining out-of-distribution (OOD) continual learning capacity in digital pathology. The key innovation of IRS lies in its ability to realize a new spatial-temporal OOD continual learning paradigm by mathematically modeling anatomical relationships between existing and newly introduced classes through a simple incremental universal proposition matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that the IRS method effectively handles the multi-scale nature of pathological segmentation, enabling precise kidney segmentation across various structures (regions, units, and cells) as well as OOD disease lesions at multiple magnifications. This capability significantly enhances domain generalization, making IRS a robust approach for real-world digital pathology applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Granularity Class Prototype Topology Distillation for Class-Incremental Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16064v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the Class-Incremental Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-SFUDA) problem, where the unlabeled target data come incrementally without access to labeled source instances. This problem poses two challenges, the interference of similar source-class knowledge in target-class representation learning and the shocks of new target knowledge to old ones. To address them, we propose the Multi-Granularity Class Prototype Topology Distillation (GROTO) algorithm, which effectively transfers the source knowledge to the class-incremental target domain. Concretely, we design the multi-granularity class prototype self-organization module and the prototype topology distillation module. First, we mine the positive classes by modeling accumulation distributions. Next, we introduce multi-granularity class prototypes to generate reliable pseudo-labels, and exploit them to promote the positive-class target feature self-organization. Second, the positive-class prototypes are leveraged to construct the topological structures of source and target feature spaces.
