| **[GraphGeo: Multi-Agent Debate Framework for Visual Geo-localization with Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00908v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual geo-localization requires extensive geographic knowledge and sophisticated reasoning to determine image locations without GPS metadata. Traditional retrieval methods are constrained by database coverage and quality. Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) enable direct location reasoning from image content, yet individual models struggle with diverse geographic regions and complex scenes. Existing multi-agent systems improve performance through model collaboration but treat all agent interactions uniformly. They lack mechanisms to handle conflicting predictions effectively. We propose \textbf{GraphGeo}, a multi-agent debate framework using heterogeneous graph neural networks for visual geo-localization. Our approach models diverse debate relationships through typed edges, distinguishing supportive collaboration, competitive argumentation, and knowledge transfer. We introduce a dual-level debate mechanism combining node-level refinement and edge-level argumentation modeling. A cross-level topology refinement strategy enables co-evolution between graph structure and agent representations. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate GraphGeo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our framework transforms cognitive conflicts between agents into enhanced geo-localization accuracy through structured debate.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission has been withdrawn by the authors due to a fundamental error in the methodology that affects the validity of the main results</p></details> |

Due to limitations in available data and increased learning complexity, previous methods tend to ignore hand motions, limiting the realism and expressivity of the interactions. Additionally, current diffusion-based approaches generate entire motion sequences simultaneously, limiting their ability to capture the reactive and adaptive nature of human interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce Interact2Ar, the first end-to-end text-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model for generating full-body, human-human interactions. Interact2Ar incorporates detailed hand kinematics through dedicated parallel branches, enabling high-fidelity full-body generation. Furthermore, we introduce an autoregressive pipeline coupled with a novel memory technique that facilitates adaptation to the inherent variability of human interactions using efficient large context windows. The adaptability of our model enables a series of downstream applications, including temporal motion composition, real-time adaptation to disturbances, and extension beyond dyadic to multi-person scenarios. To validate the generated motions, we introduce a set of robust evaluators and extended metrics designed specifically for assessing full-body interactions. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Interact2Ar.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pabloruizponce.com/papers/Interact2Ar</p></details> |
| **[Discrete Diffusion VLA: Bringing Discrete Diffusion to Action Decoding in Vision-Language-Action Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20072v3)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to map images and instructions into robot actions. However, prevailing VLAs either generate actions auto-regressively in a fixed left-to-right order or attach separate MLP or diffusion heads outside the backbone, leading to fragmented information pathways and specialized training requirements that hinder a unified, scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a unified-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion. The design retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones and uses secondary re-masking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This unified decoder preserves pre-trained vision-language priors, supports parallel decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. success rates on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv-Fractal and 54.2% overall on SimplerEnv-Bridge. We also provide ablation study on vision-language ability retention on LIBERO-OOD (Out-of-Distribution) benchmark, with our method improving over autoregressive, MLP decoder and continuous diffusion baselines. These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion VLA supports precise action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets.

| **[WorldWarp: Propagating 3D Geometry with Asynchronous Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19678v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating long-range, geometrically consistent video presents a fundamental dilemma: while consistency demands strict adherence to 3D geometry in pixel space, state-of-the-art generative models operate most effectively in a camera-conditioned latent space. This disconnect causes current methods to struggle with occluded areas and complex camera trajectories. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldWarp, a framework that couples a 3D structural anchor with a 2D generative refiner. To establish geometric grounding, WorldWarp maintains an online 3D geometric cache built via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly warping historical content into novel views, this cache acts as a structural scaffold, ensuring each new frame respects prior geometry. However, static warping inevitably leaves holes and artifacts due to occlusions. We address this using a Spatio-Temporal Diffusion (ST-Diff) model designed for a "fill-and-revise" objective. Our key innovation is a spatio-temporal varying noise schedule: blank regions receive full noise to trigger generation, while warped regions receive partial noise to enable refinement. By dynamically updating the 3D cache at every step, WorldWarp maintains consistency across video chunks. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art fidelity by ensuring that 3D logic guides structure while diffusion logic perfects texture.

| **[Efficient Vision Mamba for MRI Super-Resolution via Hybrid Selective Scanning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19676v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: High-resolution MRI is critical for diagnosis, but long acquisition times limit clinical use. Super-resolution (SR) can enhance resolution post-scan, yet existing deep learning methods face fidelity-efficiency trade-offs. Purpose: To develop a computationally efficient and accurate deep learning framework for MRI SR that preserves anatomical detail for clinical integration. Materials and Methods: We propose a novel SR framework combining multi-head selective state-space models (MHSSM) with a lightweight channel MLP. The model uses 2D patch extraction with hybrid scanning to capture long-range dependencies. Each MambaFormer block integrates MHSSM, depthwise convolutions, and gated channel mixing. Evaluation used 7T brain T1 MP2RAGE maps (n=142) and 1.5T prostate T2w MRI (n=334). Comparisons included Bicubic interpolation, GANs (CycleGAN, Pix2pix, SPSR), transformers (SwinIR), Mamba (MambaIR), and diffusion models (I2SB, Res-SRDiff). Results: Our model achieved superior performance with exceptional efficiency. For 7T brain data: SSIM=0.951+-0.021, PSNR=26.90+-1.41 dB, LPIPS=0.076+-0.022, GMSD=0.083+-0.017, significantly outperforming all baselines (p<0.001). For prostate data: SSIM=0.770+-0.049, PSNR=27.15+-2.19 dB, LPIPS=0.190+-0.095, GMSD=0.087+-0.013. The framework used only 0.9M parameters and 57 GFLOPs, reducing parameters by 99.8% and computation by 97.5% versus Res-SRDiff, while outperforming SwinIR and MambaIR in accuracy and efficiency. Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient, accurate MRI SR solution, delivering enhanced anatomical detail across datasets. Its low computational demand and state-of-the-art performance show strong potential for clinical translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDAE++: Enhancing Diffusion Models Towards Unified Generative and Discriminative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10999v3)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at image synthesis, useful representations have been shown to emerge from generative pre-training, suggesting a path towards unified generative and discriminative learning. However, suboptimal semantic flow within current architectures can hinder this potential: features encoding the richest high-level semantics are underutilized and diluted when propagating through decoding layers, impeding the formation of an explicit semantic bottleneck layer. To address this, we introduce self-conditioning, a lightweight mechanism that reshapes the model's layer-wise semantic hierarchy without external guidance. By aggregating and rerouting intermediate features to guide subsequent decoding layers, our method concentrates more high-level semantics, concurrently strengthening global generative guidance and forming more discriminative representations. This simple approach yields a dual-improvement trend across pixel-space UNet, UViT and latent-space DiT models with minimal overhead. Crucially, it creates an architectural semantic bridge that propagates discriminative improvements into generation and accommodates further techniques such as contrastive self-distillation. Experiments show that our enhanced models, especially self-conditioned DiT, are powerful dual learners that yield strong and transferable representations on image and dense classification tasks, surpassing various generative self-supervised models in linear probing while also improving or maintaining high generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version.

Most of existing works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes. Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed, existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse objects and scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 3DV 2026.

This paper investigates diffusion-based generative modeling to address these challenges through plant image synthesis, indoor-to-outdoor translation, and expert preference aligned fine tuning. First, a Stable Diffusion model is fine tuned on captioned indoor and outdoor plant imagery to generate realistic, text conditioned images of canola and soybean. Evaluation using Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance, and downstream phenotype classification shows that synthetic images effectively augment training data and improve accuracy. Second, we bridge the gap between high resolution indoor datasets and limited outdoor imagery using DreamBooth-based text inversion and image guided diffusion, generating translated images that enhance weed detection and classification with YOLOv8. Finally, a preference guided fine tuning framework trains a reward model on expert scores and applies reward weighted updates to produce more stable and expert aligned outputs. Together, these components demonstrate a practical pathway toward data efficient generative pipelines for agricultural AI.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, among open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile, underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models. Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data, code, and leaderboard results are publicly available on our website.</p></details> |  |

Recently, deep learning-based models, especially Transformer-based large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable potential in tackling these tasks by leveraging massive open-source code data and programming language features. However, the development and deployment of such models often require expertise in both machine learning and software engineering, creating a barrier for the model adoption. In this paper, we present CodeTF, an open-source Transformer-based library for state-of-the-art Code LLMs and code intelligence. Following the principles of modular design and extensible framework, we design CodeTF with a unified interface to enable rapid access and development across different types of models, datasets and tasks. Our library supports a collection of pretrained Code LLM models and popular code benchmarks, including a standardized interface to train and serve code LLMs efficiently, and data features such as language-specific parsers and utility functions for extracting code attributes. In this paper, we describe the design principles, the architecture, key modules and components, and compare with other related library tools. Finally, we hope CodeTF is able to bridge the gap between machine learning/generative AI and software engineering, providing a comprehensive open-source solution for developers, researchers, and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

Yet, current coding benchmarks face limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility. To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems, each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced directly from 72 official contests of 14 Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted between 2023 and 2025.

Post-hoc methods (e.g., LIME, SHAP) may scale easily but suffer from instability, while supervised explanation frameworks (e.g., TED) offer stability but require prohibitive human effort to label every training instance. This paper proposes a Hybrid LRR-TED framework that addresses this dilemma through a novel "Asymmetry of Discovery." When applied to customer churn prediction, we demonstrate that automated rule learners (GLRM) excel at identifying broad "Safety Nets" (retention patterns) but struggle to capture specific "Risk Traps" (churn triggers)-a phenomenon we term the Anna Karenina Principle of Churn. By initialising the explanation matrix with automated safety rules and augmenting it with a Pareto-optimal set of just four human-defined risk rules, our approach achieves 94.00% predictive accuracy. This configuration outperforms the full 8-rule manual expert baseline while reducing human annotation effort by 50%, proposing a shift in the paradigm for Human-in-the-Loop AI: moving experts from the role of "Rule Writers" to "Exception Handlers."</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables.
