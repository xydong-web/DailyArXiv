| **[FragmentGPT: A Unified GPT Model for Fragment Growing, Linking, and Merging in Molecular Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11044v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities, and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Test-Time Training Scaling Laws for Chemical Exploration in Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19153v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical Language Models (CLMs) leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) have shown promise in de novo molecular design, yet often suffer from mode collapse, limiting their exploration capabilities. Inspired by Test-Time Training (TTT) in large language models, we propose scaling TTT for CLMs to enhance chemical space exploration. We introduce MolExp, a novel benchmark emphasizing the discovery of structurally diverse molecules with similar bioactivity, simulating real-world drug design challenges. Our results demonstrate that scaling TTT by increasing the number of independent RL agents follows a log-linear scaling law, significantly improving exploration efficiency as measured by MolExp. In contrast, increasing TTT training time yields diminishing returns, even with exploration bonuses. We further evaluate cooperative RL strategies to enhance exploration efficiency. These findings provide a scalable framework for generative molecular design, offering insights into optimizing AI-driven drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Graph Neural Networks and Dataset for Robust Olfactory Navigation in Hazard Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00455v4)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation by scent is a capability in robotic systems that is rising in demand. However, current methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address challenges in olfactory navigation, we introduce a multimodal olfaction dataset along with a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines. This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and training methods, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors, enabling them to detect more compounds and inform better hardware design. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound in critical applications such as explosives detection, narcotics screening, and search and rescue. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities. Code, models, and data are made available to the community at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/kordelfrance/olfaction-vision-language-dataset.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Quantum Generative Adversarial Autoencoders: Learning latent representations for quantum data generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16186v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce the Quantum Generative Adversarial Autoencoder (QGAA), a quantum model for generation of quantum data. The QGAA consists of two components: (a) Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) to compress quantum states, and (b) Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) to learn the latent space of the trained QAE. This approach imparts the QAE with generative capabilities. The utility of QGAA is demonstrated in two representative scenarios: (a) generation of pure entangled states, and (b) generation of parameterized molecular ground states for H$_2$ and LiH. The average errors in the energies estimated by the trained QGAA are 0.02 Ha for H$_2$ and 0.06 Ha for LiH in simulations upto 6 qubits. These results illustrate the potential of QGAA for quantum state generation, quantum chemistry, and near-term quantum machine learning applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 28 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Molecule Synthesizability with Chain-of-Reaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16084v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A well-known pitfall of molecular generative models is that they are not guaranteed to generate synthesizable molecules. There have been considerable attempts to address this problem, but given the exponentially large combinatorial space of synthesizable molecules, existing methods have shown limited coverage of the space and poor molecular optimization performance. To tackle these problems, we introduce ReaSyn, a generative framework for synthesizable projection where the model explores the neighborhood of given molecules in the synthesizable space by generating pathways that result in synthesizable analogs. To fully utilize the chemical knowledge contained in the synthetic pathways, we propose a novel perspective that views synthetic pathways akin to reasoning paths in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, we introduce the chain-of-reaction (CoR) notation that explicitly states reactants, reaction types, and intermediate products for each step in a pathway. With the CoR notation, ReaSyn can get dense supervision in every reaction step to explicitly learn chemical reaction rules during supervised training and perform step-by-step reasoning. In addition, to further enhance the reasoning capability of ReaSyn, we propose reinforcement learning (RL)-based finetuning and goal-directed test-time compute scaling tailored for synthesizable projection. ReaSyn achieves the highest reconstruction rate and pathway diversity in synthesizable molecule reconstruction and the highest optimization performance in synthesizable goal-directed molecular optimization, and significantly outperforms previous synthesizable projection methods in synthesizable hit expansion. These results highlight ReaSyn's superior ability to navigate combinatorially-large synthesizable chemical space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion with Multiple Experts for Protein Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15796v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of protein design is to generate amino acid sequences that fold into functional structures with desired properties. Prior methods combining autoregressive language models with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) struggle with long-range dependencies and suffer from an impractically large search space. We propose MCTD-ME, Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion with Multiple Experts, which integrates masked diffusion models with tree search to enable multi-token planning and efficient exploration. Unlike autoregressive planners, MCTD-ME uses biophysical-fidelity-enhanced diffusion denoising as the rollout engine, jointly revising multiple positions and scaling to large sequence spaces. It further leverages experts of varying capacities to enrich exploration, guided by a pLDDT-based masking schedule that targets low-confidence regions while preserving reliable residues. We propose a novel multi-expert selection rule (PH-UCT-ME) extends predictive-entropy UCT to expert ensembles. On the inverse folding task (CAMEO and PDB benchmarks), MCTD-ME outperforms single-expert and unguided baselines in both sequence recovery (AAR) and structural similarity (scTM), with gains increasing for longer proteins and benefiting from multi-expert guidance. More generally, the framework is model-agnostic and applicable beyond inverse folding, including de novo protein engineering and multi-objective molecular generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SubDyve: Subgraph-Driven Dynamic Propagation for Virtual Screening Enhancement Controlling False Positive](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16273v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual screening (VS) aims to identify bioactive compounds from vast chemical libraries, but remains difficult in low-label regimes where only a few actives are known. Existing methods largely rely on general-purpose molecular fingerprints and overlook class-discriminative substructures critical to bioactivity. Moreover, they consider molecules independently, limiting effectiveness in low-label regimes. We introduce SubDyve, a network-based VS framework that constructs a subgraph-aware similarity network and propagates activity signals from a small known actives. When few active compounds are available, SubDyve performs iterative seed refinement, incrementally promoting new candidates based on local false discovery rate. This strategy expands the seed set with promising candidates while controlling false positives from topological bias and overexpansion. We evaluate SubDyve on ten DUD-E targets under zero-shot conditions and on the CDK7 target with a 10-million-compound ZINC dataset. SubDyve consistently outperforms existing fingerprint or embedding-based approaches, achieving margins of up to +34.0 on the BEDROC and +24.6 on the EF1% metric.</p></details> | 33 pages, 12 figures |

| **[Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) Descriptor to Characterize Imaging Heterogeneity in Confounding Tumor Pathologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19258v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant challenge in solid tumors is reliably distinguishing confounding pathologies from malignant neoplasms on routine imaging. While radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI, many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10% improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review: npj Digital Medicine</p></details> |

| **[Graph Neural Networks with Similarity-Navigated Probabilistic Feature Copying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19084v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various graph-based tasks. However, they face some fundamental limitations: feature oversmoothing can cause node representations to become indistinguishable in deeper networks, they struggle to effectively manage heterogeneous relationships where connected nodes differ significantly, and they process entire feature vectors as indivisible units, which limits flexibility. We seek to address these limitations. We propose AxelGNN, a novel GNN architecture inspired by Axelrod's cultural dissemination model that addresses these limitations through a unified framework. AxelGNN incorporates similarity-gated probabilistic interactions that adaptively promote convergence or divergence based on node similarity, implements trait-level copying mechanisms for fine-grained feature aggregation at the segment level, and maintains global polarization to preserve node distinctiveness across multiple representation clusters. The model's bistable convergence dynamics naturally handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs within a single architecture. Extensive experiments on node classification and influence estimation benchmarks demonstrate that AxelGNN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNN methods across diverse graph structures with varying homophily-heterophily characteristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynami-CAL GraphNet: A Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network Conserving Linear and Angular Momentum for Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07373v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for predicting behaviors and inferring physical properties in natural and engineered environments. Traditional physics-based models face scalability challenges and are computationally demanding, while data-driven approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often lack physical consistency, interpretability, and generalization. In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViG-LRGC: Vision Graph Neural Networks with Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18840v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision. Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers. Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset.</p></details> | Under Review |

NeuFACO employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with entropy regularization to train a graph neural network for instance-specific heuristic guidance, which is integrated into an optimized ACO framework featuring candidate lists, restricted tour refinement, and scalable local search.

| **[EC-LDA : Label Distribution Inference Attack against Federated Graph Learning with Embedding Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15140v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for graph analysis. Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging learning framework to collaboratively train graph data from various clients. However, since clients are required to upload model parameters to the server in each round, this provides the server with an opportunity to infer each client's data privacy. In this paper, we focus on label distribution attacks(LDAs) that aim to infer the label distributions of the clients' local data. We take the first step to attack client's label distributions in FGL. Firstly, we observe that the effectiveness of LDA is closely related to the variance of node embeddings in GNNs. Next, we analyze the relation between them and we propose a new attack named EC-LDA, which significantly improves the attack effectiveness by compressing node embeddings. Thirdly, extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks across six widely used graph datasets show that EC-LDA outperforms the SOTA LDAs. For example, EC-LDA attains optimal values under both Cos-sim and JS-div evaluation metrics in the CoraFull and LastFM datasets. Finally, we explore the robustness of EC-LDA under differential privacy protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06743v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning. Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral-domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: New Perspectives in Advancing Graph Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[Global-Recent Semantic Reasoning on Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18742v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Text-Attribute Graphs (DyTAGs), characterized by time-evolving graph interactions and associated text attributes, are prevalent in real-world applications. Existing methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), mostly focus on static TAGs. Extending these existing methods to DyTAGs is challenging as they largely neglect the recent-global temporal semantics: the recent semantic dependencies among interaction texts and the global semantic evolution of nodes over time. Furthermore, applying LLMs to the abundant and evolving text in DyTAGs faces efficiency issues. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic Global-Recent Adaptive Semantic Processing (DyGRASP), a novel method that leverages LLMs and temporal GNNs to efficiently and effectively reason on DyTAGs. Specifically, we first design a node-centric implicit reasoning method together with a sliding window mechanism to efficiently capture recent temporal semantics. In addition, to capture global semantic dynamics of nodes, we leverage explicit reasoning with tailored prompts and an RNN-like chain structure to infer long-term semantics. Lastly, we intricately integrate the recent and global temporal semantics as well as the dynamic graph structural information using updating and merging layers. Extensive experiments on DyTAG benchmarks demonstrate DyGRASP's superiority, achieving up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval task. Besides, DyGRASP exhibits strong generalization across different temporal GNNs and LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABG-NAS: Adaptive Bayesian Genetic Neural Architecture Search for Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21254v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective and efficient graph representation learning is essential for enabling critical downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and subgraph search. However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures.

| **[Interaction-aware Lane-Changing Early Warning System in Congested Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18624v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane changes (LCs) in congested traffic are complex, multi-vehicle interactive events that pose significant safety concerns. Providing early warnings can enable more proactive driver assistance system and support more informed decision-making for drivers under LCs. This paper presents an interaction-aware Lane-Changing Early Warning (LCEW) system designed to issue reliable early warning signals based on future trajectory predictions. We first investigate the stochastic nature of LCs, characterized by (i) variable-size multi-vehicle interactions and (ii) the direct and indirect risks resulting from these interactions. To model these stochastic interactions, a Social Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network framework informed by mutual information (STGCNN-MI) is introduced to predict multi-vehicle trajectories. By leveraging a MI-based adjacency matrix, the framework enhances trajectory prediction accuracy while providing interpretable representations of vehicle interactions. Then, potential collisions between the LC vehicle and adjacent vehicles (direct risks) or among the non-adjacent vehicles (indirect risks) are identified using oriented bounding box detection applied to the predicted trajectories. Finally, a warning signal is generated to inform the LC driver of location of potential collisions within the predicted time window. Traffic simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate that the proposed interaction-aware LCEW improves both vehicle-level safety and overall traffic efficiency, while also promoting more natural behavioral adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GALLa: Graph Aligned Large Language Models for Improved Source Code Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04183v4)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming languages possess rich semantic information - such as data flow - that is represented by graphs and not available from the surface form of source code. Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with seven different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

Our construction builds on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes -- namely, the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET -- which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar--Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). Both the $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs adopt a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN), cascading the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation -- akin to local pooling in CNNs -- that can be performed either locally or per scale. Such pooling operations are more difficult to define in traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets and in geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, our approach extracts a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be combined with simple machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification with far fewer trainable parameters than most modern graph neural networks require. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MHSNs on three distinct problem types: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, Comments Welcome</p></details> |

Its clinical and biological heterogeneity makes diagnosis and subtype differentiation highly challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown strong potential in modeling brain connectivity, but their limited robustness, data scarcity, and lack of interpretability constrain clinical adoption. Explainable Graph Neural Networks (XGNNs) have emerged to address these barriers by combining graph-based learning with interpretability, enabling the identification of disease-relevant biomarkers, analysis of brain network disruptions, and provision of transparent insights for clinicians. This paper presents the first comprehensive review dedicated to XGNNs in dementia research. We examine their applications across Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and multi-disease diagnosis. A taxonomy of explainability methods tailored for dementia-related tasks is introduced, alongside comparisons of existing models in clinical scenarios. We also highlight challenges such as limited generalizability, underexplored domains, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for early detection. By outlining both progress and open problems, this review aims to guide future work toward trustworthy, clinically meaningful, and scalable use of XGNNs in dementia research.</p></details> |  |

Automated Anti-money laundering (AML) models, like Graph Neural Networks (GNN), can be trained to identify illicit transactions in real time. A major issue for developing such models is the lack of access to training data due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. Synthetically generated data that mimics the statistical properties of real data but preserves privacy and confidentiality has been proposed as a solution. However, training AML models on purely synthetic datasets presents its own set of challenges. This article proposes the use of hybrid datasets to augment the utility of synthetic datasets by incorporating publicly available, easily accessible, and real-world features. These additions demonstrate that hybrid datasets not only preserve privacy but also improve model utility, offering a practical pathway for financial institutions to enhance AML systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) Research Institute Annual Meeting, Las Vegas, NV, (2024)</p></details> |
| **[Estimating Heterogeneous Causal Effect on Networks via Orthogonal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18484v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating causal effects on networks is important for both scientific research and practical applications. Unlike traditional settings that assume the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), interference allows an intervention/treatment on one unit to affect the outcomes of others. Understanding both direct and spillover effects is critical in fields such as epidemiology, political science, and economics. Causal inference on networks faces two main challenges. First, causal effects are typically heterogeneous, varying with unit features and local network structure. Second, connected units often exhibit dependence due to network homophily, creating confounding between structural correlations and causal effects. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method to estimate heterogeneous direct and spillover effects on networks. The first stage uses graph neural networks to estimate nuisance components that depend on the complex network topology. In the second stage, we adjust for network confounding using these estimates and infer causal effects through a novel attention-based interference model. Our approach balances expressiveness and interpretability, enabling downstream tasks such as identifying influential neighborhoods and recovering the sign of spillover effects. We integrate the two stages using Neyman orthogonalization and cross-fitting, which ensures that errors from nuisance estimation contribute only at higher order. As a result, our causal effect estimates are robust to bias and misspecification in modeling causal effects under network dependencies.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogate models for mesh-based data, their standard autoregressive application for long-term prediction is often plagued by error accumulation and instability. To address this, we introduce MeshODENet, a general framework that synergizes the spatial reasoning of GNNs with the continuous-time modeling of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and versatility on a series of challenging structural mechanics problems, including one- and two-dimensional elastic bodies undergoing large, non-linear deformations. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in long-term predictive accuracy and stability, while achieving substantial computational speed-ups over traditional solvers. This work presents a powerful and generalizable approach for developing data-driven surrogates to accelerate the analysis and modeling of complex structural systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

While local explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped. Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study with 60 participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 20 figures, NeurIPS 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

For this, diffusion and flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source, the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the effects of CAR. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256), equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.</p></details> |  |

Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/lyra/</p></details> |

Most current approaches are constrained to limited angular ranges, predominantly focusing on frontal or near-frontal views. Moreover, although the recent emerging large-scale diffusion models have been proven robust in handling 3D scenes, they underperform on facial data, given their complex structure and the uncanny valley pitfalls. In this paper, we propose SpinMeRound, a diffusion-based approach designed to generate consistent and accurate head portraits from novel viewpoints. By leveraging a number of input views alongside an identity embedding, our method effectively synthesizes diverse viewpoints of a subject whilst robustly maintaining its unique identity features. Through experimentation, we showcase our model's generation capabilities in 360 head synthesis, while beating current state-of-the-art multiview diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures.

We develop an algorithm to minimize the Kohn-Vogelius (KV) cost function, which measures the difference between the solutions of two excitations. The inverse potential problem is recast into an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize a Kohn-Vogelius-type functional within a set of admissible potentials. We establish the well-posedness of this optimization problem by proving the existence and uniqueness of a minimizer and demonstrating its stability with respect to perturbations in the boundary data. Furthermore, we analyze the Fr\'echet differentiability of the KV functional and prove the Lipschitz continuity of its gradient. These theoretical results enable the development of a convergent conjugate gradient algorithm for numerical reconstruction. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are confirmed through several numerical examples in both one and two dimensions, including cases with noisy data.</p></details> |  |

It is also the first unified MDM that uses its understanding capabilities to improve image generation and editing results through planning and iterative self-reflection.

The underlying partial differential equations that we discretize are the Stokes$\unicode{x2013}$Onsager$\unicode{x2013}$Stefan$\unicode{x2013}$Maxwell (SOSM) equations, which model bulk momentum transport and multicomponent diffusion within ideal and non-ideal mixtures. Unlike previous approaches, the methods are straightforward to implement in two and three spatial dimensions, and allow for high-order finite element spaces to be employed. The key idea in deriving the discretization is to suitably reformulate the SOSM equations in terms of the species mass fluxes and chemical potentials, and discretize these unknown fields using stable $H(\textrm{div}) \unicode{x2013} L^2$ finite element pairs. We prove that the methods are convergent and yield a symmetric linear system for a Picard linearization of the SOSM equations, which staggers the updates for concentrations and chemical potentials. We also discuss how the proposed approach can be extended to the Newton linearization of the SOSM equations, which requires the simultaneous solution of mole fractions, chemical potentials, and other variables. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments and we present an example of a physical application involving the microfluidic non-ideal mixing of hydrocarbons.</p></details> |  |

While adversarial training enhances model robustness, it often suffers from robust overfitting and an enlarged generalization gap. Although recent work has established the convergence of adversarial training in decentralized networks, its generalization properties remain unexplored. This work presents a stability-based generalization analysis of adversarial training under the diffusion strategy for convex losses. We derive a bound showing that the generalization error grows with both the adversarial perturbation strength and the number of training steps, a finding consistent with single-agent case but novel for decentralized settings. Numerical experiments on logistic regression validate these theoretical predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Penalizing Boundary Activation for Object Completeness in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16968v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful technique for text-to-image (T2I) generation, creating high-quality, diverse images across various domains. However, a common limitation in these models is the incomplete display of objects, where fragments or missing parts undermine the model's performance in downstream applications. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the incompleteness issue and reveal that the primary factor behind incomplete object generation is the usage of RandomCrop during model training. This widely used data augmentation method, though enhances model generalization ability, disrupts object continuity during training. To address this, we propose a training-free solution that penalizes activation values at image boundaries during the early denoising steps. Our method is easily applicable to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models with minimal modifications and negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements in object integrity and image quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[A noise-robust Monte Carlo method for electric field calculations in EMC3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19178v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main codes to analyze and optimize stellarator configurations is the EMC3 code, which implements a state-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo plasma edge transport code. However, so far, a self-consistent treatment of the E x B drift is absent. This plasma drift is known to significantly impact the particle and heat distribution in the plasma edge. It is desirable to incorporate this drift into EMC3 to improve the predictive capabilities of the code. The calculation of the E x B drift requires the approximation of the electric field E, which is proportional to the gradient of the electric potential $ \varphi $. In previous work, the gradient was calculated with a least squares method based on a finite difference approximation of the electric potential. However, due to the stochastic nature of EMC3, the output plasma fields computed by the code are inherently noisy. The finite difference method further amplifies the noise, with the amplification growing as the grid size decreases. We continue from, which introduced a new noise-robust method for 1D derivatives. We extend the noise-robust method to 2D and apply it to the electric potential. We show that a PDE can be derived that describes the evolution of the electric field in case of a uniform diffusion coefficient. This PDE allows us to approximate the electric field directly with a Monte Carlo simulation, thus avoiding the need for a finite difference approximation. We illustrate the accuracy of the method and the noise robustness with a test case.</p></details> |  |

This computational cost comes from the need to resolve individual collision events in high-collisional regimes. However, in such regimes, one can approximate the high-collisional kinetic dynamics with computationally cheaper diffusion. Asymptotic-preserving schemes make use of this limit to perform simulations in these regimes, without a blow-up in computational cost as incurred by standard kinetic approaches. One such scheme is Kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo. In this paper, we present a first extension of this scheme to the two-dimensional setting and its implementation in the Eiron particle code. We then demonstrate that this implementation produces a significant speedup over kinetic simulations in high-collisional cases.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Therefore, we introduce FunCanon, a framework that converts long-horizon manipulation tasks into sequences of action chunks, each defined by an actor, verb, and object. These chunks focus policy learning on the actions themselves, rather than isolated tasks, enabling compositionality and reuse. To make policies pose-aware and category-general, we perform functional object canonicalization for functional alignment and automatic manipulation trajectory transfer, mapping objects into shared functional frames using affordance cues from large vision language models. An object centric and action centric diffusion policy FuncDiffuser trained on this aligned data naturally respects object affordances and poses, simplifying learning and improving generalization ability. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate category-level generalization, cross-task behavior reuse, and robust sim2real deployment, showing that functional canonicalization provides a strong inductive bias for scalable imitation learning in complex manipulation domains.

| **[World4RL: Diffusion World Models for Policy Refinement with Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19080v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation policies are commonly initialized through imitation learning, but their performance is limited by the scarcity and narrow coverage of expert data. Reinforcement learning can refine polices to alleviate this limitation, yet real-robot training is costly and unsafe, while training in simulators suffers from the sim-to-real gap. Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in real-world simulation, with diffusion models in particular excelling at generation. This raises the question of how diffusion model-based world models can be combined to enhance pre-trained policies in robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose World4RL, a framework that employs diffusion-based world models as high-fidelity simulators to refine pre-trained policies entirely in imagined environments for robotic manipulation. Unlike prior works that primarily employ world models for planning, our framework enables direct end-to-end policy optimization. World4RL is designed around two principles: pre-training a diffusion world model that captures diverse dynamics on multi-task datasets and refining policies entirely within a frozen world model to avoid online real-world interactions. We further design a two-hot action encoding scheme tailored for robotic manipulation and adopt diffusion backbones to improve modeling fidelity. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that World4RL provides high-fidelity environment modeling and enables consistent policy refinement, yielding significantly higher success rates compared to imitation learning and other baselines. More visualization results are available at https://world4rl.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference for Deep Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19078v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI) addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification, and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior quality.</p></details> |  |

Prior works address this limitation by employing diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain: diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient, leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360 and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality while substantially reducing training time.</p></details> |  |

This is a nontrivial extension of the TPD method [Chen et al.

Our key contributions include: (i) a semi-implicit-explicit iteration that combines proximal steps for the nonsmooth part with explicit gradient steps for the smooth part, and variable preconditioners constructed from the Hessian of a regularized objective to balance iteration count and per-iteration cost; (ii) a proof of existence and uniqueness of bounded solutions for the resulting generalized proximal operator, along with a convergent and bound-preserving Newton solver; and (iii) an adaptive step-size strategy to improve robustness and accelerate convergence under poor Lipschitz conditions of the energy derivative. Comprehensive numerical experiments spanning from 1D to 3D settings demonstrate that our method achieves superior computational efficiency compared to existing methods, highlighting its broad applicability through several challenging simulations.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

Using a structured, reason-then-estimate pipeline on street-view imagery, GPT-4o infers neighborhood poverty and tree canopy, which we embed in a quasi-experimental design evaluating the legacy of 1930s redlining. GPT-4o recovers the expected adverse socio-environmental legacy effects of redlining, with estimates statistically indistinguishable from authoritative sources, and it outperforms a conventional pixel-based segmentation baseline-consistent with the idea that holistic scene reasoning extracts higher-order information beyond object counts alone. These results position MLLMs as policy-grade instruments for neighborhood measurement and motivate broader validation across policy-evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |

A Benchmark and Systematic Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13939v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual counting is a fundamental yet challenging task, especially when users need to count objects of a specific type in complex scenes. While recent models, including class-agnostic counting models and large vision-language models (VLMs), show promise in counting tasks, their ability to perform fine-grained, intent-driven counting remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce PairTally, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate fine-grained visual counting. Each of the 681 high-resolution images in PairTally contains two object categories, requiring models to distinguish and count based on subtle differences in shape, size, color, or semantics. The dataset includes both inter-category (distinct categories) and intra-category (closely related subcategories) settings, making it suitable for rigorous evaluation of selective counting capabilities. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art models, including exemplar-based methods, language-prompted models, and large VLMs. Our results show that despite recent advances, current models struggle to reliably count what users intend, especially in fine-grained and visually ambiguous cases. PairTally provides a new foundation for diagnosing and improving fine-grained visual counting systems.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this by annotating new data and fully retraining the model is time-consuming and does not guarantee generalization to additional novel categories at test time. Instead, we propose an alternative paradigm: Given a category name, tune a compact concept embedding derived from the prompt using synthetic images and pseudo-labels generated by a text-to-image diffusion model. This embedding conditions a specialization module that refines raw overcounts from any frozen counter into accurate, category-specific estimates\textemdash without requiring real images or human annotations. We validate our approach on \textsc{Lookalikes}, a challenging new benchmark containing 1,037 images across 27 fine-grained subcategories, and show substantial improvements over strong baselines.

However, their performance in the Intelligent Traffic Surveillance (ITS) domain remains limited due to the absence of dedicated multimodal datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MITS (Multimodal Intelligent Traffic Surveillance), the first large-scale multimodal benchmark dataset specifically designed for ITS. MITS includes 170,400 independently collected real-world ITS images sourced from traffic surveillance cameras, annotated with eight main categories and 24 subcategories of ITS-specific objects and events under diverse environmental conditions. Additionally, through a systematic data generation pipeline, we generate high-quality image captions and 5 million instruction-following visual question-answer pairs, addressing five critical ITS tasks: object and event recognition, object counting, object localization, background analysis, and event reasoning. To demonstrate MITS's effectiveness, we fine-tune mainstream LMMs on this dataset, enabling the development of ITS-specific applications. Experimental results show that MITS significantly improves LMM performance in ITS applications, increasing LLaVA-1.5's performance from 0.494 to 0.905 (+83.2%), LLaVA-1.6's from 0.678 to 0.921 (+35.8%), Qwen2-VL's from 0.584 to 0.926 (+58.6%), and Qwen2.5-VL's from 0.732 to 0.930 (+27.0%). We release the dataset, code, and models as open-source, providing high-value resources to advance both ITS and LMM research.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by Image and Vision Computing</p></details> |

To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door", "approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper", etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Visual Representation Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07979v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning. We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/VIRAL/</p></details> |
| **[City Sampling for Citizens' Assemblies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07557v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In citizens' assemblies, a group of constituents is randomly selected to weigh in on policy issues. We study a two-stage sampling problem faced by practitioners in countries such as Germany, in which constituents' contact information is stored at a municipal level. As a result, practitioners can only select constituents from a bounded number of cities ex post, while ensuring equal selection probability for constituents ex ante. We develop several algorithms for this problem. Although minimizing the number of contacted cities is NP-hard, we provide a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm and an additive 1-approximation, both based on separation oracles for a linear programming formulation. Recognizing that practical objectives go beyond minimizing city count, we further introduce a simple and more interpretable greedy algorithm, which additionally satisfies an ex-post monotonicity property and achieves an additive 2-approximation. Finally, we explore a notion of ex-post proportionality, for which we propose two practical algorithms: an optimal algorithm based on column generation and integer linear programming and a simple heuristic creating particularly transparent distributions. We evaluate these algorithms on data from Germany, and plan to deploy them in cooperation with a leading nonprofit organization in this space.</p></details> |  |

This blind spot severely limits their reliability in real-world applications. To date, this capability has been largely unevaluated in complex scenarios, as existing benchmarks either feature sparse object densities or are confined to specific visual domains, failing to test models under realistic conditions. Addressing this gap, we introduce CountQA, a challenging new benchmark designed to probe this deficiency. Comprising over 1,500 question-answer pairs, CountQA features real-world images with high object density, clutter, and occlusion. We investigate this weakness by evaluating 15 prominent MLLMs on the CountQA benchmark and reveal that the top-performing model achieves a mere 42.9% accuracy, with performance declining as object counts rise. By providing a dedicated benchmark to diagnose and rectify this core weakness, CountQA paves the way for a new generation of MLLMs that are not only descriptively fluent but also numerically grounded and spatially aware. We will open-source the dataset and code upon paper acceptance to foster further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causal Lens for Evaluating Faithfulness Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18848v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer natural language explanations as an alternative to feature attribution methods for model interpretability. However, despite their plausibility, they may not reflect the model's true reasoning faithfully, which is crucial for understanding the model's true decision-making processes. Although several faithfulness metrics have been proposed, they are often evaluated in isolation, making direct, principled comparisons between them difficult. Here, we present Causal Diagnosticity, a framework that serves as a common testbed to evaluate faithfulness metrics for natural language explanations. Our framework employs the concept of diagnosticity, and uses model-editing methods to generate faithful-unfaithful explanation pairs. Our benchmark includes four tasks: fact-checking, analogy, object counting, and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate prominent faithfulness metrics, including post-hoc explanation and chain-of-thought-based methods. We find that diagnostic performance varies across tasks and models, with Filler Tokens performing best overall. Additionally, continuous metrics are generally more diagnostic than binary ones but can be sensitive to noise and model choice. Our results highlight the need for more robust faithfulness metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 22 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 (highlight)</p></details> |

In this work, we aimed to assess existing design heuristics for categorical visualization using well-established psychological knowledge. Specifically, we examine the impact of the subitizing phenomenon in cognitive psychology -- people's ability to automatically recognize a small set of objects instantly without counting -- in data visualizations. We conducted three experiments with multi-class scatterplots -- between 2 and 15 classes with varying design choices -- across three different tasks -- class estimation, correlation comparison, and clustering judgments -- to understand how performance changes as the number of classes (and therefore set size) increases. Our results indicate if the category number is smaller than six, people tend to perform well at all tasks, providing empirical evidence of subitizing in visualization. When category numbers increased, performance fell, with the magnitude of the performance change depending on task and encoding. Our study bridges the gap between heuristic guidelines and empirical evidence by applying well-established psychological theories, suggesting future opportunities for using psychological theories and constructs to characterize visualization perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[SATURN: Autoregressive Image Generation Guided by Scene Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14502v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from 56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78, outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art autoregressive fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MAPR 2025</p></details> |

We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation, where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score of 0.97.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance often degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints. These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting, transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marmot: Object-Level Self-Correction via Multi-Agent Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20054v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential solution involves employing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to construct a self-correction framework. However, these approaches heavily rely on the capabilities of the MLLMs used, often fail to account for all objects within the image, and suffer from cumulative distortions during multi-round editing processes. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting to enhance image-text alignment. First, we employ a large language model as an Object-Aware Agent to perform object-level divide-and-conquer, automatically decomposing self-correction tasks into object-centric subtasks based on image descriptions. For each subtask, we construct an Object Correction System featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism that operates exclusively on a single object's segmentation mask or the bounding boxes of object pairs, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To efficiently integrate correction results from subtasks while avoiding cumulative distortions from multi-stage editing, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother, which employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtasks, significantly improving runtime efficiency while preventing distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CountCluster: Training-Free Object Quantity Guidance with Cross-Attention Map Clustering for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10710v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose \textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at: https://github.com/JoohyeonL22/CountCluster .</p></details> | Under review |

The deployment of a SNN usually requires partitioning the network and mapping these partitions onto the hardware's processing units. However, finding optimal deployment configurations is an NP-hard problem, often addressed through optimization algorithms. While some objectives (e.g., memory utilization and chip count) are static, others (e.g., communication latency and energy efficiency) depend on the network's dynamic behavior, necessitating dynamic-aware optimization. To address this, we model SNN dynamics using an Ising-type pairwise interaction framework, bridging microscopic neuron interactions with macroscopic network behavior. We optimize deployment by exploring the parameter and configuration spaces of the Ising model. We evaluate our approach on two SNNs deployed on the sPyNNaker neuromorphic platform. Initial results suggest that the method underperforms, potentially due to the Ising model's equilibrium assumptions and the architectural complexity of real-world neuromorphic hardware, highlighting limitations in its current formulation. Update: The method proposed is with a equilibrium-dynamics SNN assumption, and the original paper does not mention this. The paper needs to be revisited and reuploaded after further experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need further experiments for conclusive results</p></details> |

| **[Improving Image Captioning Descriptiveness by Ranking and LLM-based Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11593v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-The-Art (SoTA) image captioning models are often trained on the MicroSoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) dataset, which contains human-annotated captions with an average length of approximately ten tokens. Although effective for general scene understanding, these short captions often fail to capture complex scenes and convey detailed information. Moreover, captioning models tend to exhibit bias towards the ``average'' caption, which captures only the more general aspects, thus overlooking finer details. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate richer and more informative image captions by combining the captions generated from different SoTA captioning models. Our proposed method requires no additional model training: given an image, it leverages pre-trained models from the literature to generate the initial captions, and then ranks them using a newly introduced image-text-based metric, which we name BLIPScore. Subsequently, the top two captions are fused using a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the final, more detailed description. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30k test sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of caption-image alignment and hallucination reduction according to the ALOHa, CAPTURE, and Polos metrics. A subjective study lends additional support to these results, suggesting that the captions produced by our model are generally perceived as more consistent with human judgment. By combining the strengths of diverse SoTA models, our method enhances the quality and appeal of image captions, bridging the gap between automated systems and the rich and informative nature of human-generated descriptions. This advance enables the generation of more suitable captions for the training of both vision-language and captioning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for publication in Springer Neural Computing and Applications</p></details> |
| **[Pre-training CLIP against Data Poisoning with Optimal Transport-based Matching and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18717v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are threatened by targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to massive training image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. Previous defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing performance trained on poisoned datasets.</p></details> |  |

As a key component of the transformer model, self-attention calculates the attention values by mapping the relationships among the head elements of the source and target sequence, yet there is no explicit mechanism to refine and intensify the attention values with respect to the context of the input and target sequences. Based on this intuition, we introduce a novel refine and intensify attention mechanism that is called Zoneup Dropout Injection Attention Calculation (ZoDIAC), in which the intensities of attention values in the elements of the input source and target sequences are first refined using GELU and dropout and then intensified using a proposed zoneup process which includes the injection of a learned scalar factor. Our extensive experiments show that ZoDIAC achieves statistically significant higher scores under all image captioning metrics using various feature extractors in comparison to the conventional self-attention module in the transformer model on the MS-COCO dataset. Our proposed ZoDIAC attention modules can be used as a drop-in replacement for the attention components in all transformer models. The code for our experiments is publicly available at: https://github.com/zanyarz/zodiac</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been published in IEEE AIxSET 2024 and is available conference proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models through Aligning Attention Distribution to Information Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14257v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the unidirectional masking mechanism, Decoder-Only models propagate information from left to right. LVLMs (Large Vision-Language Models) follow the same architecture, with visual information gradually integrated into semantic representations during forward propagation. Through systematic analysis, we observe that the majority of the visual information is absorbed into the semantic representations. However, the model's attention distribution does not exhibit sufficient emphasis on semantic representations. This misalignment between the attention distribution and the actual information flow undermines the model's visual understanding ability and contributes to hallucinations. To address this issue, we enhance the model's visual understanding by leveraging the core information embedded in semantic representations. Specifically, we identify attention heads that focus on core semantic representations based on their attention distributions. Then, through a two-stage optimization paradigm, we propagate the advantages of these attention heads across the entire model, aligning the attention distribution with the actual information flow. We evaluate our method on three image captioning benchmarks using five different LVLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly reducing hallucinations. Further experiments reveal a trade-off between reduced hallucinations and richer details. Notably, our method allows for manual adjustment of the model's conservativeness, enabling flexible control to meet diverse real-world requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Many models have been developed to generate these captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet, authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances, these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings.

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have achieved significant advancements, they present limitations. The inherent sequential nature of RNNs leads to sluggish training and inference times. LSTMs further struggle with retaining information from earlier sequence elements when dealing with very long se- quences. This project presents a comprehensive guide to constructing and comprehending transformer models for image captioning. Transformers employ self-attention mechanisms, capturing both short- and long-range dependencies within the data. This facilitates efficient parallelization during both training and inference phases. We leverage the well-established Transformer architecture, recognized for its effectiveness in managing sequential data, and present a meticulous methodology. Utilizing the Flickr30k dataset, we conduct data pre- processing, construct a model architecture that integrates an EfficientNetB0 CNN for fea- ture extraction, and train the model with attention mechanisms incorporated. Our approach exemplifies the utilization of parallelization for efficient training and inference. You can find the project on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLLM-Driven Semantic Identifier Generation for Generative Cross-Modal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17359v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative cross-modal retrieval, which treats retrieval as a generation task, has emerged as a promising direction with the rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In this setting, the model responds to a text query by generating an identifier corresponding to the target image. However, existing methods typically rely on manually crafted string IDs, clustering-based labels, or atomic identifiers requiring vocabulary expansion, all of which face challenges in semantic alignment or scalability.To address these limitations, we propose a vocabulary-efficient identifier generation framework that prompts MLLMs to generate Structured Semantic Identifiers from image-caption pairs. These identifiers are composed of concept-level tokens such as objects and actions, naturally aligning with the model's generation space without modifying the tokenizer. Additionally, we introduce a Rationale-Guided Supervision Strategy, prompting the model to produce a one-sentence explanation alongside each identifier serves as an auxiliary supervision signal that improves semantic grounding and reduces hallucinations during training.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate whether images can act as cultural context in multimodal translation. We introduce CaMMT, a human-curated benchmark of over 5,800 triples of images along with parallel captions in English and regional languages. Using this dataset, we evaluate five Vision Language Models (VLMs) in text-only and text+image settings. Through automatic and human evaluations, we find that visual context generally improves translation quality, especially in handling Culturally-Specific Items (CSIs), disambiguation, and correct gender marking. By releasing CaMMT, our objective is to support broader efforts to build and evaluate multimodal translation systems that are better aligned with cultural nuance and regional variations.</p></details> |  |

VCASFT leverages image captions as zero-shot prompts alongside question-answer pairs and instruction-tunes models to yield significant performance improvements. To comprehensively evaluate VCASFT, we benchmark it on ScienceQA, which consists of questions across diverse languages, subjects, and fields, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness in a variety of educational contexts. Additionally, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique on lowresource languages, we developed HiSciVQA, a dataset comprising 2,245 high-quality, hand-annotated Hindi multimodal Q&A pairs. This dataset addresses the critical need for low-resource language Q&A datasets and serves as a foundation for testing VCASFT. Additionally, we introduce a novel LLM-based evaluation scheme to evaluate VLMs on HiSciVQA which offers deeper insights into model effectiveness surpassing traditional n-gram matching accuracy metrics. We are committed to advancing the field by open-sourcing all code files and the HiSciVQA dataset for the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Describe-to-Score: Text-Guided Efficient Image Complexity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16609v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately assessing image complexity (IC) is critical for computer vision, yet most existing methods rely solely on visual features and often neglect high-level semantic information, limiting their accuracy and generalization. We introduce vision-text fusion for IC modeling. This approach integrates visual and textual semantic features, increasing representational diversity. It also reduces the complexity of the hypothesis space, which enhances both accuracy and generalization in complexity assessment. We propose the D2S (Describe-to-Score) framework, which generates image captions with a pre-trained vision-language model. We propose the feature alignment and entropy distribution alignment mechanisms, D2S guides semantic information to inform complexity assessment while bridging the gap between vision and text modalities. D2S utilizes multi-modal information during training but requires only the vision branch during inference, thereby avoiding multi-modal computational overhead and enabling efficient assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that D2S outperforms existing methods on the IC9600 dataset and maintains competitiveness on no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) benchmark, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-modal fusion in complexity-related tasks.

| **[Advancing Reference-free Evaluation of Video Captions with Factual Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16538v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video captions offer concise snapshots of actors, objects, and actions within a video, serving as valuable assets for applications such as question answering and event localization. However, acquiring human annotations for video captions is costly or even impractical, especially when dealing with diverse video domains. Existing models trained on supervised datasets face challenges in evaluating performance across different domains due to the reliance on reference-based evaluation protocols, which necessitate ground truth captions. This assumption is unrealistic for evaluating videos in the wild. To address these limitations, we propose a reference-free evaluation framework that does not require ground truth captions, focusing on factual grounding to ensure accurate assessment of caption quality. We introduce VC-Inspector, a novel caption quality evaluator that is both reference-free and factually grounded. Utilizing large language models, we generate pseudo captions of varying quality based on supervised data, which are subsequently used to train a multimodal model (i.e., Qwen2.5-VL) as the evaluator. Our approach demonstrates superior alignment with human judgments on the VATEX-Eval dataset, outperforming existing methods. The performance also generalizes to image caption datasets, Flickr8K-Expert and Flickr8K-CF, when viewing images as 1-frame videos. Overall, VC-Inspector offers a scalable and generalizable solution for evaluating the factual accuracy of video captions, paving the way for more effective and objective assessment methodologies in diverse video domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViLU: Learning Vision-Language Uncertainties for Failure Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07620v4)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations. ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found here: https://github.com/ykrmm/ViLU.</p></details> |  |
| **[RACap: Relation-Aware Prompting for Lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15883v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent retrieval-augmented image captioning methods incorporate external knowledge to compensate for the limitations in comprehending complex scenes. However, current approaches face challenges in relation modeling: (1) the representation of semantic prompts is too coarse-grained to capture fine-grained relationships; (2) these methods lack explicit modeling of image objects and their semantic relationships. To address these limitations, we propose RACap, a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning, which not only mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions, but also identifies heterogeneous objects from the image. RACap effectively retrieves structured relation features that contain heterogeneous visual information to enhance the semantic consistency and relational expressiveness. Experimental results show that RACap, with only 10.8M trainable parameters, achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORIC: Benchmarking Object Recognition in Incongruous Context for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15695v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in image caption, visual question answering, and robotics by integrating visual and textual information. However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous contexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually expected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification and hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling, which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2) CLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are likely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context. Evaluating 18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models, our results reveal significant recognition gaps, underscoring the challenges posed by contextual incongruity. This work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and encourages further research on context-aware object recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAR-TEXT: A Large-Scale SAR Image-Text Dataset Built with SAR-Narrator and Progressive Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18743v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-TEXT, a large-scale and high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To construct the SAR-TEXT dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks: image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT: SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 12.97% and 10.0% on the OSdataset_512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves significant improvements over the original CoCa models in terms of BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores. In the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that, as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets. All code, pretrained models, and the SAR-Text dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/YiguoHe/SAR-TEXT.</p></details> | IEEE Submission |

A significant portion of key information is embedded in molecular structure figures, complicating large-scale literature searches and limiting the application of large language models in fields such as biology, chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. The automatic extraction of precise chemical structures is of critical importance. However, the presence of numerous Markush structures in real-world documents, along with variations in molecular image quality, drawing styles, and noise, significantly limits the performance of existing optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) methods. We present MolParser, a novel end-to-end OCSR method that efficiently and accurately recognizes chemical structures from real-world documents, including difficult Markush structure. We use a extended SMILES encoding rule to annotate our training dataset. Under this rule, we build MolParser-7M, the largest annotated molecular image dataset to our knowledge. While utilizing a large amount of synthetic data, we employed active learning methods to incorporate substantial in-the-wild data, specifically samples cropped from real patents and scientific literature, into the training process. We trained an end-to-end molecular image captioning model, MolParser, using a curriculum learning approach. MolParser significantly outperforms classical and learning-based methods across most scenarios, with potential for broader downstream applications. The dataset is publicly available in huggingface.</p></details> |  |
| **[RePIC: Reinforced Post-Training for Personalizing Multi-Modal Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18369v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Multimodal Dataset Distillation via Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15472v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset, enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation. Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizable Geometric Image Caption Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15217v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models have various practical applications that demand strong reasoning abilities. Despite recent advancements, these models still struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from the lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric images. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically fail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this paper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation pipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized from 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from mathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key features of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization and yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution scenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of $2.8\%\text{-}4.8\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks with non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with $2.4\%\text{-}3.9\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks in MMMU.</p></details> |  |

First, we clarify that such a separation principle holds asymptotically in the number of data in a Fisherian context, and show that it holds universally, i.e. regardless of the data size, in a Bayesian context. Then, by formulating model predictive control within a Gaussian regression framework, we describe how the Bayesian separation principle can be used to derive computable, uncertainty-aware expressions for the control cost and optimal input sequence, thereby bridging direct and indirect data-driven approaches. Numerical results in both linear and nonlinear scenarios illustrate that the proposed approach outperform nominal methods that neglect uncertainty, highlighting the advantages of incorporating uncertainty in the control design process.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |

New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures.

This paper describes an implementation of a stateless, transparent voting machine (STVM). The STVM is a ballot marking device (BMD) that uses a transparent, interactive printing interface where voters can verify their paper ballots as they fill out the ballot. The transparent interface turns the paper ballot into an interactive interface. In this architecture, stateless describes the machine's boot sequence, where no information is stored or passed forward between reboots. The machine does not have a hard drive. Instead, it boots and runs from read-only media. This STVM design utilizes a Blu-ray Disc ROM (BD-R) to boot the voting software. This system's statelessness and the transparent interactive printing interface make this design the most secure BMD for voting. Unlike other voting methods, this system incorporates high usability, accessibility, and security for all voters. The STVM uses an open-source voting system that has a universally designed interface, making the system accessible for all voters independent of their ability or disability. This system can make voting safer by simultaneously addressing the issue of voters noticing a vote flip and making it difficult for a hack to persist or go unmitigated.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

An advantage of the Distribution Semantics is its suitability for implementation as a Prolog or Python library, available through two well-maintained implementations, namely ProbLog and cplint/PITA. However, current formulations of the Distribution Semantics use point-probabilities, making it difficult to express epistemic uncertainty, such as arises from, for example, hierarchical classifications from computer vision models. Belief functions generalize probability measures as non-additive capacities, and address epistemic uncertainty via interval probabilities. This paper introduces interval-based Capacity Logic Programs based on an extension of the Distribution Semantics to include belief functions, and describes properties of the new framework that make it amenable to practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)</p></details> |

However, so far, a self-consistent treatment of the E x B drift is absent. This plasma drift is known to significantly impact the particle and heat distribution in the plasma edge. It is desirable to incorporate this drift into EMC3 to improve the predictive capabilities of the code. The calculation of the E x B drift requires the approximation of the electric field E, which is proportional to the gradient of the electric potential $ \varphi $. In previous work, the gradient was calculated with a least squares method based on a finite difference approximation of the electric potential. However, due to the stochastic nature of EMC3, the output plasma fields computed by the code are inherently noisy. The finite difference method further amplifies the noise, with the amplification growing as the grid size decreases. We continue from, which introduced a new noise-robust method for 1D derivatives. We extend the noise-robust method to 2D and apply it to the electric potential. We show that a PDE can be derived that describes the evolution of the electric field in case of a uniform diffusion coefficient. This PDE allows us to approximate the electric field directly with a Monte Carlo simulation, thus avoiding the need for a finite difference approximation. We illustrate the accuracy of the method and the noise robustness with a test case.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop a taxonomy of "slop" through interviews with experts in NLP, writing, and philosophy, and propose a set of interpretable dimensions for its assessment in text. Through span-level annotation, we find that binary "slop" judgments are (somewhat) subjective, but such determinations nonetheless correlate with latent dimensions such as coherence and relevance. Our framework can be used to evaluate AI-generated text in both detection and binary preference tasks, potentially offering new insights into the linguistic and stylistic factors that contribute to quality judgments.</p></details> |  |

Current radar imaging methods, however, rely on synthetic aperture or multi-frame aggregation to improve resolution, which is impractical for small aerial, inspection, or wearable systems. We present RadarSFD, a conditional latent diffusion framework that reconstructs dense LiDAR-like point clouds from a single radar frame without motion or SAR. Our approach transfers geometric priors from a pretrained monocular depth estimator into the diffusion backbone, anchors them to radar inputs via channel-wise latent concatenation, and regularizes outputs with a dual-space objective combining latent and pixel-space losses. On the RadarHD benchmark, RadarSFD achieves 35 cm Chamfer Distance and 28 cm Modified Hausdorff Distance, improving over the single-frame RadarHD baseline (56 cm, 45 cm) and remaining competitive with multi-frame methods using 5-41 frames. Qualitative results show recovery of fine walls and narrow gaps, and experiments across new environments confirm strong generalization. Ablation studies highlight the importance of pretrained initialization, radar BEV conditioning, and the dual-space loss. Together, these results establish the first practical single-frame, no-SAR mmWave radar pipeline for dense point cloud perception in compact robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel approach to generating synthetic tabular data based on the principle of maximum entropy -- MaxEnt -- called GEM-T, for ``generative entropy maximization for tables.'' GEM-T directly captures nth-order interactions -- pairwise, third-order, etc. -- among columns of training data. In extensive testing, GEM-T matches or exceeds deep neural network approaches previously regarded as state-of-the-art in 23 of 34 publicly available datasets representing diverse subject domains (68\%). Notably, GEM-T involves orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable parameters, demonstrating that much of the information in real-world data resides in low-dimensional, potentially human-interpretable correlations, provided that the input data is appropriately transformed first. Furthermore, MaxEnt better handles heterogeneous data types (continuous vs. discrete vs. categorical), lack of local structure, and other features of tabular data. GEM-T represents a promising direction for light-weight high-performance generative models for structured data.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

Conventional manual microscopy methods suffer from time inefficiency and diagnostic inaccuracies. Existing automated detection approaches remain constrained by high deployment costs and suboptimal accuracy. While deep learning has introduced powerful paradigms to this field, persistent challenges in detecting overlapping cells and multi-scale objects hinder practical deployment. This study proposes the multi-scale YOLO (MS-YOLO), a blood cell detection model based on the YOLOv11 framework, incorporating three key architectural innovations to enhance detection performance. Specifically, the multi-scale dilated residual module (MS-DRM) replaces the original C3K2 modules to improve multi-scale discriminability; the dynamic cross-path feature enhancement module (DCFEM) enables the fusion of hierarchical features from the backbone with aggregated features from the neck to enhance feature representations; and the light adaptive-weight downsampling module (LADS) improves feature downsampling through adaptive spatial weighting while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the CBC benchmark demonstrate that MS-YOLO achieves precise detection of overlapping cells and multi-scale objects, particularly small targets such as platelets, achieving an mAP@50 of 97.4% that outperforms existing models. Further validation on the supplementary WBCDD dataset confirms its robust generalization capability. Additionally, with a lightweight architecture and real-time inference efficiency, MS-YOLO meets clinical deployment requirements, providing reliable technical support for standardized blood pathology assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There is a disagreement among the authors regarding the content and submission of the manuscript, which needs to be resolved before it can be made public</p></details> |

Recent advancements in Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation have leveraged positional conditions and textual descriptions to facilitate precise and controllable image synthesis. Despite overall progress, current L2I methods still exhibit suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose InstanceAssemble, a novel architecture that incorporates layout conditions via instance-assembling attention, enabling position control with bounding boxes (bbox) and multimodal content control including texts and additional visual content. Our method achieves flexible adaption to existing DiT-based T2I models through light-weighted LoRA modules. Additionally, we propose a Layout-to-Image benchmark, Denselayout, a comprehensive benchmark for layout-to-image generation, containing 5k images with 90k instances in total. We further introduce Layout Grounding Score (LGS), an interpretable evaluation metric to more precisely assess the accuracy of L2I generation. Experiments demonstrate that our InstanceAssemble method achieves state-of-the-art performance under complex layout conditions, while exhibiting strong compatibility with diverse style LoRA modules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Addressing these challenges requires detection methods offering both function-level precision to minimize breakage and inherent robustness against code obfuscation and URL manipulation. We introduce ByteDefender, the first system leveraging V8 engine bytecode to detect fingerprinting operations specifically at the JavaScript function level. A Transformer-based classifier, trained offline on bytecode sequences, accurately identifies functions exhibiting fingerprinting behavior. We develop and evaluate light-weight signatures derived from this model to enable low-overhead, on-device matching against function bytecode during compilation but prior to execution, which only adds a 4% (average) latency to the page load time. This mechanism facilitates targeted, real-time prevention of fingerprinting function execution, thereby preserving legitimate script functionality. Operating directly on bytecode ensures inherent resilience against common code obfuscation and URL-based evasion.

| **[Light-Weight Cross-Modal Enhancement Method with Benchmark Construction for UAV-based Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06011v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) faces severe performance degradation when applied to UAV imagery due to the domain gap from ground-level datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a complete UAV-oriented solution that combines both dataset construction and model innovation. First, we design a refined UAV-Label Engine, which efficiently resolves annotation redundancy, inconsistency, and ambiguity, enabling the generation of largescale UAV datasets. Based on this engine, we construct two new benchmarks: UAVDE-2M, with over 2.4M instances across 1,800+ categories, and UAVCAP-15K, providing rich image-text pairs for vision-language pretraining. Second, we introduce the Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement (CAGE) module, a lightweight dual-path fusion design that integrates cross-attention, adaptive gating, and global FiLM modulation for robust textvision alignment. By embedding CAGE into the YOLO-World-v2 framework, our method achieves significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency, notably improving zero-shot detection on VisDrone by +5.3 mAP while reducing parameters and GFLOPs, and demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization on SIMD. Extensive experiments and real-world UAV deployment confirm the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed solution for UAV-based OVD</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI, BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy and efficiency, while class-weighted losses enhance recall for rare VRUs. Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and RGB-to-thermal augmentation boosts recall, demonstrating the potential of multimodal detection to improve VRU safety at intersections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Light-Weight Object Recognition for Real-Time Document Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06246v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions: improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model. Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system. The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while retaining a competitive OCR quality metric.

| **[Low-Dimensional Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding via Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05748v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding (FKGE) aims to facilitate collaborative learning of entity and relation embeddings from distributed Knowledge Graphs (KGs) across multiple clients, while preserving data privacy. Training FKGE models with higher dimensions is typically favored due to their potential for achieving superior performance. However, high-dimensional embeddings present significant challenges in terms of storage resource and inference speed. Unlike traditional KG embedding methods, FKGE involves multiple client-server communication rounds, where communication efficiency is critical. Existing embedding compression methods for traditional KGs may not be directly applicable to FKGE as they often require multiple model trainings which potentially incur substantial communication costs. In this paper, we propose a light-weight component based on Knowledge Distillation (KD) which is titled FedKD and tailored specifically for FKGE methods. During client-side local training, FedKD facilitates the low-dimensional student model to mimic the score distribution of triples from the high-dimensional teacher model using KL divergence loss. Unlike traditional KD way, FedKD adaptively learns a temperature to scale the score of positive triples and separately adjusts the scores of corresponding negative triples using a predefined temperature, thereby mitigating teacher over-confidence issue. Furthermore, we dynamically adjust the weight of KD loss to optimize the training process. Extensive experiments on three datasets support the effectiveness of FedKD.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPU Acceleration of SQL Analytics on Compressed Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10092v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPUs are uniquely suited to accelerate (SQL) analytics workloads thanks to their massive compute parallelism and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) -- when datasets fit in the GPU HBM, performance is unparalleled. Unfortunately, GPU HBMs remain typically small when compared with lower-bandwidth CPU main memory. Besides brute-force scaling across many GPUs, current solutions to accelerate queries on large datasets include leveraging data partitioning and loading smaller data batches in GPU HBM, and hybrid execution with a connected device (e.g., CPUs). Unfortunately, these approaches are exposed to the limitations of lower main memory and host-to-device interconnect bandwidths, introduce additional I/O overheads, or incur higher costs. This is a substantial problem when trying to scale adoption of GPUs on larger datasets. Data compression can alleviate this bottleneck, but to avoid paying for costly decompression/decoding, an ideal solution must include computation primitives to operate directly on data in compressed form. This is the focus of our paper: a set of new methods for running queries directly on light-weight compressed data using schemes such as Run-Length Encoding (RLE), index encoding, bit-width reductions, and dictionary encoding. Our novelty includes operating on multiple RLE columns without decompression, handling heterogeneous column encodings, and leveraging PyTorch tensor operations for portability across devices. Experimental evaluations show speedups of an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art commercial CPU-only analytics systems, for real-world queries on a production dataset that would not fit into GPU memory uncompressed. This work paves the road for GPU adoption in a much broader set of use cases, and it is complementary to most other scale-out or fallback mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration, resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner, allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE). Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task, called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in fidelity and consistency.</p></details> |  |

We propose an online-trained neural cache that stores visibility between lights and 3D positions. We feed light visibility to weighted reservoir sampling (WRS) to sample a light source. The cache is implemented as a fully-fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multi-resolution hash-grid encoding, enabling online training and efficient inference on modern GPUs in real-time frame rates. The cache can be seamlessly integrated into existing rendering frameworks and can be used in combination with other real-time techniques such as spatiotemporal reservoir sampling (ReSTIR).</p></details> |  |

By only utilizing low-cost and light-weight monocular vision sensors, our system is well suited for small robots and micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). DVM-SLAM's real-world applicability is validated on physical robots with a custom collision avoidance framework, showcasing its potential in real-time multi-agent autonomous navigation scenarios. We also demonstrate comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art centralized monocular C-SLAM systems.

| **[An LLM-powered Natural-to-Robotic Language Translation Framework with Correctness Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19074v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being deployed in robotics to generate robot control programs for specific user tasks, enabling embodied intelligence. Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt design that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user tasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and the high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to tremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly undermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied. This paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i) provides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii) enhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based fine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is proposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs, bridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the RSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by the LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until being verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the LLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications. Experiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range of LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Conversely, light-weight models can be deployed on edge devices at lower cost but often with inferior generation quality for complex user prompts. To strike a balance between performance and cost, we propose a routing framework, called RouteT2I, which dynamically selects either the large cloud model or the light-weight edge model for each user prompt. Since generated image quality is challenging to measure and compare directly, RouteT2I establishes multi-dimensional quality metrics, particularly, by evaluating the similarity between the generated images and both positive and negative texts that describe each specific quality metric. RouteT2I then predicts the expected quality of the generated images by identifying key tokens in the prompt and comparing their impact on the quality. RouteT2I further introduces the Pareto relative superiority to compare the multi-metric quality of the generated images. Based on this comparison and predefined cost constraints, RouteT2I allocates prompts to either the edge or the cloud. Evaluation reveals that RouteT2I significantly reduces the number of requesting large cloud model while maintaining high-quality image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Pre-trained models (PTMs) show promising capabilities in CIL. However, existing approaches that apply lightweight fine-tuning to backbones still induce parameter drift, thereby compromising the generalization capability of pre-trained models. Parameter drift can be conceptualized as a form of noise that obscures critical patterns learned for previous tasks. However, recent researches have shown that noise is not always harmful. For example, the large number of visual patterns learned from pre-training can be easily abused by a single task, and introducing appropriate noise can suppress some low-correlation features, thus leaving a margin for future tasks. To this end, we propose learning beneficial noise for CIL guided by information theory and propose Mixture of Noise (Min), aiming to mitigate the degradation of backbone generalization from adapting new tasks. Specifically, task-specific noise is learned from high-dimension features of new tasks. Then, a set of weights is adjusted dynamically for optimal mixture of different task noise. Finally, Min embeds the beneficial noise into the intermediate features to mask the response of inefficient patterns. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that Min achieves state-of-the-art performance in most incremental settings, with particularly outstanding results in 50-steps incremental settings. This shows the significant potential for beneficial noise in continual learning.

| **[Class-wise Balancing Data Replay for Federated Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07712v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS'25 Accepted, Oral</p></details> |

This work focuses on the Coarse-To-Fine Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) task. Our study follows the Knowe approach, which contrastively learns coarse class labels and subsequently normalizes and freezes the classifier weights of learned fine classes in the embedding space. To better interpret the "coarse-to-fine" paradigm, we propose embedding the feature extractor into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ the Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space, enabling the feature extractor to transform input images into feature vectors within the Poincar\'e ball instead of Euclidean space. We further introduce hyperbolic contrastive loss and hyperbolic fully-connected layers to facilitate model optimization and classification in hyperbolic space. Additionally, to enhance performance under few-shot conditions, we implement maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic space to estimate the probability distribution of fine-class feature vectors. This allows generation of augmented features from the distribution to mitigate overfitting during training with limited samples. Experiments on C2FSCIL benchmarks show that our method effectively improves both coarse and fine class accuracies.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3D class-incremental learning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric misalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with 2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by texture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural cues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a framework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical spatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric Rectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's intermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion. Additionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal consistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.</p></details> | ICCV2025 |

However, our world constantly changes, asking ESC models to adapt to new sounds periodically. The major challenge here is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose the ability to recognize old sounds when learning new ones. Many methods address this using replay-based continual learning. This could be impractical in scenarios such as data privacy concerns. Exemplar-free methods are commonly used but can distort old features, leading to worse performance. To overcome such limitations, we propose an Acoustic Feature Transformation (AFT) technique that aligns the temporal features of old classes to the new space, including a selectively compressed feature space. AFT mitigates the forgetting of old knowledge without retaining past data. We conducted experiments on two datasets, showing consistent improvements over baseline models with accuracy gains of 3.7\% to 3.9\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Unbiased Online Curvature Approximation for Regularized Graph Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12727v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free, class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes. In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix (FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability (retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Efficient Single-Step Framework for Incremental Class Learning in Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11285v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incremental learning remains a critical challenge in machine learning, as models often struggle with catastrophic forgetting -the tendency to lose previously acquired knowledge when learning new information. These challenges are even more pronounced in resource-limited settings. Many existing Class Incremental Learning (CIL) methods achieve high accuracy by continually adapting their feature representations; however, they often require substantial computational resources and complex, iterative training procedures. This work introduces CIFNet (Class Incremental and Frugal Network), a novel CIL approach that addresses these limitations by offering a highly efficient and sustainable solution. CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several existing, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature extractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer neural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor eliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone. This, combined with a compressed buffer for efficient memory use, enables CIFNet to perform efficient class-incremental learning through a single-step optimization process on fixed features, minimizing computational overhead and training time without requiring multiple weight updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that CIFNet effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting at the classifier level, achieving high accuracy comparable to that of existing state-of-the-art methods, while substantially improving training efficiency and sustainability. CIFNet represents a significant advancement in making class-incremental learning more accessible and pragmatic in environments with limited resources, especially when strong pre-trained feature extractors are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Domain Attribute Alignment with CLIP: A Rehearsal-Free Approach for Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11264v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task. Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

| **[Uncertainty-Driven Hierarchical Sampling for Unbalanced Continual Malware Detection with Time-Series Update-Based Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07532v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android malware detection continues to face persistent challenges stemming from long-term concept drift and class imbalance, as evolving malicious behaviors and shifting usage patterns dynamically reshape feature distributions. Although continual learning (CL) mitigates drift, existing replay-based methods suffer from inherent bias. Specifically, their reliance on classifier uncertainty for sample selection disproportionately prioritizes the dominant benign class, causing overfitting and reduced generalization to evolving malware. To address these limitations, we propose a novel uncertainty-guided CL framework. First, we introduce a hierarchical balanced sampler that employs a dual-phase uncertainty strategy to dynamically balance benign and malicious samples while simultaneously selecting high-information, high-uncertainty instances within each class. This mechanism ensures class equilibrium across both replay and incremental data, thereby enhancing adaptability to emerging threats. Second, we augment the framework with a vector retrieval mechanism that exploits historical malware embeddings to identify evolved variants via similarity-based retrieval, thereby complementing classifier updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under strict low-label conditions (50 labels per phase). It achieves a true positive rate (TPR) of 92.95\% and a mean accuracy (mACC) of 94.26\%, which validates its efficacy for sustainable Android malware detection.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2025)</p></details> |

Soft-TF sequentially learns and selects an optimal soft-network for each task. During sequential training in CL, a well-initialized Soft-TF mask optimizes the weights of sparse layers to obtain task-adaptive soft (real-valued) networks, while keeping the well-pre-trained layer parameters frozen. In inference, the identified task-adaptive network of Soft-TF masks the parameters of the pre-trained network, mapping to an optimal solution for each task and minimizing Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) - the soft-masking preserves the knowledge of the pre-trained network. Extensive experiments on the Vision Transformer (ViT) and the Language Transformer (Bert) demonstrate the effectiveness of Soft-TF, achieving state-of-the-art performance across Vision and Language Class Incremental Learning (CIL) scenarios.</p></details> |  |

By abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process, and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework (LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates, while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in multi-step scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes. However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels (ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD) methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure its computational complexity to validate its suitability for resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by more than 5% in final accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[Class Incremental Continual Learning with Self-Organizing Maps and Variational Autoencoders Using Synthetic Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21240v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual learning.</p></details> |  |

Recently, replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this, exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge representations. To this end, we propose to fuse information from sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr$^2$R). More specifically, by distilling the training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the fused samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving data privacy. Specifically, Pr$^2$R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other replay-based methods, respectively.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Teaching AI to Remember: Insights from Brain-Inspired Replay in Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00047v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space, potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Memory Learning: Imitating Lifelong Remembering and Forgetting of Brain Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19183v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data in real-world scenarios undergo rapid and frequent changes, making it challenging for existing graph models to effectively handle the continuous influx of new data and accommodate data withdrawal requests. The approach to frequently retraining graph models is resource intensive and impractical. To address this pressing challenge, this paper introduces a new concept of graph memory learning. Its core idea is to enable a graph model to selectively remember new knowledge but forget old knowledge. Building on this approach, the paper presents a novel graph memory learning framework - Brain-inspired Graph Memory Learning (BGML), inspired by brain network dynamics and function-structure coupling strategies. BGML incorporates a multi-granular hierarchical progressive learning mechanism rooted in feature graph grain learning to mitigate potential conflict between memorization and forgetting in graph memory learning. This mechanism allows for a comprehensive and multi-level perception of local details within evolving graphs. In addition, to tackle the issue of unreliable structures in newly added incremental information, the paper introduces an information self-assessment ownership mechanism. This mechanism not only facilitates the propagation of incremental information within the model but also effectively preserves the integrity of past experiences. We design five types of graph memory learning tasks: regular, memory, unlearning, data-incremental, and class-incremental to evaluate BGML. Its excellent performance is confirmed through extensive experiments on multiple real-world node classification datasets.</p></details> |  |
