| **[Fast Controlled Generation from Language Models with Adaptive Weighted Rejection Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05410v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some constraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens at each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this is achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding non-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i) Evaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM vocabularies often exceed $100,000$ tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global distribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information, even if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm that addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on the full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive rejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer constraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to produce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small additional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously proposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior of local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in text-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON domains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines, supporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and performance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that our method's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation, scaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and as a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |
| **[A transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets with application to signal recovery from the second moment and cryo-EM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04354v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-algebraic priors are ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning. Prevalent examples include a) linear models where the signal lies in a low-dimensional subspace; b) sparse models where the signal can be represented by only a few coefficients under a suitable basis; and c) a large family of neural network generative models. In this paper, we prove a transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets in orthogonal or unitary representations of groups: with a suitable dimension bound, a generic translate of any semi-algebraic set is transverse to the orbits of the group action. This, in turn, implies that if a signal lies in a low-dimensional semi-algebraic set, then it can be recovered uniquely from measurements that separate orbits. As an application, we consider the implications of the transversality theorem to the problem of recovering signals that are translated by random group actions from their second moment. As a special case, we discuss cryo-EM: a leading technology to constitute the spatial structure of biological molecules, which serves as our prime motivation. In particular, we derive explicit bounds for recovering a molecular structure from the second moment under a semi-algebraic prior and deduce information-theoretic implications. We also obtain information-theoretic bounds for three additional applications: factoring Gram matrices, multi-reference alignment, and phase retrieval. Finally, we deduce bounds for designing permutation invariant separators in machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17064v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (main text), 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[FlowMol3: Flow Matching for 3D De Novo Small-Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12629v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A generative model capable of sampling realistic molecules with desired properties could accelerate chemical discovery across a wide range of applications. Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing models that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present FlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the state of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial performance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes to the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching formulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three architecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost: self-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3 achieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit hydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and geometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer learnable parameters than comparable methods. We hypothesize that these techniques mitigate a general pathology affecting transport-based generative models, enabling detection and correction of distribution drift during inference. Our results highlight simple, transferable strategies for improving the stability and quality of diffusion- and flow-based molecular generative models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Controlled Generation with Equivariant Variational Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18340v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models, or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Flow Matching for Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04843v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a formulation of flow matching as variational inference, which we refer to as variational flow matching (VFM). Based on this formulation we develop CatFlow, a flow matching method for categorical data. CatFlow is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and achieves strong results on graph generation tasks. In VFM, the objective is to approximate the posterior probability path, which is a distribution over possible end points of a trajectory. We show that VFM admits both the CatFlow objective and the original flow matching objective as special cases. We also relate VFM to score-based models, in which the dynamics are stochastic rather than deterministic, and derive a bound on the model likelihood based on a reweighted VFM objective. We evaluate CatFlow on one abstract graph generation task and two molecular generation tasks. In all cases, CatFlow exceeds or matches performance of the current state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[IBEX: Information-Bottleneck-EXplored Coarse-to-Fine Molecular Generation under Limited Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10775v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design. Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to 64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus 3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation error.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Chem3DLLM: 3D Multimodal Large Language Models for Chemistry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10696v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the real world, a molecule is a 3D geometric structure. Compared to 1D SMILES sequences and 2D molecular graphs, 3D molecules represent the most informative molecular modality. Despite the rapid progress of autoregressive-based language models, they cannot handle the generation of 3D molecular conformation due to several challenges: 1) 3D molecular structures are incompatible with LLMs' discrete token space, 2) integrating heterogeneous inputs like proteins, ligands, and text remains difficult within a unified model, and 3) LLMs lack essential scientific priors, hindering the enforcement of physical and chemical constraints during generation. To tackle these issues, we present Chem3DLLM, a unified protein-conditioned multimodal large language model. Our approach designs a novel reversible text encoding for 3D molecular structures using run-length compression, achieving 3x size reduction while preserving complete structural information. This enables seamless integration of molecular geometry with protein pocket features in a single LLM architecture. We employ reinforcement learning with stability-based rewards to optimize chemical validity and incorporate a lightweight protein embedding projector for end-to-end training. Experimental results on structure-based drug design demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with a Vina score of -7.21, validating our unified multimodal approach for practical drug discovery applications.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[$\text{M}^{2}$LLM: Multi-view Molecular Representation Learning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08657v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery. Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that $\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced reasoning processes.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |
| **[A DNN Biophysics Model with Topological and Electrostatic Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03658v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this project, we provide a deep-learning neural network (DNN) based biophysics model to predict protein properties. The model uses multi-scale and uniform topological and electrostatic features generated with protein structural information and force field, which governs the molecular mechanics. The topological features are generated using the element specified persistent homology (ESPH) while the electrostatic features are fast computed using a Cartesian treecode. These features are uniform in number for proteins with various sizes thus the broadly available protein structure database can be used in training the network. These features are also multi-scale thus the resolution and computational cost can be balanced by the users. The machine learning simulation on over 4000 protein structures shows the efficiency and fidelity of these features in representing the protein structure and force field for the predication of their biophysical properties such as electrostatic solvation energy. Tests on topological or electrostatic features alone and the combination of both showed the optimal performance when both features are used. This model shows its potential as a general tool in assisting biophysical properties and function prediction for the broad biomolecules using data from both theoretical computing and experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolSnap: Snap-Fast Molecular Generation with Latent Variational Mean Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05411v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation. Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over diffusion-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Small Step with Fingerprints, One Giant Leap for De Novo Molecule Generation from Mass Spectra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04180v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common approach to the de novo molecular generation problem from mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into molecular structures. In our work, we adopt MIST as the encoder and MolForge as the decoder, leveraging pretraining to enhance performance. Notably, pretraining MolForge proves especially effective, enabling it to serve as a robust fingerprint-to-structure decoder. Additionally, instead of passing the probability of each bit in the fingerprint, thresholding the probabilities as a step function helps focus the decoder on the presence of substructures, improving recovery of accurate molecular structures even when the fingerprints predicted by MIST only moderately resembles the ground truth in terms of Tanimoto similarity. This combination of encoder and decoder results in a tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1 28% / top-10 36% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra. We position this pipeline as a strong baseline for future research in de novo molecule elucidation from mass spectra.</p></details> |  |
| **[Potential Score Matching: Debiasing Molecular Structure Sampling with Potential Energy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14569v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolReasoner: Toward Effective and Interpretable Reasoning for Molecular LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02066v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics, while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT) samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently, Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions, thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[BSL: A Unified and Generalizable Multitask Learning Platform for Virtual Drug Discovery from Design to Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01195v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health, prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced, open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery, offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor, successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery. The platform is accessible at https://www.baishenglai.net.</p></details> |  |

Given a hierarchical representation of the environment, the objective is to navigate from a start position to a goal, while satisfying task-specific safety constraints and minimizing computational cost. We introduce Hierarchical Class-ordered A* (HCOA*), an algorithm that leverages the environment's hierarchy for efficient and safe path-planning in mixed geometric/semantic graphs. We use a total order over the semantic classes and prove theoretical performance guarantees for the algorithm. We propose three approaches for higher-layer node classification based on the semantics of the lowest layer: a Graph Neural Network method, a k-Nearest Neighbors method, and a Majority-Class method. We evaluate HCOA* in simulations on two 3D Scene Graphs, comparing it to the state-of-the-art and assessing the performance of each classification approach. Results show that HCOA* reduces the computational time of navigation by up to 50%, while maintaining near-optimal performance across a wide range of scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[GraphLand: Evaluating Graph Machine Learning Models on Diverse Industrial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14500v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although data that can be naturally represented as graphs is widespread in real-world applications across diverse industries, popular graph ML benchmarks for node property prediction only cover a surprisingly narrow set of data domains, and graph neural networks (GNNs) are often evaluated on just a few academic citation networks. This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines. Further, we evaluate currently available general-purpose graph foundation models and find that they fail to produce competitive results on our proposed datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoTO: Robust Topology Obfuscation Against Tomography Inference Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12852v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tomography inference attacks aim to reconstruct network topology by analyzing end-to-end probe delays. Existing defenses mitigate these attacks by manipulating probe delays to mislead inference, but rely on two strong assumptions: (i) probe packets can be perfectly detected and altered, and (ii) attackers use known, fixed inference algorithms. These assumptions often break in practice, leading to degraded defense performance under detection errors or adaptive adversaries. We present RoTO, a robust topology obfuscation scheme that eliminates both assumptions by modeling uncertainty in attacker-observed delays through a distributional formulation. RoTO casts the defense objective as a min-max optimization problem that maximizes expected topological distortion across this uncertainty set, without relying on perfect probe control or specific attacker models. To approximate attacker behavior, RoTO leverages graph neural networks for inference simulation and adversarial training. We also derive an upper bound on attacker success probability, and demonstrate that our approach enhances topology obfuscation performance through the optimization of this upper bound. Experimental results show that RoTO outperforms existing defense methods, achieving average improvements of 34% in structural similarity and 42.6% in link distance while maintaining strong robustness and concealment capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12840v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing significant improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to existing methods that rely on computationally intensive optimization or require multi-frame video inputs, 4DNeX enables efficient, end-to-end image-to-4D generation by fine-tuning a pretrained video diffusion model. Specifically, 1) to alleviate the scarcity of 4D data, we construct 4DNeX-10M, a large-scale dataset with high-quality 4D annotations generated using advanced reconstruction approaches. 2) we introduce a unified 6D video representation that jointly models RGB and XYZ sequences, facilitating structured learning of both appearance and geometry. 3) we propose a set of simple yet effective adaptation strategies to repurpose pretrained video diffusion models for 4D modeling. 4DNeX produces high-quality dynamic point clouds that enable novel-view video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4DNeX outperforms existing 4D generation methods in efficiency and generalizability, offering a scalable solution for image-to-4D modeling and laying the foundation for generative 4D world models that simulate dynamic scene evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://4dnex.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[MDPO: Overcoming the Training-Inference Divide of Masked Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13148v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens, whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random. Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and 54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine tokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we refer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains when combined with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.

The first two algorithms adopt a sequential strategy: at the initial time step, all variables are computed simultaneously using a monolithic solver; thereafter, the system is split into a mixed linear elasticity subproblem and a coupled pressure-temperature reaction-diffusion subproblem. The two variants differ in the order in which these subproblems are solved. To further improve computational efficiency, we introduce a parallel semi-decoupled algorithm. In this approach, the four-field system is solved monolithically only at the first time step, and the two subproblems are then solved in parallel at subsequent time levels. All three algorithms are free from stabilization techniques and do not require iterative procedures at each time step. Rigorous analysis confirms their unconditional stability, optimal convergence rates, and robustness under a wide range of physical parameter settings. These theoretical results are further validated by numerical experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be submitted to a journal</p></details> |

Inflatable structures are a prominent example, using internal pressurization to realize large, nonlinear deformations in applications ranging from soft robotics and deployable aerospace systems to biomedical devices and adaptive architecture. We present a generative design framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for the inverse design of elastic structures undergoing large, nonlinear deformations under pressure-driven actuation. The method formulates the inverse design as a conditional generation task, using geometric descriptors of target deformed states as inputs and outputting image-based representations of the undeformed configuration. Representing these configurations as simple images is achieved by establishing a pre- and postprocessing pipeline that involves a fixed image processing, simulation setup, and descriptor extraction methods. Numerical experiments with scalar and higher-dimensional descriptors show that the framework can quickly produce diverse undeformed configurations that achieve the desired deformations when inflated, enabling parallel exploration of viable design candidates while accommodating complex constraints.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |
| **[DMS:Diffusion-Based Multi-Baseline Stereo Generation for Improving Self-Supervised Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13091v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While supervised stereo matching and monocular depth estimation have advanced significantly with learning-based algorithms, self-supervised methods using stereo images as supervision signals have received relatively less focus and require further investigation. A primary challenge arises from ambiguity introduced during photometric reconstruction, particularly due to missing corresponding pixels in ill-posed regions of the target view, such as occlusions and out-of-frame areas. To address this and establish explicit photometric correspondences, we propose DMS, a model-agnostic approach that utilizes geometric priors from diffusion models to synthesize novel views along the epipolar direction, guided by directional prompts. Specifically, we finetune a Stable Diffusion model to simulate perspectives at key positions: left-left view shifted from the left camera, right-right view shifted from the right camera, along with an additional novel view between the left and right cameras. These synthesized views supplement occluded pixels, enabling explicit photometric reconstruction. Our proposed DMS is a cost-free, ''plug-and-play'' method that seamlessly enhances self-supervised stereo matching and monocular depth estimation, and relies solely on unlabeled stereo image pairs for both training and synthesizing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with up to 35% outlier reduction and state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance often degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints. These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting, transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marmot: Object-Level Self-Correction via Multi-Agent Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20054v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential solution involves employing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to construct a self-correction framework. However, these approaches heavily rely on the capabilities of the MLLMs used, often fail to account for all objects within the image, and suffer from cumulative distortions during multi-round editing processes. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting to enhance image-text alignment. First, we employ a large language model as an Object-Aware Agent to perform object-level divide-and-conquer, automatically decomposing self-correction tasks into object-centric subtasks based on image descriptions. For each subtask, we construct an Object Correction System featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism that operates exclusively on a single object's segmentation mask or the bounding boxes of object pairs, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To efficiently integrate correction results from subtasks while avoiding cumulative distortions from multi-stage editing, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother, which employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtasks, significantly improving runtime efficiency while preventing distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CountCluster: Training-Free Object Quantity Guidance with Cross-Attention Map Clustering for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10710v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose \textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity control performance across a variety of prompts.

The deployment of a SNN usually requires partitioning the network and mapping these partitions onto the hardware's processing units. However, finding optimal deployment configurations is an NP-hard problem, often addressed through optimization algorithms. While some objectives (e.g., memory utilization and chip count) are static, others (e.g., communication latency and energy efficiency) depend on the network's dynamic behavior, necessitating dynamic-aware optimization. To address this, we model SNN dynamics using an Ising-type pairwise interaction framework, bridging microscopic neuron interactions with macroscopic network behavior. We optimize deployment by exploring the parameter and configuration spaces of the Ising model. We evaluate our approach on two SNNs deployed on the sPyNNaker neuromorphic platform. Initial results suggest that the method underperforms, potentially due to the Ising model's equilibrium assumptions and the architectural complexity of real-world neuromorphic hardware, highlighting limitations in its current formulation. Update: The method proposed is with a equilibrium-dynamics SNN assumption, and the original paper does not mention this. The paper needs to be revisited and reuploaded after further experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need further experiments for conclusive results</p></details> |

While artificial intelligence(AI) tools have demonstrated promise in dermatological image analysis, current models face limitations-they often rely on large, manually labeled datasets and are built for narrow, specific tasks, making them less effective in real-world settings. To tackle these limitations, we present DermNIO, a versatile foundation model for dermatology. Trained on a curated dataset of 432,776 images from three sources (public repositories, web-sourced images, and proprietary collections), DermNIO incorporates a novel hybrid pretraining framework that augments the self-supervised learning paradigm through semi-supervised learning and knowledge-guided prototype initialization. This integrated method not only deepens the understanding of complex dermatological conditions, but also substantially enhances the generalization capability across various clinical tasks. Evaluated across 20 datasets, DermNIO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across a wide range of tasks. It excels in high-level clinical applications including malignancy classification, disease severity grading, multi-category diagnosis, and dermatological image caption, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance in low-level tasks such as skin lesion segmentation. Furthermore, DermNIO demonstrates strong robustness in privacy-preserving federated learning scenarios and across diverse skin types and sexes. In a blinded reader study with 23 dermatologists, DermNIO achieved 95.79% diagnostic accuracy (versus clinicians' 73.66%), and AI assistance improved clinician performance by 17.21%.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Are Large Pre-trained Vision Language Models Effective Construction Safety Inspectors?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11011v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets, limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques, providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2) \textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation, causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream \textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity, while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

We reconcile these disparate data sources by presenting TikZero, which decouples graphics program generation from text understanding by using image representations as an intermediary bridge. It enables independent training on graphics programs and captioned images and allows for zero-shot text-guided graphics program synthesis during inference. We show that our method substantially outperforms baselines that can only operate with caption-aligned graphics programs. Furthermore, when leveraging caption-aligned graphics programs as a complementary training signal, TikZero matches or exceeds the performance of much larger models, including commercial systems like GPT-4o.

We assume access to a sampler which allows us to draw indices proportional to the squared row/column-norms of $\mathbf{A}$. Our algorithm produces a compressed representation of some vector $\mathbf{x}$ for which $\|\mathbf{x}^* - \mathbf{x}\| < \varepsilon \|\mathbf{x}^* \|$ in $\widetilde{O}(\kappa_{\mathsf{F}}^4 \kappa^2 / \varepsilon^2)$ time, where $\kappa_{\mathsf{F}} := \|\mathbf{A}\|_{\mathsf{F}}\|\mathbf{A}^{+}\|$ and $\kappa := \|\mathbf{A}\|\|\mathbf{A}^{+}\|$. The representation of $\mathbf{x}$ allows us to query entries of $\mathbf{x}$ in $\widetilde{O}(\kappa_{\mathsf{F}}^2)$ time and sample proportional to the square entries of $\mathbf{x}$ in $\widetilde{O}(\kappa_{\mathsf{F}}^4 \kappa^6)$ time, assuming access to a sampler which allows us to draw indices proportional to the squared entries of any given row of $\mathbf{A}$. Our analysis, which is elementary, non-asymptotic, and fully self-contained, simplifies and clarifies several past analyses from literature including [Gily\'en, Song, and Tang; 2022, 2023] and [Shao and Montanaro; 2022].</p></details> |  |

Practical bottlenecks of ABC applications include selecting statistics that summarize the data without losing too much information or introducing uncertainty, and choosing distance functions and tolerance thresholds that balance accuracy and computational efficiency. Recent studies have shown that ABC methods using random forest (RF) methodology perform well while circumventing many of ABC's drawbacks. However, RF construction is computationally expensive for large numbers of trees and model simulations, and there can be high uncertainty in the posterior if the prior distribution is uninformative. Here we further adapt random forests to the ABC setting in two ways. The first exploits distributional random forests to provide a direct method for inferring the joint posterior distribution of parameters of interest, while the second describes a sequential Monte Carlo approach which updates the prior distribution iteratively to focus on the most likely regions in the parameter space. We show that the new methods can accurately infer posterior distributions for a wide range of deterministic and stochastic models in different scientific areas.</p></details> |  |

However, current works treat different tools as isolated components and fail to leverage the inherent dependencies of tools, leading to invalid planning results. Since tool dependencies are often incomplete, it becomes challenging for LLMs to accurately identify the appropriate tools required by a user request, especially when confronted with a large toolset. To solve this challenge, we propose \texttt{GTool}, which is the first work aiming to enhance the tool planning ability of LLMs under incomplete dependencies. \texttt{GTool} constructs a request-specific tool graph to select tools efficiently and generate the \texttt{<graph token>} which provides sufficient dependency information understandable by LLMs. Moreover, a missing dependency prediction task is designed to improve the reliability of \texttt{GTool} with incomplete dependencies. Without trimming LLMs, \texttt{GTool} can be seamlessly integrated with various LLM backbones without extensive retraining. Extensive experiments show that \texttt{GTool} achieves more than 29.6\% performance improvements compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines with a light-weight (7B) LLM backbone.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

This criterion assigns a distinct weight to each excursion set point based on the associated field. We apply the cmd-$n$ on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to identify the cosmic string networks (CSs) through their unique Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins effect on the temperature anisotropies. We also formulate the perturbative expansion of cmd-$n$ for the weak non-Gaussian regime up to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma_0^3)$. We propose a comprehensive pipeline designed to analyze the morphological properties of string-induced CMB maps within the flat sky approximation. To evaluate the robustness of our proposed criteria, we employ string-induced high-resolution flat-sky CMB simulated patches of $7.2$ deg$^2$ size with a resolution of $0.42$ arc-minutes. Our results demonstrate that the minimum detectable value of cosmic string tension is $G\mu\gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-7}$ when a noise-free map is analyzed with normalized cmd-$n$. Whereas for the ACT, CMB-S4, and Planck-like experiments at 95.45\% confidence level, the normalized cmd-$n$ can distinguish the CSs network for $G\mu\gtrsim2.9 \times 10^{-7}$, $G\mu\gtrsim 2.4\times 10^{-7}$ and $G\mu\gtrsim 5.8\times 10^{-7}$, respectively. The normalized cmd-$n$ exhibits a significantly enhanced capability in detecting CSs relative to the Minkowski Functionals.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures and 3 tables, comments are welcome, V2: added some references, V3: matched to the published version</p></details> |

However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model, without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization.

| **[Transferable Model-agnostic Vision-Language Model Adaptation for Efficient Weak-to-Strong Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08604v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance 'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained, this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain, often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual recognition tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, there remains a fundamental disconnect between the probabilistic 5G delay characteristics and the often idealistic delay models used to synthesize 5G-TSN network configurations. For time-driven schedules in particular, any delay outlier unforeseen during schedule synthesis can jeopardize the robustness of their real-time guarantees. To address this challenge, we present the (m,k)-firm Elevation Policy to uphold a base level of weakly hard real-time guarantees during unstable network conditions that do not match the expected delay characteristics. It augments the primary time-driven schedule with a dynamic priority-driven scheme to elevate the priority of m out of k consecutive frames if they are delayed. Our evaluations demonstrate that weakly hard real-time guarantees are essential to uphold the quality of control within a networked control system. At the same time, only a small overhead is imposed when the primary schedule can provide stronger quality of service guarantees. Our (m,k)-firm Elevation Policy thereby yields a robust but light-weight fallback mechanism to serve applications with meaningful guarantees during unstable network conditions.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |

This requires the redevelopment of the model when applying it to a new BCI paradigm, resulting in repeated costs and effort. Moreover, less complex deep learning models are desired for practical usage, as well as for deployment on portable devices. In or-der to fill the above gaps, we, in this study, proposed a light-weight and unified decoding model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification. The proposed model starts with a tempo-spatial convolution. It is followed by a multi-scale local feature selec-tion module, aiming to extract local features shared across BCI paradigms and generate weighted features. Finally, a mul-ti-dimensional global feature extraction module is designed, in which multi-dimensional global features are extracted from the weighted features and fused with the weighted features to form high-level feature representations associated with BCI para-digms. The results, evaluated on a mixture of three classical BCI paradigms (i.e., MI, SSVEP, and P300), demon-strate that the proposed model achieves 88.39%, 82.36%, 80.01%, and 0.8092 for accuracy, macro-precision, mac-ro-recall, and macro-F1-score, respectively, significantly out-performing the compared models. This study pro-vides a feasible solution for cross-BCI-paradigm classifica-tion. It lays a technological foundation for de-veloping a new generation of unified decoding systems, paving the way for low-cost and universal practical applications.</p></details> |  |

This works presents the ReQAP system that supports users with answers for complex questions that involve filters, joins and aggregation over heterogeneous sources. The unique trait of ReQAP is that it recursively decomposes questions and incrementally builds an operator tree for execution. Both the question interpretation and the individual operators make smart use of light-weight language models, with judicious fine-tuning. The demo showcases the rich functionality for advanced user questions, and also offers detailed tracking of how the answers are computed by the operators in the execution tree. Being able to trace answers back to the underlying sources is vital for human comprehensibility and user trust in the system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CIKM 2025 (demonstration paper)</p></details> |
| **[Automated Privacy Information Annotation in Large Language Model Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20910v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Users interacting with large language models (LLMs) under their real identifiers often unknowingly risk disclosing private information. Automatically notifying users whether their queries leak privacy and which phrases leak what private information has therefore become a practical need. Existing privacy detection methods, however, were designed for different objectives and application domains, typically tagging personally identifiable information (PII) in anonymous content, which is insufficient in real-name interaction scenarios with LLMs. In this work, to support the development and evaluation of privacy detection models for LLM interactions that are deployable on local user devices, we construct a large-scale multilingual dataset with 249K user queries and 154K annotated privacy phrases. In particular, we build an automated privacy annotation pipeline with strong LLMs to automatically extract privacy phrases from dialogue datasets and annotate leaked information. We also design evaluation metrics at the levels of privacy leakage, extracted privacy phrase, and privacy information. We further establish baseline methods using light-weight LLMs with both tuning-free and tuning-based methods, and report a comprehensive evaluation of their performance. Evaluation results reveal a gap between current performance and the requirements of real-world LLM applications, motivating future research into more effective local privacy detection methods grounded in our dataset.</p></details> | 8 content pages |
| **[Differentially Private Federated Clustering with Random Rebalancing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06183v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated clustering aims to group similar clients into clusters and produce one model for each cluster. Such a personalization approach typically improves model performance compared with training a single model to serve all clients, but can be more vulnerable to privacy leakage. Directly applying client-level differentially private (DP) mechanisms to federated clustering could degrade the utilities significantly. We identify that such deficiencies are mainly due to the difficulties of averaging privacy noise within each cluster (following standard privacy mechanisms), as the number of clients assigned to the same clusters is uncontrolled. To this end, we propose a simple and effective technique, named RR-Cluster, that can be viewed as a light-weight add-on to many federated clustering algorithms. RR-Cluster achieves reduced privacy noise via randomly rebalancing cluster assignments, guaranteeing a minimum number of clients assigned to each cluster. We analyze the tradeoffs between decreased privacy noise variance and potentially increased bias from incorrect assignments and provide convergence bounds for RR-Clsuter. Empirically, we demonstrate the RR-Cluster plugged into strong federated clustering algorithms results in significantly improved privacy/utility tradeoffs across both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | 21 pages |

VISTAR introduces a two-tier hybrid paradigm: it employs deterministic, scriptable metrics for physically quantifiable attributes (e.g., text rendering, lighting) and a novel Hierarchical Weighted P/N Questioning (HWPQ) scheme that uses constrained vision-language models to assess abstract semantics (e.g., style fusion, cultural fidelity). Grounded in a Delphi study with 120 experts, we defined seven user roles and nine evaluation angles to construct the benchmark, which comprises 2,845 prompts validated by over 15,000 human pairwise comparisons. Our metrics achieve high human alignment (>75%), with the HWPQ scheme reaching 85.9% accuracy on abstract semantics, significantly outperforming VQA baselines. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals no universal champion, as role-weighted scores reorder rankings and provide actionable guidance for domain-specific deployment. All resources are publicly released to foster reproducible T2I assessment.</p></details> | 17 pages,8 figures |
| **[Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators (FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion) parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of tokens for both.

However, this paradigm faces fundamental challenges: subjective tasks often lack absolute ground truth, and sparse annotation coverage makes aggregation statistically unreliable. We introduce a paradigm shift from sample-wise aggregation to annotator-wise behavior modeling. By treating annotator disagreements as valuable information rather than noise, modeling annotator-specific behavior patterns can reconstruct unlabeled data to reduce annotation cost, enhance aggregation reliability, and explain annotator decision behavior. To this end, we propose QuMAB (Query-based Multi-Annotator Behavior Pattern Learning), which uses light-weight queries to model individual annotators while capturing inter-annotator correlations as implicit regularization, preventing overfitting to sparse individual data while maintaining individualization and improving generalization, with a visualization of annotator focus regions offering an explainable analysis of behavior understanding. We contribute two large-scale datasets with dense per-annotator labels: STREET (4,300 labels/annotator) and AMER (average 3,118 labels/annotator), the first multimodal multi-annotator dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our QuMAB in modeling individual annotators' behavior patterns, their utility for consensus prediction, and applicability under sparse annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.15237</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking the Potential of MLLMs in Referring Expression Segmentation via a Light-weight Mask Decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04107v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding, their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction. Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost.

However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise. To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed, and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community contributions and dataset evolution.</p></details> |  |

Prior work on risk estimation either outputs coarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes indicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses narrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk Index (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks based on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting control commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning within a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) principles, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation, and an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate CRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using a state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our collision-rate metrics show a 19\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions per failed route, a 20\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a 17\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically significant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6 ms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially improves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while maintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.</p></details> | ITSC 2025, 7 pages |

While recent advances in large language models have greatly improved performance, most existing approaches depend on models with tens of billions of parameters or costly APIs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments. For real world, especially on edge devices, it is crucial for Text-to-SQL to ensure cost-effectiveness. Therefore, enabling the light-weight models for Text-to-SQL is of great practical significance. However, smaller LLMs often struggle with complicated user instruction, redundant schema linking or syntax correctness. To address these challenges, we propose MCTS-SQL, a novel framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide SQL generation through multi-step refinement. Since the light-weight models' weak performance of single-shot prediction, we generate better results through several trials with feedback. However, directly applying MCTS-based methods inevitably leads to significant time and computational overhead. Driven by this issue, we propose a token-level prefix-cache mechanism that stores prior information during iterations, effectively improved the execution speed. Experiments results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using a small open-source Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B, our method outperforms ChatGPT-3.5. When leveraging a more powerful model Gemini 2.5 to explore the performance upper bound, we achieved results competitive with the SOTA. Our findings demonstrate that even small models can be effectively deployed in practical Text-to-SQL systems with the right strategy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

However, current learning-based methods often struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency: methods that achieve high accuracy typically demand substantial processing power, while faster approaches tend to sacrifice precision. These fast approaches specifically falter in their generalization capabilities and do not perform well across diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we revisit the limitations of the SOTA methods and present NeuFlow-V2, a novel method that offers both - high accuracy in real-world datasets coupled with low computational overhead. In particular, we introduce a novel light-weight backbone and a fast refinement module to keep computational demands tractable while delivering accurate optical flow. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NeuFlow-V2 provides similar accuracy to SOTA methods while achieving 10x-70x speedups. It is capable of running at over 20 FPS on 512x384 resolution images on a Jetson Orin Nano.

However, FNOs face significant scalability challenges due to overparameterization and offer no native uncertainty quantification -- a key requirement for reliable scientific and engineering applications. Instead, neural operators rely on post hoc UQ methods that ignore geometric inductive biases. In this work, we introduce DINOZAUR: a diffusion-based neural operator parametrization with uncertainty quantification. Inspired by the structure of the heat kernel, DINOZAUR replaces the dense tensor multiplier in FNOs with a dimensionality-independent diffusion multiplier that has a single learnable time parameter per channel, drastically reducing parameter count and memory footprint without compromising predictive performance. By defining priors over those time parameters, we cast DINOZAUR as a Bayesian neural operator to yield spatially correlated outputs and calibrated uncertainty estimates. Our method achieves competitive or superior performance across several PDE benchmarks while providing efficient uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |

It can develop generalized representations or more balanced decision boundaries, preventing the degradation of long-term knowledge over time and thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Some emerging incremental learning methods adopt an encoder-decoder architecture and have achieved promising results. In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the generalization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it helps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and robustness to new, diverse data inputs. However, many existing continual methods focus solely on enhancing one of the two components, which limits their effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. And these methods perform even worse in small-memory scenarios, where only a limited number of historical samples can be stored. To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a two-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on sequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially, SEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized representations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and balance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation (KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more generalized encoder. This involves using a balanced KD approach and feature KD for effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show SEDEG's superior performance, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of its components. The code is available at https://github.com/ShaolingPu/CIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICONIP2025</p></details> |

Exploring Joint Training in the Context of Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10003v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to adapt to continuously emerging new classes while preserving knowledge of previously learned ones. Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) presents a greater challenge that requires the model to learn new classes from only a limited number of samples per class. While incremental learning typically assumes restricted access to past data, it often remains available in many real-world scenarios. This raises a practical question: should one retrain the model on the full dataset (i.e., joint training), or continue updating it solely with new data? In CIL, joint training is considered an ideal benchmark that provides a reference for evaluating the trade-offs between performance and computational cost. However, in FSCIL, joint training becomes less reliable due to severe imbalance between base and incremental classes. This results in the absence of a practical baseline, making it unclear which strategy is preferable for practitioners. To this end, we revisit joint training in the context of FSCIL by incorporating imbalance mitigation techniques, and suggest a new imbalance-aware joint training benchmark for FSCIL. We then conduct extensive comparisons between this benchmark and FSCIL methods to analyze which approach is most suitable when prior data is accessible. Our analysis offers realistic insights and guidance for selecting training strategies in real-world FSCIL scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/shiwonkim/Joint_FSCIL</p></details> |  |

CIR assumes that we can easily access abundant unlabeled data from external sources, such as the Internet. Therefore, we propose two components that efficiently use the unlabeled data to ensure the high stability and the plasticity of models trained in CIR setup. First, we introduce multi-level knowledge distillation (MLKD) that distills knowledge from multiple previous models across multiple perspectives, including features and logits, so the model can maintain much various previous knowledge. Moreover, we implement dynamic self-supervised loss (SSL) to utilize the unlabeled data that accelerates the learning of new classes, while dynamic weighting of SSL keeps the focus of training to the primary task. Both of our proposed components significantly improve the performance in CIR setup, achieving 2nd place in the CVPR 5th CLVISION Challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[ESSENTIAL: Episodic and Semantic Memory Integration for Video Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10896v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning (VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 ICCV Highlight paper, 17 pages including supplementary material</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Incremental Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09974v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph incremental learning is a learning paradigm that aims to adapt trained models to continuously incremented graphs and data over time without the need for retraining on the full dataset. However, regular graph machine learning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental learning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new knowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the previously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to maintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however, do not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different timestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns can be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the new data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic mixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a DyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming data blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data sequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve old tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the number of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full mixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a sparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make predictions, significantly reducing the computation time. Our model achieved 4.92\% relative accuracy increase compared to the best baselines on class incremental learning, showing the model's exceptional power.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSS-Prompt: Dynamic-Static Synergistic Prompting for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09785v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization ability has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks recently, but it is still underexplored in the challenging few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) task. It aims to continually learn new concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely, we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic forgetting issue as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACMMM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Achieving More with Less: Additive Prompt Tuning for Rehearsal-Free Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07979v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes progressively while preserving knowledge of previously learned ones. Recent advances in this field have shifted towards parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, with many approaches building upon the framework that maintains a pool of learnable prompts. Although effective, these methods introduce substantial computational overhead, primarily due to prompt pool querying and increased input sequence lengths from prompt concatenation. In this work, we present a novel prompt-based approach that addresses this limitation. Our method trains a single set of shared prompts across all tasks and, rather than concatenating prompts to the input, directly modifies the CLS token's attention computation by adding the prompts to it. This simple and lightweight design not only significantly reduces computational complexity-both in terms of inference costs and the number of trainable parameters-but also eliminates the need to optimize prompt lengths for different downstream tasks, offering a more efficient yet powerful solution for rehearsal-free class-incremental learning. Extensive experiments across a diverse range of CIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to establish a new prompt-based CIL paradigm. Furthermore, experiments on general recognition benchmarks beyond the CIL setting also show strong performance, positioning our method as a promising candidate for a general parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach.</p></details> |  |

However, the vulnerability of the models against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation. Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks.

| **[Multi-level Collaborative Distillation Meets Global Workspace Model: A Unified Framework for OCIL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08677v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective. While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared, implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch, capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models across various memory budgets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters for Pre-Trained Model-based Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08165v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a learning system to continually learn new classes without forgetting. Existing pre-trained model-based CIL methods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks using additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect module selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules often overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing between similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this paper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most crucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter. Furthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal adapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks.

| **[Dynamic Robot-Assisted Surgery with Hierarchical Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01713v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work, we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than 144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at http://topics.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at MICCAI AMAI 2025 workshop</p></details> |
| **[OpenHAIV: A Framework Towards Practical Open-World Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07270v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Substantial progress has been made in various techniques for open-world recognition. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods can effectively distinguish between known and unknown classes in the data, while incremental learning enables continuous model knowledge updates. However, in open-world scenarios, these approaches still face limitations. Relying solely on OOD detection does not facilitate knowledge updates in the model, and incremental fine-tuning typically requires supervised conditions, which significantly deviate from open-world settings. To address these challenges, this paper proposes OpenHAIV, a novel framework that integrates OOD detection, new class discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning into a unified pipeline. This framework allows models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in open-world environments. The proposed framework is available at https://haiv-lab.github.io/openhaiv .</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes, results, and OpenHAIV documentation available at https://haiv-lab.github.io/openhaiv</p></details> |
| **[Continual Multiple Instance Learning for Hematologic Disease Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04368v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection). Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MICCAI 2025 workshop on Efficient Medical AI</p></details> |
| **[Sculpting Margin Penalty: Intra-Task Adapter Merging and Classifier Calibration for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05094v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL). However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200 demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning New Concepts, Remembering the Old: Continual Learning for Multimodal Concept Bottleneck Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17471v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance the interpretability of AI systems, particularly by bridging visual input with human-understandable concepts, effectively acting as a form of multimodal interpretability model. However, existing CBMs typically assume static datasets, which fundamentally limits their adaptability to real-world, continuously evolving multimodal data streams. To address this, we define a novel continual learning task for CBMs: simultaneously handling concept-incremental and class-incremental learning. This task requires models to continuously acquire new concepts (often representing cross-modal attributes) and classes while robustly preserving previously learned knowledge. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose CONceptual Continual Incremental Learning (CONCIL), a novel framework that fundamentally re-imagines concept and decision layer updates as linear regression problems. This reformulation eliminates the need for gradient-based optimization, thereby effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, CONCIL relies solely on recursive matrix operations, rendering it highly computationally efficient and well-suited for real-time and large-scale multimodal data applications. Experimental results compellingly demonstrate that CONCIL achieves "absolute knowledge memory" and significantly surpasses the performance of traditional CBM methods in both concept- and class-incremental settings, thus establishing a new paradigm for continual learning in CBMs, particularly valuable for dynamic multimodal understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Welcome New Doctor: Continual Learning with Expert Consultation and Autoregressive Inference for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02220v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study, we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lifelong Person Re-identification via Privacy-Preserving Data Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01587v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently, replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this, exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other replay-based methods, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[DuET: Dual Incremental Object Detection via Exemplar-Free Task Arithmetic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21260v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Ambiguity-Guided Learnable Distribution Calibration for Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23237v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes. Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However, these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Prompt-Based Exemplar Super-Compression and Regeneration for Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18266v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Replay-based methods in class-incremental learning (CIL) have attained remarkable success. Despite their effectiveness, the inherent memory restriction results in saving a limited number of exemplars with poor diversity. In this paper, we introduce PESCR, a novel approach that substantially increases the quantity and enhances the diversity of exemplars based on a pre-trained general-purpose diffusion model, without fine-tuning it on target datasets or storing it in the memory buffer. Images are compressed into visual and textual prompts, which are saved instead of the original images, decreasing memory consumption by a factor of 24. In subsequent phases, diverse exemplars are regenerated by the diffusion model. We further propose partial compression and diffusion-based data augmentation to minimize the domain gap between generated exemplars and real images. PESCR significantly improves CIL performance across multiple benchmarks, e.g., 3.2% above the previous state-of-the-art on ImageNet-100.</p></details> | <details><summary>BMVC ...</summary><p>BMVC 2025.
