While structured weight pruning and token compression have emerged as promising solutions, they suffer from prolonged retraining times and global propagation that creates optimization challenges, respectively. We propose ToaSt, a decoupled framework applying specialized strategies to distinct ViT components. We apply coupled head-wise structured pruning to Multi-Head Self-Attention modules, leveraging attention operation characteristics to enhance robustness. For Feed-Forward Networks (over 60\% of FLOPs), we introduce Token Channel Selection (TCS) that enhances compression ratios while avoiding global propagation issues. Our analysis reveals TCS effectively filters redundant noise during selection. Extensive evaluations across nine diverse models, including DeiT, ViT-MAE, and Swin Transformer, demonstrate that ToaSt achieves superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, consistently outperforming existing baselines. On ViT-MAE-Huge, ToaSt achieves 88.52\% accuracy (+1.64 \%) with 39.4\% FLOPs reduction. ToaSt transfers effectively to downstream tasks, cccccachieving 52.2 versus 51.9 mAP on COCO object detection.

Can policies using a fixed amount of parameters, still benefit from additional compute? The standard RL framework does not provide a language to answer these questions formally. Empirically, deep RL policies are often parameterized as neural networks with static architectures, conflating the amount of compute and the number of parameters. In this paper, we formalize compute bounded policies and prove that policies which use more compute can solve problems and generalize to longer-horizon tasks that are outside the scope of policies with less compute. Building on prior work in algorithmic learning and model-free planning, we propose a minimal architecture that can use a variable amount of compute. Our experiments complement our theory. On a set 31 different tasks spanning online and offline RL, we show that $(1)$ this architecture achieves stronger performance simply by using more compute, and $(2)$ stronger generalization on longer-horizon test tasks compared to standard feedforward networks or deep residual network using up to 5 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches address these issues in isolation and lack a unified, regulation-compliant solution under realistic adversarial conditions. In this work, we present a unified security framework for DB-CRNs that simultaneously provides location privacy, user anonymity, verifiable location, and DoS resilience. Our framework, denoted as SLAPX, enables privacy-preserving spectrum queries using delegatable anonymous credentials, supports adaptive location verification without revealing precise user location, and mitigates DoS attacks through verifiable delay functions (VDFs) combined with RLRS-based rate limiting. Extensive cryptographic benchmarking and network simulations demonstrate that SLAPX achieves significantly lower latency and communication overhead than existing solutions while effectively resisting location spoofing and DoS attacks. These results show that SLAPX is practical and well-suited for secure next-generation DB-CRN deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in flexible information extraction, their ability to produce precisely structured tables remains insufficiently understood, particularly for indirect extraction that requires complex capabilities such as reasoning and conflict resolution. Existing benchmarks neither explicitly distinguish nor comprehensively cover the diverse capabilities required in Doc2Table extraction. We argue that a capability-aware benchmark is essential for systematic evaluation. However, constructing such benchmarks using human-annotated document-table pairs is costly, difficult to scale, and limited in capability coverage. To address this, we adopt a reverse Table2Doc paradigm and design a multi-agent synthesis workflow to generate documents from ground-truth tables. Based on this approach, we present DTBench, a synthetic benchmark that adopts a proposed two-level taxonomy of Doc2Table capabilities, covering 5 major categories and 13 subcategories. We evaluate several mainstream LLMs on DTBench, and demonstrate substantial performance gaps across models, as well as persistent challenges in reasoning, faithfulness, and conflict resolution. DTBench provides a comprehensive testbed for data generation and evaluation, facilitating future research on Doc2Table extraction. The benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/ZJU-DAILY/DTBench.</p></details> |  |

This gap limits research and policy analysis on the community impacts of truck traffic, especially concerning air quality and public health. To address this, we use random forest regression to estimate medium- and heavy-duty vehicle traffic volumes on network links where these data are missing. The result is a comprehensive vehicle traffic dataset that covers 85.2% of public roadways in the United States. From these data, we also calculate traffic density values for each census block and vehicle class that can serve as a high-resolution surrogate for traffic-related air pollution exposure in public health studies and policy analysis. Our high-resolution spatial data products are rigorously validated and provide a more complete representation of truck traffic than any existing publicly available dataset. These datasets are valuable for transportation planning, public health research, and policy decisions aimed at understanding and mitigating the effects of truck traffic on communities that are disproportionately exposed to air pollution from vehicle traffic.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages including references, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Stable-MoE: Lyapunov-based Token Routing for Distributed Mixture-of-Experts Training over Edge Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06784v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sparse activation mechanism of mixture of experts (MoE) model empowers edge intelligence with enhanced training efficiency and reduced computational resource consumption. However, traditional token routing in distributed MoE training faces significant challenges in resource-constrained edge networks characterized by heterogeneous computing capabilities and stochastic token arrivals, which inevitably suffer from workload backlog, resource inefficiency, and performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Lyapunov-based token routing framework for distributed MoE training over resource-heterogeneous edge networks, termed Stable-MoE. Specifically, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem to maximize both system throughput and gating consistency via optimizing the token routing strategy and computational resource allocation, while ensuring long-term stability of both token and energy queues at the edge devices. Using the Lyapunov optimization, we transform the intractable long-term optimization problem into tractable per-slot subproblems by enabling online decision-making of token routing and computation frequency utilization without the knowledge of future system states. Experimental results on the SVHN and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that Stable-MoE outperforms the baselines with at least 40% and 5% gains in system throughput and test accuracy, respectively.</p></details> |  |

| **[GenDA: Generative Data Assimilation on Complex Urban Areas via Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11440v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.</p></details> |  |

However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Token-Based Audio Inpainting via Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08333v4)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio inpainting seeks to restore missing segments in degraded recordings. Previous diffusion-based methods exhibit impaired performance when the missing region is large. We introduce the first approach that applies discrete diffusion over tokenized music representations from a pre-trained audio tokenizer, enabling stable and semantically coherent restoration of long gaps. Our method further incorporates two training approaches: a derivative-based regularization loss that enforces smooth temporal dynamics, and a span-based absorbing transition that provides structured corruption during diffusion. Experiments on the MusicNet and MAESTRO datasets with gaps up to 750 ms show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines across range of gap lengths, for gaps of 150 ms and above. This work advances musical audio restoration and introduces new directions for discrete diffusion model training. Visit our project page for examples and code.</p></details> |  |

Current methods either require heavyweight models at inference or rely on highly sequential imagination, both of which impose prohibitive computational costs. We propose Horizon Imagination (HI), an on-policy imagination process for discrete stochastic policies that denoises multiple future observations in parallel. HI incorporates a stabilization mechanism and a novel sampling schedule that decouples the denoising budget from the effective horizon over which denoising is applied while also supporting sub-frame budgets. Experiments on Atari 100K and Craftium show that our approach maintains control performance with a sub-frame budget of half the denoising steps and achieves superior generation quality under varied schedules.

| **[GlobeDiff: State Diffusion Process for Partial Observability in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15776v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of multi-agent systems, the challenge of \emph{partial observability} is a critical barrier to effective coordination and decision-making. Existing approaches, such as belief state estimation and inter-agent communication, often fall short. Belief-based methods are limited by their focus on past experiences without fully leveraging global information, while communication methods often lack a robust model to effectively utilize the auxiliary information they provide. To solve this issue, we propose Global State Diffusion Algorithm~(GlobeDiff) to infer the global state based on the local observations. By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GlobeDiff achieves superior performance and is capable of accurately inferring the global state.</p></details> |  |

This approach is a significant departure from traditional floating point discretisations and offers several advantages; including compatibility with stochastic computing architectures that avoid floating-point arithmetic in place of directly manipulating the underlying probability distribution of a bitstream, elimination of Gaussian sampling requirements, robustness to quantisation errors, and handling of non-Lipschitz drifts. We prove weak convergence and demonstrate the advantages through experiments on various SDEs, including state-of-the-art diffusion models.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |

| **[UrbanVerse: Learning Urban Region Representation Across Cities and Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15750v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in urban region representation learning have enabled a wide range of applications in urban analytics, yet existing methods remain limited in their capabilities to generalize across cities and analytic tasks. We aim to generalize urban representation learning beyond city- and task-specific settings, towards a foundation-style model for urban analytics. To this end, we propose UrbanVerse, a model for cross-city urban representation learning and cross-task urban analytics. For cross-city generalization, UrbanVerse focuses on features local to the target regions and structural features of the nearby regions rather than the entire city. We model regions as nodes on a graph, which enables a random walk-based procedure to form "sequences of regions" that reflect both local and neighborhood structural features for urban region representation learning. For cross-task generalization, we propose a cross-task learning module named HCondDiffCT. This module integrates region-conditioned prior knowledge and task-conditioned semantics into the diffusion process to jointly model multiple downstream urban prediction tasks. HCondDiffCT is generic. It can also be integrated with existing urban representation learning models to enhance their downstream task effectiveness. Experiments on real-world datasets show that UrbanVerse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six tasks under cross-city settings, achieving up to 35.89% improvements in prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Building upon the agentic, reasoning, and coding (ARC) capabilities of its predecessor, GLM-5 adopts DSA to significantly reduce training and inference costs while maintaining long-context fidelity. To advance model alignment and autonomy, we implement a new asynchronous reinforcement learning infrastructure that drastically improves post-training efficiency by decoupling generation from training. Furthermore, we propose novel asynchronous agent RL algorithms that further improve RL quality, enabling the model to learn from complex, long-horizon interactions more effectively. Through these innovations, GLM-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on major open benchmarks.

While structured weight pruning and token compression have emerged as promising solutions, they suffer from prolonged retraining times and global propagation that creates optimization challenges, respectively. We propose ToaSt, a decoupled framework applying specialized strategies to distinct ViT components. We apply coupled head-wise structured pruning to Multi-Head Self-Attention modules, leveraging attention operation characteristics to enhance robustness. For Feed-Forward Networks (over 60\% of FLOPs), we introduce Token Channel Selection (TCS) that enhances compression ratios while avoiding global propagation issues. Our analysis reveals TCS effectively filters redundant noise during selection. Extensive evaluations across nine diverse models, including DeiT, ViT-MAE, and Swin Transformer, demonstrate that ToaSt achieves superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, consistently outperforming existing baselines. On ViT-MAE-Huge, ToaSt achieves 88.52\% accuracy (+1.64 \%) with 39.4\% FLOPs reduction. ToaSt transfers effectively to downstream tasks, cccccachieving 52.2 versus 51.9 mAP on COCO object detection.

Empirically, deep RL policies are often parameterized as neural networks with static architectures, conflating the amount of compute and the number of parameters. In this paper, we formalize compute bounded policies and prove that policies which use more compute can solve problems and generalize to longer-horizon tasks that are outside the scope of policies with less compute. Building on prior work in algorithmic learning and model-free planning, we propose a minimal architecture that can use a variable amount of compute. Our experiments complement our theory.

Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in flexible information extraction, their ability to produce precisely structured tables remains insufficiently understood, particularly for indirect extraction that requires complex capabilities such as reasoning and conflict resolution. Existing benchmarks neither explicitly distinguish nor comprehensively cover the diverse capabilities required in Doc2Table extraction. We argue that a capability-aware benchmark is essential for systematic evaluation. However, constructing such benchmarks using human-annotated document-table pairs is costly, difficult to scale, and limited in capability coverage. To address this, we adopt a reverse Table2Doc paradigm and design a multi-agent synthesis workflow to generate documents from ground-truth tables. Based on this approach, we present DTBench, a synthetic benchmark that adopts a proposed two-level taxonomy of Doc2Table capabilities, covering 5 major categories and 13 subcategories. We evaluate several mainstream LLMs on DTBench, and demonstrate substantial performance gaps across models, as well as persistent challenges in reasoning, faithfulness, and conflict resolution.

However, traditional token routing in distributed MoE training faces significant challenges in resource-constrained edge networks characterized by heterogeneous computing capabilities and stochastic token arrivals, which inevitably suffer from workload backlog, resource inefficiency, and performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Lyapunov-based token routing framework for distributed MoE training over resource-heterogeneous edge networks, termed Stable-MoE. Specifically, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem to maximize both system throughput and gating consistency via optimizing the token routing strategy and computational resource allocation, while ensuring long-term stability of both token and energy queues at the edge devices. Using the Lyapunov optimization, we transform the intractable long-term optimization problem into tractable per-slot subproblems by enabling online decision-making of token routing and computation frequency utilization without the knowledge of future system states. Experimental results on the SVHN and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that Stable-MoE outperforms the baselines with at least 40% and 5% gains in system throughput and test accuracy, respectively.</p></details> |  |

We develop a finite-sample, design-based formulation of random forests in which each tree is an explicit randomized conditional regression function. This perspective yields an exact variance identity for the forest predictor that separates finite-aggregation variability from a structural dependence term that persists even under infinite aggregation. We further decompose both single-tree dispersion and inter-tree covariance using the laws of total variance and covariance, isolating two fundamental design mechanisms-reuse of training observations and alignment of data-adaptive partitions. These mechanisms induce a strict covariance floor, demonstrating that predictive variability cannot be eliminated by increasing the number of trees alone. The resulting framework clarifies how resampling, feature-level randomization, and split selection govern resolution, tree variability, and dependence, and establishes random forests as explicit finite-sample statistical designs whose behavior is determined by their underlying randomized construction.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 2 figures.

Using the Lyapunov optimization, we transform the intractable long-term optimization problem into tractable per-slot subproblems by enabling online decision-making of token routing and computation frequency utilization without the knowledge of future system states. Experimental results on the SVHN and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that Stable-MoE outperforms the baselines with at least 40% and 5% gains in system throughput and test accuracy, respectively.</p></details> |  |

| **[GLM-5: from Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15763v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GLM-5, a next-generation foundation model designed to transition the paradigm of vibe coding to agentic engineering. Building upon the agentic, reasoning, and coding (ARC) capabilities of its predecessor, GLM-5 adopts DSA to significantly reduce training and inference costs while maintaining long-context fidelity. To advance model alignment and autonomy, we implement a new asynchronous reinforcement learning infrastructure that drastically improves post-training efficiency by decoupling generation from training. Furthermore, we propose novel asynchronous agent RL algorithms that further improve RL quality, enabling the model to learn from complex, long-horizon interactions more effectively. Through these innovations, GLM-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on major open benchmarks. Most critically, GLM-5 demonstrates unprecedented capability in real-world coding tasks, surpassing previous baselines in handling end-to-end software engineering challenges. Code, models, and more information are available at https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-5.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToaSt: Token Channel Selection and Structured Pruning for Efficient ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15720v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success across various vision tasks, yet their deployment is often hindered by prohibitive computational costs. While structured weight pruning and token compression have emerged as promising solutions, they suffer from prolonged retraining times and global propagation that creates optimization challenges, respectively. We propose ToaSt, a decoupled framework applying specialized strategies to distinct ViT components. We apply coupled head-wise structured pruning to Multi-Head Self-Attention modules, leveraging attention operation characteristics to enhance robustness. For Feed-Forward Networks (over 60\% of FLOPs), we introduce Token Channel Selection (TCS) that enhances compression ratios while avoiding global propagation issues. Our analysis reveals TCS effectively filters redundant noise during selection. Extensive evaluations across nine diverse models, including DeiT, ViT-MAE, and Swin Transformer, demonstrate that ToaSt achieves superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, consistently outperforming existing baselines. On ViT-MAE-Huge, ToaSt achieves 88.52\% accuracy (+1.64 \%) with 39.4\% FLOPs reduction. ToaSt transfers effectively to downstream tasks, cccccachieving 52.2 versus 51.9 mAP on COCO object detection. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[On the Role of Iterative Computation in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05999v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How does the amount of compute available to a reinforcement learning (RL) policy affect its learning? Can policies using a fixed amount of parameters, still benefit from additional compute? The standard RL framework does not provide a language to answer these questions formally. Empirically, deep RL policies are often parameterized as neural networks with static architectures, conflating the amount of compute and the number of parameters. In this paper, we formalize compute bounded policies and prove that policies which use more compute can solve problems and generalize to longer-horizon tasks that are outside the scope of policies with less compute. Building on prior work in algorithmic learning and model-free planning, we propose a minimal architecture that can use a variable amount of compute. Our experiments complement our theory. On a set 31 different tasks spanning online and offline RL, we show that $(1)$ this architecture achieves stronger performance simply by using more compute, and $(2)$ stronger generalization on longer-horizon test tasks compared to standard feedforward networks or deep residual network using up to 5 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving and Secure Spectrum Sharing for Database-Driven Cognitive Radio Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15705v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database-driven cognitive radio networks (DB-CRNs) enable dynamic spectrum sharing through geolocation databases but introduce critical security and privacy challenges, including mandatory location disclosure, susceptibility to location spoofing, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on centralized services. Existing approaches address these issues in isolation and lack a unified, regulation-compliant solution under realistic adversarial conditions. In this work, we present a unified security framework for DB-CRNs that simultaneously provides location privacy, user anonymity, verifiable location, and DoS resilience. Our framework, denoted as SLAPX, enables privacy-preserving spectrum queries using delegatable anonymous credentials, supports adaptive location verification without revealing precise user location, and mitigates DoS attacks through verifiable delay functions (VDFs) combined with RLRS-based rate limiting. Extensive cryptographic benchmarking and network simulations demonstrate that SLAPX achieves significantly lower latency and communication overhead than existing solutions while effectively resisting location spoofing and DoS attacks. These results show that SLAPX is practical and well-suited for secure next-generation DB-CRN deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[DTBench: A Synthetic Benchmark for Document-to-Table Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13812v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document-to-table (Doc2Table) extraction derives structured tables from unstructured documents under a target schema, enabling reliable and verifiable SQL-based data analytics. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in flexible information extraction, their ability to produce precisely structured tables remains insufficiently understood, particularly for indirect extraction that requires complex capabilities such as reasoning and conflict resolution. Existing benchmarks neither explicitly distinguish nor comprehensively cover the diverse capabilities required in Doc2Table extraction. We argue that a capability-aware benchmark is essential for systematic evaluation. However, constructing such benchmarks using human-annotated document-table pairs is costly, difficult to scale, and limited in capability coverage. To address this, we adopt a reverse Table2Doc paradigm and design a multi-agent synthesis workflow to generate documents from ground-truth tables. Based on this approach, we present DTBench, a synthetic benchmark that adopts a proposed two-level taxonomy of Doc2Table capabilities, covering 5 major categories and 13 subcategories. We evaluate several mainstream LLMs on DTBench, and demonstrate substantial performance gaps across models, as well as persistent challenges in reasoning, faithfulness, and conflict resolution. DTBench provides a comprehensive testbed for data generation and evaluation, facilitating future research on Doc2Table extraction. The benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/ZJU-DAILY/DTBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comprehensive and Spatially Detailed Passenger Vehicle and Truck Traffic Volume Data for the United States Estimated by Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05161v4)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Highway Performance Monitoring System, managed by the Federal Highway Administration, provides data on average annual daily traffic volume across roadways in the United States, but it has limited representation of medium- and heavy-duty vehicle traffic on lower-volume roadways that are not part of the national highway system. This gap limits research and policy analysis on the community impacts of truck traffic, especially concerning air quality and public health. To address this, we use random forest regression to estimate medium- and heavy-duty vehicle traffic volumes on network links where these data are missing. The result is a comprehensive vehicle traffic dataset that covers 85.2% of public roadways in the United States. From these data, we also calculate traffic density values for each census block and vehicle class that can serve as a high-resolution surrogate for traffic-related air pollution exposure in public health studies and policy analysis. Our high-resolution spatial data products are rigorously validated and provide a more complete representation of truck traffic than any existing publicly available dataset. These datasets are valuable for transportation planning, public health research, and policy decisions aimed at understanding and mitigating the effects of truck traffic on communities that are disproportionately exposed to air pollution from vehicle traffic.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages including references, 5 figures</p></details> |

However, traditional token routing in distributed MoE training faces significant challenges in resource-constrained edge networks characterized by heterogeneous computing capabilities and stochastic token arrivals, which inevitably suffer from workload backlog, resource inefficiency, and performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Lyapunov-based token routing framework for distributed MoE training over resource-heterogeneous edge networks, termed Stable-MoE. Specifically, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem to maximize both system throughput and gating consistency via optimizing the token routing strategy and computational resource allocation, while ensuring long-term stability of both token and energy queues at the edge devices.
