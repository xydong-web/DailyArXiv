| **[Can AI Agents Design and Implement Drug Discovery Pipelines?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19912v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly autonomous agentic systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs), presents new opportunities to accelerate drug discovery by improving in-silico modeling and reducing dependence on costly experimental trials. Current AI agent-based systems demonstrate proficiency in solving programming challenges and conducting research, indicating an emerging potential to develop software capable of addressing complex problems such as pharmaceutical design and drug discovery. This paper introduces DO Challenge, a benchmark designed to evaluate the decision-making abilities of AI agents in a single, complex problem resembling virtual screening scenarios. The benchmark challenges systems to independently develop, implement, and execute efficient strategies for identifying promising molecular structures from extensive datasets, while navigating chemical space, selecting models, and managing limited resources in a multi-objective context. We also discuss insights from the DO Challenge 2025, a competition based on the proposed benchmark, which showcased diverse strategies explored by human participants. Furthermore, we present the Deep Thought multi-agent system, which demonstrated strong performance on the benchmark, outperforming most human teams. Among the language models tested, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro and o3 performed best in primary agent roles, and GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash were effective in auxiliary roles. While promising, the system's performance still fell short of expert-designed solutions and showed high instability, highlighting both the potential and current limitations of AI-driven methodologies in transforming drug discovery and broader scientific research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Distributed Algorithms for Shape Reduction via Reconfigurable Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18663v3)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous reconfiguration of agent-based systems is a key challenge in the study of programmable matter, distributed robotics, and molecular self-assembly. While substantial prior work has focused on size-preserving transformations, much less is known about size-changing transformations. Such transformations find application in natural processes, active self-assembly, and dynamical systems, where structures may evolve through the addition or removal of components controlled by local rules. In this paper, we study efficient distributed algorithms for transforming 2D geometric configurations of simple agents, called shapes, using only local size-changing operations. A novelty of our approach is the use of reconfigurable circuits as the underlying communication model, a recently proposed model enabling instant node-to-node communication via primitive signals. Unlike previous work, we integrate collision avoidance as a core responsibility of the distributed algorithm. We consider two graph update models: connectivity and adjacency. Let $n$ denote the number of agents and $k$ the number of turning points in the initial shape. In the connectivity model, we show that any tree-shaped configuration can be reduced to a single agent using only shrinking operations in $O(k \log n)$ rounds w.h.p., and to its incompressible form in $O(\log n)$ rounds w.h.p. given prior knowledge of the incompressible nodes, or in $O(k \log n)$ rounds otherwise. When both shrinking and growth operations are available, we give an algorithm that transforms any tree to a topologically equivalent one in $O(k \log n + \log^2 n)$ rounds w.h.p. On the negative side, we show that one cannot hope for $o(\log^2 n)$-round transformations for all shapes of $\Theta(\log n)$ turning points. In the adjacency model, we show that any connected shape can reduce itself to a single node using only shrinking in $O(\log n)$ rounds w.h.p.</p></details> |  |
| **[Practical Transmitters for Molecular Communication: Functionalized Nanodevices Employing Cooperative Transmembrane Transport Proteins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06147v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel optically controllable molecular communication (MC) transmitter (TX) design based on vesicular nanodevices (NDs). The NDs are functionalized for the controlled release of signaling molecules (SMs) via transmembrane proteins. The proposed design contributes to overcoming the current barrier between MC theory and practical implementation, as all components of the system are chemically realizable. The NDs possess an optical-to-chemical conversion capability, therefore, the proposed NDs can be employed as externally controllable TXs in various MC systems. The proposed ND design comprises two cooperating modules, namely an energizing module and a release module, and, depending on the specific choices for the modules, allows for the release of different types of SMs. After introducing the general system model for the proposed realistic TX design, we provide a detailed mathematical analysis of a specific TX realization. In particular, we derive both an exact and a closed-form approximate analytical solution for the concentration of the released SMs and validate our results by comparison with a numerical solution. Moreover, we model the impact of a buffering medium, which is typically present in liquid environments, e.g., in experimental settings or in in-body applications. This allows the evaluation of the feasibility of our proposed TX design in practical chemical implementations. We consider various forms of parameter randomness occurring during vesicle synthesis, i.e., deviations which are unavoidable during experiments. We show that considering random distributions of the parameter values, such as the ND size, the number of incorporated proteins on the vesicle surface, and the vesicle membrane permeability, is crucial for an adequate kinetic analysis of the system.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages single column, 13 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Heterophily-informed Message Passing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19785v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to be vulnerable to oversmoothing due to their implicit homophily assumption. We mitigate this problem with a novel scheme that regulates the aggregation of messages, modulating the type and extent of message passing locally thereby preserving both the low and high-frequency components of information. Our approach relies solely on learnt embeddings, obviating the need for auxiliary labels, thus extending the benefits of heterophily-aware embeddings to broader applications, e.g., generative modelling. Our experiments, conducted across various data sets and GNN architectures, demonstrate performance enhancements and reveal heterophily patterns across standard classification benchmarks. Furthermore, application to molecular generation showcases notable performance improvements on chemoinformatics benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appearing in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path Discovery in Molecular Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16381v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update 28.04.2025: Added citation and reference to "Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional" by Sanjeev Raja et al. and added an appendix section clarifying some loss derivation steps</p></details> |
| **[SubGrapher: Visual Fingerprinting of Chemical Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19695v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic extraction of chemical structures from scientific literature plays a crucial role in accelerating research across fields ranging from drug discovery to materials science. Patent documents, in particular, contain molecular information in visual form, which is often inaccessible through traditional text-based searches. In this work, we introduce SubGrapher, a method for the visual fingerprinting of chemical structure images. Unlike conventional Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) models that attempt to reconstruct full molecular graphs, SubGrapher focuses on extracting molecular fingerprints directly from chemical structure images. Using learning-based instance segmentation, SubGrapher identifies functional groups and carbon backbones, constructing a substructure-based fingerprint that enables chemical structure retrieval. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art OCSR and fingerprinting methods, demonstrating superior retrieval performance and robustness across diverse molecular depictions. The dataset, models, and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Faster and More Compact Foundation Models for Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19538v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in machine learning for molecular property prediction have improved accuracy but at the expense of higher computational cost and longer training times. Recently, the Joint Multi-domain Pre-training (JMP) foundation model has demonstrated strong performance across various downstream tasks with reduced training time over previous models. Despite JMP's advantages, fine-tuning it on molecular datasets ranging from small-scale to large-scale requires considerable time and computational resources. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance efficiency by reducing model size while preserving performance. To better understand the model's efficiency, we analyze the layer contributions of JMP and find that later interaction blocks provide diminishing returns, suggesting an opportunity for model compression. We explore block reduction strategies by pruning the pre-trained model and evaluating its impact on efficiency and accuracy during fine-tuning. Our analysis reveals that removing two interaction blocks results in a minimal performance drop, reducing the model size by 32% while increasing inference throughput by 1.3x. These results suggest that JMP-L is over-parameterized and that a smaller, more efficient variant can achieve comparable performance with lower computational cost. Our study provides insights for developing lighter, faster, and more scalable foundation models for molecular and materials discovery.

| **[Improved Molecular Generation through Attribute-Driven Integrative Embeddings and GAN Selectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19040v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for molecules with tailored properties in fields such as drug discovery and chemical engineering has driven advancements in computational methods for molecular design. Machine learning-based approaches for de-novo molecular generation have recently garnered significant attention. This paper introduces a transformer-based vector embedding generator combined with a modified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate molecules with desired properties. The embedding generator utilizes a novel molecular descriptor, integrating Morgan fingerprints with global molecular attributes, enabling the transformer to capture local functional groups and broader molecular characteristics. Modifying the GAN generator loss function ensures the generation of molecules with specific desired properties. The transformer achieves a reconversion accuracy of 94% while translating molecular descriptors back to SMILES strings, validating the utility of the proposed embeddings for generative tasks. The approach is validated by generating novel odorant molecules using a labeled dataset of odorant and non-odorant compounds. With the modified range-loss function, the GAN exclusively generates odorant molecules. This work underscores the potential of combining novel vector embeddings with transformers and modified GAN architectures to accelerate the discovery of tailored molecules, offering a robust tool for diverse molecular design applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining GCN Structural Learning with LLM Chemical Knowledge for Enhanced Virtual Screening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17497v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual screening plays a critical role in modern drug discovery by enabling the identification of promising candidate molecules for experimental validation. Traditional machine learning methods such, as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost, rely on predefined molecular representations, often leading to information loss and potential bias. In contrast, deep learning approaches-particularly Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)-offer a more expressive and unbiased alternative by operating directly on molecular graphs. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in drug design, thanks to their capacity to capture complex chemical patterns from large-scale data via attention mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates GCNs with LLM-derived embeddings to combine localized structural learning with global chemical knowledge. The LLM embeddings can be precomputed and stored in a molecular feature library, removing the need to rerun the LLM during training or inference and thus maintaining computational efficiency. We found that concatenating the LLM embeddings after each GCN layer-rather than only at the final layer-significantly improves performance, enabling deeper integration of global context throughout the network. The resulting model achieves superior results, with an F1-score of (88.8\%), outperforming standalone GCN (87.9%), XGBoost (85.5%), and SVM (85.4%) baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18506v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Sampling, Public Dataset and Generative Model for Drug-Protein Dissociation Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18367v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug-protein binding and dissociation dynamics are fundamental to understanding molecular interactions in biological systems. While many tools for drug-protein interaction studies have emerged, especially artificial intelligence (AI)-based generative models, predictive tools on binding/dissociation kinetics and dynamics are still limited. We propose a novel research paradigm that combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, enhanced sampling, and AI generative models to address this issue. We propose an enhanced sampling strategy to efficiently implement the drug-protein dissociation process in MD simulations and estimate the free energy surface (FES). We constructed a program pipeline of MD simulations based on this sampling strategy, thus generating a dataset including 26,612 drug-protein dissociation trajectories containing about 13 million frames. We named this dissociation dynamics dataset DD-13M and used it to train a deep equivariant generative model UnbindingFlow, which can generate collision-free dissociation trajectories. The DD-13M database and UnbindingFlow model represent a significant advancement in computational structural biology, and we anticipate its broad applicability in machine learning studies of drug-protein interactions. Our ongoing efforts focus on expanding this methodology to encompass a broader spectrum of drug-protein complexes and exploring novel applications in pathway prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code will be accessed from our GitHub repository https://huggingface.co/SZBL-IDEA</p></details> |
| **[Achievable Rates and Error Probability Bounds of Frequency-based Channels of Unlimited Input Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18364v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a molecular channel, in which messages are encoded to the frequency of objects in a pool, and whose output during reading time is a noisy version of the input frequencies, as obtained by sampling with replacement from the pool. Motivated by recent DNA storage techniques, we focus on the regime in which the input resolution is unlimited. We propose two error probability bounds for this channel; the first bound is based on random coding analysis of the error probability of the maximum likelihood decoder and the second bound is derived by code expurgation techniques. We deduce an achievable bound on the capacity of this channel, and compare it to both the achievable bounds under limited input resolution, as well as to a converse bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing the morphology of molecular clouds without supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09832v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular clouds show complex structures reflecting their non-linear dynamics. Many studies investigating the bridge between their morphology and physical properties have shown the value of non-Gaussian higher-order statistics in capturing physical information. Yet, as this bridge is usually characterized in the supervised world of simulations, transferring it to observations can be hazardous, especially when the discrepancy between simulations and observations remains unknown. In this paper, we aim to identify relevant summary statistics, directly from the observation data. To do so, we developed a test to compare the informative power of two sets of summary statistics for a given unlabeled dataset. Contrary to supervised approaches, this test does not require knowledge of any class label or parameter associated with the data. Instead, it evaluates and compares the degeneracy levels of the summary statistics based on a notion of statistical compatibility. We applied this test to column density maps of 14 nearby molecular clouds observed by Herschel and iteratively compared different sets of typical summary statistics. We show that a standard Gaussian description of these clouds is highly degenerate but can be substantially improved when being estimated on the logarithm of the maps. This illustrates that low-order statistics, when properly used, remain very powerful. We further show that such descriptions still exhibit a small quantity of degeneracies, some of which are lifted by the higher-order statistics provided by reduced wavelet scattering transforms. These degeneracies quantitatively differ between observations and state-of-the-art simulations of dense cloud collapse, and they are not present for logFBM models. Finally, we show how to cooperatively use the summary statistics identified to build a morphological distance, which is evaluated visually and gives convincing results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exhaled Breath Analysis Through the Lens of Molecular Communication: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18326v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular Communication (MC) has long been envisioned to enable an Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) with medical applications, where nanomachines within the human body conduct monitoring, diagnosis, and therapy at micro- and nanoscale levels. MC involves information transfer via molecules and is supported by well-established theoretical models. However, practically achieving reliable, energy-efficient, and bio-compatible communication at these scales still remains a challenge. Air-Based Molecular Communication (ABMC) is a type of MC that operates over larger, meter-scale distances and extends even outside the human body. Therefore, devices and techniques to realize ABMC are readily accessible, and associated use cases can be very promising in the near future. Exhaled breath analysis has previously been proposed. It provides a non-invasive approach for health monitoring, leveraging existing commercial sensor technologies and reducing deployment barriers. The breath contains a diverse range of molecules and particles that serve as biomarkers linked to various physiological and pathological conditions. The plethora of proven methods, models, and optimization approaches in MC enable macroscale breath analysis, treating human as the transmitter, the breath as the information carrier, and macroscale sensors as the receiver. Using ABMC to interface with the inherent dynamic networks of cells, tissues, and organs could create a novel Internet of Bio Things (IoBT), a preliminary macroscale stage of the IoBNT. This survey extensively reviews exhaled breath modeling and analysis through the lens of MC, offering insights into theoretical frameworks and practical implementations from ABMC, bringing the IoBT a step closer to real-world use.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 2 tables, 12 figures.

| **[polyGen: A Learning Framework for Atomic-level Polymer Structure Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17656v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for their intrinsic structural flexibility.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies suggest that promoting \{beta}-arrestin-biased signaling in NTSR1 may diminish drugs of abuse, such as psychostimulants, thereby offering a potential avenue for treating human addiction-related disorders. In this study, we utilized a novel computational and experimental approach that combined nudged elastic band-based molecular dynamics simulations, Markov state models, temporal communication network analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and conformational biosensors, to explore the intricate mechanisms underlying NTSR1 activation and biased signaling. Our study reveals a dynamic stepwise transition mechanism and activated transmission network associated with NTSR1 activation. It also yields valuable insights into the complex interplay between the unique polar network, non-conserved ion locks, and aromatic clusters in NTSR1 signaling. Moreover, we identified a cryptic allosteric site located in the intracellular region of the receptor that exists in an intermediate state within the activation pathway. Collectively, these findings contribute to a more profound understanding of NTSR1 activation and biased signaling at the atomic level, thereby providing a potential strategy for the development of NTSR1 allosteric modulators in the realm of G protein-coupled receptor biology, biophysics, and medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAGE: Model-Level Graph Neural Networks Explanations via Motif-based Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12519v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in molecular tasks, yet their interpretability remains challenging. Traditional model-level explanation methods like XGNN and GNNInterpreter often fail to identify valid substructures like rings, leading to questionable interpretability. This limitation stems from XGNN's atom-by-atom approach and GNNInterpreter's reliance on average graph embeddings, which overlook the essential structural elements crucial for molecules. To address these gaps, we introduce an innovative \textbf{M}otif-b\textbf{A}sed \textbf{G}NN \textbf{E}xplainer (MAGE) that uses motifs as fundamental units for generating explanations. Our approach begins with extracting potential motifs through a motif decomposition technique. Then, we utilize an attention-based learning method to identify class-specific motifs. Finally, we employ a motif-based graph generator for each class to create molecular graph explanations based on these class-specific motifs. This novel method not only incorporates critical substructures into the explanations but also guarantees their validity, yielding results that are human-understandable. Our proposed method's effectiveness is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative assessments conducted on six real-world molecular datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.08419 The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations 2025</p></details> |

We utilize the geometric products between Clifford multivectors and the rich geometric information encoded in Clifford subspaces in \emph{Clifford Diffusion Models} (CDMs). We extend the diffusion process beyond just Clifford one-vectors to incorporate all higher-grade multivector subspaces. The data is embedded in grade-$k$ subspaces, allowing us to apply latent diffusion across complete multivectors. This enables CDMs to capture the joint distribution across different subspaces of the algebra, incorporating richer geometric information through higher-order features. We provide empirical results for unconditional molecular generation on the QM9 dataset, showing that CDMs provide a promising avenue for generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[A Comprehensive Review on RNA Subcellular Localization Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17162v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The subcellular localization of RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and other smaller RNAs, plays a critical role in determining their biological functions. For instance, lncRNAs are predominantly associated with chromatin and act as regulators of gene transcription and chromatin structure, while mRNAs are distributed across the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitating the transport of genetic information for protein synthesis. Understanding RNA localization sheds light on processes like gene expression regulation with spatial and temporal precision. However, traditional wet lab methods for determining RNA localization, such as in situ hybridization, are often time-consuming, resource-demanding, and costly. To overcome these challenges, computational methods leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful alternatives, enabling large-scale prediction of RNA subcellular localization. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in AI-based approaches for RNA subcellular localization prediction, covering various RNA types and focusing on sequence-based, image-based, and hybrid methodologies that combine both data types. We highlight the potential of these methods to accelerate RNA research, uncover molecular pathways, and guide targeted disease treatments. Furthermore, we critically discuss the challenges in AI/ML approaches for RNA subcellular localization, such as data scarcity and lack of benchmarks, and opportunities to address them. This review aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to develop innovative solutions in the field of RNA subcellular localization and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molecular Communication Channel as a Physical Reservoir Computer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17022v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular Communication (MC) channels inherently possess significant memory and nonlinear dynamics due to diffusion and receptor kinetics, often posing challenges for reliable data transmission. This work reconceptualizes these intrinsic properties as computational resources by framing a canonical point-to-point MC channel, consisting of ligand diffusion and reversible ligand-receptor binding at a spherical receiver, as a physical reservoir computer (PRC). We utilize the time-varying fraction of bound receptors as the reservoir's internal state, employing time-multiplexing to generate high-dimensional virtual nodes without explicit recurrence. Only a linear readout layer is trained via ridge regression. Through deterministic mean-field modeling and particle-based spatial stochastic simulations, we demonstrate the MC system's capability for complex temporal processing by successfully performing next-step prediction on standard chaotic time-series benchmarks (Mackey-Glass and NARMA10). Performance, quantified by Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on key system parameters (receptor kinetic rates, diffusion coefficient, transmitter-receiver distance), revealing optimal operational regimes. These findings validate the potential of using MC channel as effective and low-complexity computational substrate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparative Performance Evaluation of Large Language Models for Extracting Molecular Interactions and Pathway Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08813v4)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Identification of the interactions and regulatory relations between biomolecules play pivotal roles in understanding complex biological systems and the mechanisms underlying diverse biological functions. However, the collection of such molecular interactions has heavily relied on expert curation in the past, making it labor-intensive and time-consuming. To mitigate these challenges, we propose leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to automate genome-scale extraction of this crucial knowledge. Results: In this study, we investigate the efficacy of various LLMs in addressing biological tasks, such as the recognition of protein interactions, identification of genes linked to pathways affected by low-dose radiation, and the delineation of gene regulatory relationships. Overall, the larger models exhibited superior performance, indicating their potential for specific tasks that involve the extraction of complex interactions among genes and proteins. Although these models possessed detailed information for distinct gene and protein groups, they faced challenges in identifying groups with diverse functions and in recognizing highly correlated gene regulatory relationships. Conclusions: By conducting a comprehensive assessment of the state-of-the-art models using well-established molecular interaction and pathway databases, our study reveals that LLMs can identify genes/proteins associated with pathways of interest and predict their interactions to a certain extent. Furthermore, these models can provide important insights, marking a noteworthy stride toward advancing our understanding of biological systems through AI-assisted knowledge discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Molecule Generation and Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16559v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the joint distribution of the data samples and their properties allows to construct a single model for both data generation and property prediction, with synergistic capabilities reaching beyond purely generative or predictive models. However, training joint models presents daunting architectural and optimization challenges. Here, we propose Hyformer, a transformer-based joint model that successfully blends the generative and predictive functionalities, using an alternating attention mask together with a unified pre-training scheme. We show that Hyformer rivals other joint models, as well as state-of-the-art molecule generation and property prediction models. Additionally, we show the benefits of joint modeling in downstream tasks of molecular representation learning, hit identification and antimicrobial peptide design.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Novel Graph Transformer Framework for Gene Regulatory Network Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16961v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a foundational stride towards deciphering the fundamentals of complex biological systems. Inferring a possible regulatory link between two genes can be formulated as a link prediction problem. Inference of GRNs via gene coexpression profiling data may not always reflect true biological interactions, as its susceptibility to noise and misrepresenting true biological regulatory relationships. Most GRN inference methods face several challenges in the network reconstruction phase. Therefore, it is important to encode gene expression values, leverege the prior knowledge gained from the available inferred network structures and positional informations of the input network nodes towards inferring a better and more confident GRN network reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the integration of multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). Primarily, we employ autoencoder embeddings to capture gene expression patterns directly from raw data, preserving intricate biological signals. Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming them into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded with a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene across all networks. Additionally, we embed the positional encodings of the input gene networks to better identify the position of each unique gene within the graph. These embeddings are integrated into graph transformer-based model, termed GT-GRN, for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively utilizes the topological structure of the ground truth network while incorporating the enriched encoded information. Experimental results demonstrate that GT-GRN significantly outperforms existing GRN inference methods, achieving superior accuracy and highlighting the robustness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, lower errors on held out test sets do not always translate to improved results on downstream physical property prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose testing MLIPs on their practical ability to conserve energy during molecular dynamic simulations. If passed, improved correlations are found between test errors and their performance on physical property prediction tasks. We identify choices which may lead to models failing this test, and use these observations to improve upon highly-expressive models.

The size of datasets and demands of downstream workflows are growing rapidly, making robust and scalable software essential. This work presents a major overhaul of the NequIP framework focusing on multi-node parallelism, computational performance, and extensibility. The redesigned framework supports distributed training on large datasets and removes barriers preventing full utilization of the PyTorch 2.0 compiler at train time. We demonstrate this acceleration in a case study by training Allegro models on the SPICE 2 dataset of organic molecular systems. For inference, we introduce the first end-to-end infrastructure that uses the PyTorch Ahead-of-Time Inductor compiler for machine learning interatomic potentials. Additionally, we implement a custom kernel for the Allegro model's most expensive operation, the tensor product. Together, these advancements speed up molecular dynamics calculations on system sizes of practical relevance by up to a factor of 18.</p></details> |  |

By enforcing physical laws as constraints, PINN overcomes challenges with data scarsity and potentially high dimensionality. Existing PINN frameworks rely on fully observed time-course data, the acquisition of which could be prohibitive for many systems. In this study, we developed a new PINN learning paradigm, namely Constrained Learning, that enables the approximation of first-order derivatives or motions using non-time course or partially observed data. Computational principles and a general mathematical formulation of Constrained Learning were developed. We further introduced MPOCtrL (Message Passing Optimization-based Constrained Learning) an optimization approach tailored for the Constrained Learning framework that strives to balance the fitting of physical models and observed data. Its code is available at github link: https://github.com/ptdang1001/MPOCtrL Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrated that MPOCtrL can effectively detect the nonlinear dependency between observed data and the underlying physical properties of the system. In particular, on the task of metabolic flux analysis, MPOCtrL outperforms all existing data-driven flux estimators.</p></details> | 39 pages, 10 figures |

To address this challenge, we propose MetaMolGen, a first-order meta-learning-based molecular generator designed for few-shot and property-conditioned molecular generation. MetaMolGen standardizes the distribution of graph motifs by mapping them to a normalized latent space, and employs a lightweight autoregressive sequence model to generate SMILES sequences that faithfully reflect the underlying molecular structure. In addition, it supports conditional generation of molecules with target properties through a learnable property projector integrated into the generative process.Experimental results demonstrate that MetaMolGen consistently generates valid and diverse SMILES sequences under low-data regimes, outperforming conventional baselines.

However, neural network inference and long-range force computation remain the major bottlenecks, severely limiting simulation speed. In this paper, we target DPLR, a state-of-the-art NNMD package that supports long-range electrostatics, and propose a set of comprehensive optimizations to enhance computational efficiency. We introduce (1) a hardware-offloaded FFT method to reduce the communication overhead; (2) an overlapping strategy that hides long-range force computations using a single core per node, and (3) a ring-based load balancing method that enables atom-level task evenly redistribution with minimal communication overhead. Experimental results on the Fugaku supercomputer show that our work achieves a 37x performance improvement, reaching a maximum simulation speed of 51 ns/day.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

By constructing equivariant local frames with learnable geometric transitions, AlphaNet encodes atomic environments with enhanced representational capacity, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in energy and force predictions. Extensive benchmarks on large-scale datasets spanning molecular reactions, crystal stability, and surface catalysis (Matbench Discovery and OC2M) demonstrate its superior performance over existing neural network interatomic potentials while ensuring scalability across diverse system sizes with varying types of interatomic interactions.

Existing GNNs primarily operate in Euclidean spaces, which can limit their ability to capture hierarchical and multi-relational structures inherent to complex graphs. LGIN addresses this by incorporating curvature-aware aggregation functions that preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor, ensuring embeddings remain constrained within the hyperbolic space by proposing a new update rule that effectively captures both local neighborhood interactions and global structural properties, enabling LGIN to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs with expressiveness at least as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Through extensive evaluation across nine benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures, LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNNs, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy in modeling complex graph structures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to extend the concept of a powerful graph neural network to Riemannian manifolds, paving the way for future advancements in hyperbolic graph learning.

We introduce a new infinite family of coding schemes, which we name RLIM, that require each 1-bit to be followed by at least i consecutive 0-bits, where i is any chosen positive integer. This enhances ISI mitigation and improves error correction capabilities compared to existing ISI-mitigating channel codes. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the codebooks derived from the proposed RLIM scheme significantly reduce bit error rate compared to prominent coding methods. Simulation results also reveal that an important constraint in RLIM codes is redundant under zero-drift conditions, removal of which makes them equivalent to run-length-limited (RLL) codes. Notably, despite this equivalence, the proposed family of RLIM coding schemes retains a distinct power optimization constraint and employs a specialized error correction algorithm, preserving its unique character and advantages. Furthermore, in diffusion-based channels with time-varying drift, the previously redundant constraint becomes critical for ensuring robust detection, thus demonstrating the enhanced applicability of proposed RLIM codes for such channels as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

It is the first on-policy approach that allows significantly more gradient updates than the number of energy evaluations and model samples, allowing us to scale to much larger problem settings than previously explored by similar methods. Our framework is theoretically grounded in stochastic optimal control and shares the same theoretical guarantees as Adjoint Matching, being able to train without the need for corrective measures that push samples towards the target distribution. We show how to incorporate key symmetries, as well as periodic boundary conditions, for modeling molecules in both cartesian and torsional coordinates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on classical energy functions, and further scale up to neural network-based energy models where we perform amortized conformer generation across many molecular systems. To encourage further research in developing highly scalable sampling methods, we plan to open source these challenging benchmarks, where successful methods can directly impact progress in computational chemistry.</p></details> |  |

In the case of magnetic molecules, this conventional strategy has indeed led to the breakthrough of single-molecule magnets with working temperatures above nitrogen's boiling point, but at significant costs in terms of resources and time. Here, we propose a computational strategy able to accelerate the discovery of new coordination compounds with desired electronic and magnetic properties. Our approach is based on a combination of high-throughput multireference ab initio methods, genetic algorithms and machine learning. While genetic algorithms allow for an intelligent sampling of the vast chemical space available, machine learning reduces the computational cost by pre-screening molecular properties in advance of their accurate and automated multireference ab initio characterization. Importantly, the presented framework is able to generate novel organic ligands and explore chemical motifs beyond those available in pre-existing structural databases. We showcase the power of this approach by automatically generating new Co(II) mononuclear coordination compounds with record magnetic properties in a fraction of the time required by either experiments or brute-force ab initio approaches</p></details> |  |

Chirality plays a key role in determining drug safety and potency. To address this glaring issue, we introduce a novel field-based representation, proposing reference rotations that replace rotational symmetry constraints. The proposed model captures all molecular geometries including chirality, while still achieving highly competitive performance with E(3)-based methods across standard benchmarking metrics.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Existing methods primarily focus on extracting a single causal subgraph from the input graph to achieve generalizable predictions. However, relying on a single subgraph can lead to susceptibility to spurious correlations and is insufficient for learning invariant patterns behind graph data. Moreover, in many real-world applications, such as molecular property prediction, multiple critical subgraphs may influence the target label property. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, SubGraph Aggregation (SuGAr), designed to learn a diverse set of subgraphs that are crucial for OOD generalization on graphs. Specifically, SuGAr employs a tailored subgraph sampler and diversity regularizer to extract a diverse set of invariant subgraphs. These invariant subgraphs are then aggregated by averaging their representations, which enriches the subgraph signals and enhances coverage of the underlying causal structures, thereby improving OOD generalization. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that \ours outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 24% improvement in OOD generalization on graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study graph OOD generalization by learning multiple invariant subgraphs. code: https://github.com/Nanolbw/SuGAr</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Our approach relies solely on learnt embeddings, obviating the need for auxiliary labels, thus extending the benefits of heterophily-aware embeddings to broader applications, e.g., generative modelling.

Machine learning-based approaches for de-novo molecular generation have recently garnered significant attention. This paper introduces a transformer-based vector embedding generator combined with a modified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate molecules with desired properties. The embedding generator utilizes a novel molecular descriptor, integrating Morgan fingerprints with global molecular attributes, enabling the transformer to capture local functional groups and broader molecular characteristics. Modifying the GAN generator loss function ensures the generation of molecules with specific desired properties. The transformer achieves a reconversion accuracy of 94% while translating molecular descriptors back to SMILES strings, validating the utility of the proposed embeddings for generative tasks. The approach is validated by generating novel odorant molecules using a labeled dataset of odorant and non-odorant compounds. With the modified range-loss function, the GAN exclusively generates odorant molecules. This work underscores the potential of combining novel vector embeddings with transformers and modified GAN architectures to accelerate the discovery of tailored molecules, offering a robust tool for diverse molecular design applications.</p></details> |  |

Most methods in previous studies learn the semantics and syntax of molecular structures by analyzing molecular graphs or simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings; however, they do not take into account the drug responses of the biological systems consisting of genes and proteins. In this study we propose a hybrid neural network, HNN2Mol, which utilizes gene expression profiles to generate molecular structures with desirable phenotypes for arbitrary target proteins. In the algorithm, a variational autoencoder is employed as a feature extractor to learn the latent feature distribution of the gene expression profiles. Then, a long short-term memory is leveraged as the chemical generator to produce syntactically valid SMILES strings that satisfy the feature conditions of the gene expression profile extracted by the feature extractor. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that the proposed HNN2Mol model can produce new molecules with potential bioactivities and drug-like properties.</p></details> |  |

Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the "dark chemical space" without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Generative modeling would shift the paradigm from relying on large-scale chemical screening to find molecules with desired properties to directly generating those molecules. However, multi-modal models combining text and molecules are often trained from scratch, without leveraging existing high-quality pretrained models. Training from scratch consumes more computational resources and prohibits model scaling. In contrast, we propose a lightweight adapter-based strategy named Chemical Language Model Linker (ChemLML). ChemLML blends the two single domain models and obtains conditional molecular generation from text descriptions while still operating in the specialized embedding spaces of the molecular domain. ChemLML can tailor diverse pretrained text models for molecule generation by training relatively few adapter parameters. We find that the choice of molecular representation used within ChemLML, SMILES versus SELFIES, has a strong influence on conditional molecular generation performance. SMILES is often preferable despite not guaranteeing valid molecules. We raise issues in using the entire PubChem dataset of molecules and their associated descriptions for evaluating molecule generation and provide a filtered version of the dataset as a generation test set. To demonstrate how ChemLML could be used in practice, we generate candidate protein inhibitors and use docking to assess their quality and also generate candidate membrane permeable molecules.</p></details> | 60 pages, 12 figures |

However, existing models are affected by hallucination issues, resulting in errors in drug design and utilization. In this paper, we first analyze the sources of hallucination in LLMs for molecular comprehension tasks, specifically the knowledge shortcut phenomenon observed in the PubChem dataset. To evaluate hallucination in molecular comprehension tasks with computational efficiency, we introduce \textbf{Mol-Hallu}, a novel free-form evaluation metric that quantifies the degree of hallucination based on the scientific entailment relationship between generated text and actual molecular properties. Utilizing the Mol-Hallu metric, we reassess and analyze the extent of hallucination in various LLMs performing molecular comprehension tasks. Furthermore, the Hallucination Reduction Post-processing stage~(HRPP) is proposed to alleviate molecular hallucinations, Experiments show the effectiveness of HRPP on decoder-only and encoder-decoder molecular LLMs. Our findings provide critical insights into mitigating hallucination and improving the reliability of LLMs in scientific applications.</p></details> | 17 pages |

However, while performing well at capturing distributions of molecular motifs, they often produce synthetically inaccessible molecules. To address this, we introduce SynFlowNet, a GFlowNet model whose action space uses chemical reactions and purchasable reactants to sequentially build new molecules. By incorporating forward synthesis as an explicit constraint of the generative mechanism, we aim at bridging the gap between in silico molecular generation and real world synthesis capabilities. We evaluate our approach using synthetic accessibility scores and an independent retrosynthesis tool to assess the synthesizability of our compounds, and motivate the choice of GFlowNets through considerable improvement in sample diversity compared to baselines. Additionally, we identify challenges with reaction encodings that can complicate traversal of the MDP in the backward direction. To address this, we introduce various strategies for learning the GFlowNet backward policy and thus demonstrate how additional constraints can be integrated into the GFlowNet MDP framework. This approach enables our model to successfully identify synthesis pathways for previously unseen molecules.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent studies, which demonstrate that diffusion model, a prominent generative approach, can learn meaningful data representations that enhance predictive tasks, we explore the potential for developing a unified generative model in the molecular domain that effectively addresses both molecular generation and property prediction tasks. However, the integration of these tasks is challenging due to inherent inconsistencies, making simple multi-task learning ineffective. To address this, we propose UniGEM, the first unified model to successfully integrate molecular generation and property prediction, delivering superior performance in both tasks. Our key innovation lies in a novel two-phase generative process, where predictive tasks are activated in the later stages, after the molecular scaffold is formed. We further enhance task balance through innovative training strategies. Rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in both tasks. The principles behind UniGEM hold promise for broader applications, including natural language processing and computer vision.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Unified Latent Space for 3D Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15567v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[De Novo Molecular Design Enabled by Direct Preference Optimization and Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01389v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>De novo molecular design has extensive applications in drug discovery and materials science. The vast chemical space renders direct molecular searches computationally prohibitive, while traditional experimental screening is both time- and labor-intensive. Efficient molecular generation and screening methods are therefore essential for accelerating drug discovery and reducing costs. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to optimize molecular properties via reward mechanisms, its practical utility is limited by issues in training efficiency, convergence, and stability. To address these challenges, we adopt Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) from NLP, which uses molecular score-based sample pairs to maximize the likelihood difference between high- and low-quality molecules, effectively guiding the model toward better compounds. Moreover, integrating curriculum learning further boosts training efficiency and accelerates convergence. A systematic evaluation of the proposed method on the GuacaMol Benchmark yielded excellent scores. For instance, the method achieved a score of 0.883 on the Perindopril MPO task, representing a 6\% improvement over competing models. And subsequent target protein binding experiments confirmed its practical efficacy. These results demonstrate the strong potential of DPO for molecular design tasks and highlight its effectiveness as a robust and efficient solution for data-driven drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

However, the prediction and interpretation of these sequences remain challenging due to the intricate nature of genetic material. Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for biological sequence analysis. Recent developments in genomic language models have underscored the potential of LLMs in deciphering DNA sequences. Nonetheless, existing models often face limitations in robustness and application scope, primarily due to constraints in model structure and training data scale. To address these limitations, we present GENERator, a generative genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 98k base pairs (bp) and 1.2B parameters. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386B bp of eukaryotic DNA, the GENERator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both established and newly proposed benchmarks. The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology, accurately generating protein-coding sequences that translate into proteins structurally analogous to known families. It also shows significant promise in sequence optimization, particularly through the prompt-responsive generation of enhancer sequences with specific activity profiles. These capabilities position the GENERator as a pivotal tool for genomic research and biotechnological advancement, enhancing our ability to interpret and predict complex biological systems and enabling precise genomic interventions.

While recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of all-atom foundation models for molecular modeling and generation, existing approaches face challenges in generalization due to the multi-modal nature of atomic data and the lack of comprehensive analysis of training and sampling strategies. To address these limitations, we propose PharMolixFM, a unified framework for constructing all-atom foundation models based on multi-modal generative techniques. Our framework includes three variants using state-of-the-art multi-modal generative models. By formulating molecular tasks as a generalized denoising process with task-specific priors, PharMolixFM achieves robust performance across various structural biology applications. Experimental results demonstrate that PharMolixFM-Diff achieves competitive prediction accuracy in protein-small-molecule docking (83.9% vs. 90.2% RMSD < 2{\AA}, given pocket) with significantly improved inference speed. Moreover, we explore the empirical inference scaling law by introducing more sampling repeats or steps. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/PharMolix/OpenBioMed.</p></details> |  |
| **[GP-MoLFormer: A Foundation Model For Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04912v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models trained on large and general purpose datasets consisting of molecular strings have recently emerged as a powerful tool for successfully modeling various structure-property relations. Inspired by this success, we extend the paradigm of training chemical language transformers on large-scale chemical datasets to generative tasks in this work. Specifically, we propose GP-MoLFormer, an autoregressive molecular string generator that is trained on more than 1.1B (billion) chemical SMILES. GP-MoLFormer uses a 46.8M parameter transformer decoder model with linear attention and rotary positional encodings as the base architecture. GP-MoLFormer's utility is evaluated and compared with that of existing baselines on three different tasks: de novo generation, scaffold-constrained molecular decoration, and unconstrained property-guided optimization. While the first two are handled with no additional training, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for the last task, which uses property-ordered molecular pairs as input. We call this new approach pair-tuning. Our results show GP-MoLFormer performs better or comparable with baselines across all three tasks, demonstrating its general utility for a variety of molecular generation tasks. We further report strong memorization of training data in GP-MoLFormer generations, which has so far remained unexplored for chemical language models. Our analyses reveal that training data memorization and novelty in generations are impacted by the quality and scale of the training data; duplication bias in training data can enhance memorization at the cost of lowering novelty. We further establish a scaling law relating inference compute and novelty in generations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Make Autoregressive Great Again: Diffusion-Free Graph Generation with Next-Scale Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23612v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models are popular generative models due to their speed and properties. However, they require an explicit sequence order, which contradicts the unordered nature of graphs. In contrast, diffusion models maintain permutation invariance and enable one-shot generation but require up to thousands of denoising steps and additional features, leading to high computational costs. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in image generation-especially the success of visual autoregressive methods-we propose MAG, a novel diffusion-free graph generation framework based on next-scale prediction. By leveraging a hierarchy of latent representations, the model progressively generates scales of the entire graph without the need for explicit node ordering. Extensive experiments on both generic and molecular graph datasets demonstrate that MAG delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to three orders of magnitude in speedup during inference.</p></details> | Draft #1 |
| **[Fast Direct: Query-Efficient Online Black-box Guidance for Diffusion-model Target Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01692v5)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guided diffusion-model generation is a promising direction for customizing the generation process of a pre-trained diffusion model to address specific downstream tasks. Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/kimyong95/guide-stable-diffusion/tree/fast-direct</p></details> |  |

However, existing SBDD methods often overlook two key challenges: (1) the multi-modal nature of this task and (2) the causal relationship between these modalities, limiting their plausibility and performance. To address both challenges, we propose TransDiffSBDD, an integrated framework combining autoregressive transformers and diffusion models for SBDD. Specifically, the autoregressive transformer models discrete molecular information, while the diffusion model samples continuous distributions, effectively resolving the first challenge. To address the second challenge, we design a hybrid-modal sequence for protein-ligand complexes that explicitly respects the causality between modalities. Experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark demonstrate that TransDiffSBDD outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Previous works in this framework often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on a subset of ZINC dataset, and by employing robust evaluation metrics we show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods for a wide range of drug design tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.09702</p></details> |

Existing generative methods are restricted to single-domain molecules, failing to address versatile therapeutic needs or utilize cross-domain transferability to enhance model performance. In this paper, we introduce Unified generative Modeling of 3D Molecules (UniMoMo), the first framework capable of designing binders of multiple molecular domains using a single model. In particular, UniMoMo unifies the representations of different molecules as graphs of blocks, where each block corresponds to either a standard amino acid or a molecular fragment. Based on these unified representations, UniMoMo utilizes a geometric latent diffusion model for 3D molecular generation, featuring an iterative full-atom autoencoder to compress blocks into latent space points, followed by an E(3)-equivariant diffusion process. Extensive benchmarks across peptides, antibodies, and small molecules demonstrate the superiority of our unified framework over existing domain-specific models, highlighting the benefits of multi-domain training.</p></details> | preprint |

While chemical Language Models (cLMs) have made strides in learning molecular properties, most fail to incorporate target-specific insights, restricting their ability to drive de-novo ligand generation. Chem42, a cutting-edge family of generative chemical Language Models, is designed to bridge this gap. By integrating atomic-level interactions with multimodal inputs from Prot42, a complementary protein Language Model, Chem42 achieves a sophisticated cross-modal representation of molecular structures, interactions, and binding patterns. This innovative framework enables the creation of structurally valid, synthetically accessible ligands with enhanced target specificity. Evaluations across diverse protein targets confirm that Chem42 surpasses existing approaches in chemical validity, target-aware design, and predicted binding affinity. By reducing the search space of viable drug candidates, Chem42 could accelerate the drug discovery pipeline, offering a powerful generative AI tool for precision medicine. Our Chem42 models set a new benchmark in molecule property prediction, conditional molecule generation, and target-aware ligand design. The models are publicly available at huggingface.co/inceptionai.</p></details> |  |
| **[Potential Score Matching: Debiasing Molecular Structure Sampling with Potential Energy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14569v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Despite their widespread occurrence, there remains a gap in modeling particle propagation through these complex structures from a molecular communication (MC) perspective. This paper introduces a generalized analytical framework for modeling diffusion-based molecular communication in multi-layered spherical environments. The framework is capable of supporting an arbitrary number of layers and flexible transmitter-receiver positioning. As an example, the detailed formulation is presented for the three-layer sphere, which is particularly relevant for different biological models such as tumor spheroids. The analytical results are validated using particle-based simulation (PBS) in scenarios that have short inter-layer distances. The findings reveal that the characteristics of each layer significantly impact molecule propagation throughout the entire structure, making their consideration crucial for designing targeted therapies and optimizing drug delivery systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; accepted to be presented in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Communication</p></details> |
| **[A Reinforcement Learning-Driven Transformer GAN for Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12796v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating molecules with desired chemical properties presents a critical challenge in fields such as chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have significantly contributed to data-driven molecular generation. However, challenges persist due to the inherent sensitivity of simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) representations and the difficulties in applying generative adversarial networks (GANs) to discrete data. This study introduces RL-MolGAN, a novel Transformer-based discrete GAN framework designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional Transformer architectures, RL-MolGAN utilizes a first-decoder-then-encoder structure, facilitating the generation of drug-like molecules from both $de~novo$ and scaffold-based designs. In addition, RL-MolGAN integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) techniques to enhance the stability of GAN training and optimize the chemical properties of the generated molecules. To further improve the model's performance, RL-MolWGAN, an extension of RL-MolGAN, incorporates Wasserstein distance and mini-batch discrimination, which together enhance the stability of the GAN. Experimental results on two widely used molecular datasets, QM9 and ZINC, validate the effectiveness of our models in generating high-quality molecular structures with diverse and desirable chemical properties.</p></details> |  |

Designed to support AI-driven drug design and discovery, M$^{3}$-20M is 71 times more in the number of molecules than the largest existing dataset, providing an unprecedented scale that can highly benefit the training or fine-tuning of models, including large language models for drug design and discovery tasks. This dataset integrates one-dimensional SMILES, two-dimensional molecular graphs, three-dimensional molecular structures, physicochemical properties, and textual descriptions collected through web crawling and generated using GPT-3.5, offering a comprehensive view of each molecule. To demonstrate the power of M$^{3}$-20M in drug design and discovery, we conduct extensive experiments on two key tasks: molecule generation and molecular property prediction, using large language models including GLM4, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama3-8b. Our experimental results show that M$^{3}$-20M can significantly boost model performance in both tasks. Specifically, it enables the models to generate more diverse and valid molecular structures and achieve higher property prediction accuracy than existing single-modal datasets, which validates the value and potential of M$^{3}$-20M in supporting AI-driven drug design and discovery.

| **[Probabilistic Graph Circuits: Deep Generative Models for Tractable Probabilistic Inference over Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12162v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models (DGMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in capturing complex probability distributions over graphs. Although their excellent performance is attributed to powerful and scalable deep neural networks, it is, at the same time, exactly the presence of these highly non-linear transformations that makes DGMs intractable. Indeed, despite representing probability distributions, intractable DGMs deny probabilistic foundations by their inability to answer even the most basic inference queries without approximations or design choices specific to a very narrow range of queries. To address this limitation, we propose probabilistic graph circuits (PGCs), a framework of tractable DGMs that provide exact and efficient probabilistic inference over (arbitrary parts of) graphs. Nonetheless, achieving both exactness and efficiency is challenging in the permutation-invariant setting of graphs. We design PGCs that are inherently invariant and satisfy these two requirements, yet at the cost of low expressive power. Therefore, we investigate two alternative strategies to achieve the invariance: the first sacrifices the efficiency, and the second sacrifices the exactness. We demonstrate that ignoring the permutation invariance can have severe consequences in anomaly detection, and that the latter approach is competitive with, and sometimes better than, existing intractable DGMs in the context of molecular graph generation.</p></details> |  |

While these pesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning applications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or regression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular structures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Pesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders, designed to create pesticide candidates with optimized properties for the first time. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an initial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure representation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates toxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple toxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity to generate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Notably, Pesti-Gen achieves approximately 68\% structural validity in generating new molecular structures, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in producing optimized and feasible pesticide candidates, thereby providing a new way for safer and more sustainable pest management solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the RECOMB 2025 Poster Track</p></details> |

This success is largely attributed to the effectiveness of molecular tokenization strategies. In protein science, the amino acid sequence serves as the sole tokenizer for LLMs. However, many fundamental challenges in protein science are inherently structure-dependent. The absence of structure-aware tokens significantly limits the capabilities of LLMs for comprehensive biomolecular comprehension and multimodal generation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, ProtTeX, which tokenizes the protein sequences, structures, and textual information into a unified discrete space. This innovative approach enables joint training of the LLM exclusively through the Next-Token Prediction paradigm, facilitating multimodal protein reasoning and generation. ProtTeX enables general LLMs to perceive and process protein structures through sequential text input, leverage structural information as intermediate reasoning components, and generate or manipulate structures via sequential text output. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in protein function prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art domain expert model with a twofold increase in accuracy. Our framework enables high-quality conformational generation and customizable protein design. For the first time, we demonstrate that by adopting the standard training and inference pipelines from the LLM domain, ProtTeX empowers decoder-only LLMs to effectively address diverse spectrum of protein-related tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |

These models can be guided in two ways: (i) explicitly, through additional features representing the condition, or (ii) implicitly, using a property predictor. However, training property predictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled data and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a novel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled datasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a non-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of relying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form of estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a conditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this results in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular structures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly reduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used for stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit guidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular properties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular optimization tasks beyond stability optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing molecular generation methods present significant limitations: those operating at the atomic level often lack synthetic feasibility, drug-likeness, and interpretability, while fragment-based approaches frequently overlook comprehensive factors that influence protein-molecule interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel fragment-based molecular generation framework tailored for specific proteins. Our method begins by constructing a protein subpocket and molecular arm concept-based neural network, which systematically integrates interaction force information and geometric complementarity to sample molecular arms for specific protein subpockets. Subsequently, we introduce a diffusion model to generate molecular backbones that connect these arms, ensuring structural integrity and chemical diversity. Our approach significantly improves synthetic feasibility and binding affinity, with a 4% increase in drug-likeness and a 6% improvement in synthetic feasibility. Furthermore, by integrating explicit interaction data through a concept-based model, our framework enhances interpretability, offering valuable insights into the molecular design process.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Graph2Token, an efficient solution that aligns graph tokens to LLM tokens. The key idea is to represent a graph token with the LLM token vocabulary, without fine-tuning the LLM backbone. To achieve this goal, we first construct a molecule-text paired dataset from multisources, including CHEBI and HMDB, to train a graph structure encoder, which reduces the distance between graphs and texts representations in the feature space. Then, we propose a novel alignment strategy that associates a graph token with LLM tokens. To further unleash the potential of LLMs, we collect molecular IUPAC name identifiers, which are incorporated into the LLM prompts. By aligning molecular graphs as special tokens, we can activate LLM generalization ability to molecular few-shot learning. Extensive experiments on molecular classification and regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Graph2Token.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 camera ready version</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of manual annotation for biochemical properties, the performance for molecule generation tasks is still limited, especially for tasks involving multi-properties constraints. In this work, we present a two-step framework PEIT (Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning) to improve LLMs for molecular-related tasks. In the first step, we use textual descriptions, SMILES, and biochemical properties as multimodal inputs to pre-train a model called PEIT-GEN, by aligning multi-modal representations to synthesize instruction data. In the second step, we fine-tune existing open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the resulting PEIT-LLM can handle molecule captioning, text-based molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and our newly proposed multi-constraint molecule generation tasks. Experimental results show that our pre-trained PEIT-GEN outperforms MolT5 and BioT5 in molecule captioning, demonstrating modalities align well between textual descriptions, structures, and biochemical properties. Furthermore, PEIT-LLM shows promising improvements in multi-task molecule generation, proving the scalability of the PEIT framework for various molecular tasks.

While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an \emph{order-policy}, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the exact log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation. On the challenging domain of molecular graph generation, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k benchmarks, evaluated using the Fr\'{e}chet ChemNet Distance (FCD).</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a Python-based algorithm that automates the generation of reaction templates for the LAMMPS REACTION package, leveraging graph-theoretical principles and sub-graph isomorphism techniques. By representing molecular systems as mathematical graphs, the method enables automated identification of conserved molecular domains, reaction sites, and atom mappings, significantly reducing manual effort. The algorithm was validated on three case studies: poly-addition, poly-condensation, and chain polymerization, demonstrating its ability to map conserved regions, identify reaction-initiating atoms, and resolve challenges such as symmetric reactants and indistinguishable atoms. Additionally, the generated templates were optimized for computational efficiency by retaining only essential reactive domains, ensuring scalability and consistency in high-throughput workflows for computational chemistry, materials science, and machine learning applications. Future work will focus on extending the method to mixed organic-inorganic systems, incorporating adaptive scoring mechanisms, and integrating quantum mechanical calculations to enhance its applicability.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we introduce a novel Straight-Line Diffusion Model (SLDM) to tackle this problem, by formulating the diffusion process to follow a linear trajectory. The proposed process aligns well with the noise sensitivity characteristic of molecular structures and uniformly distributes reconstruction effort across the generative process, thus enhancing learning efficiency and efficacy. Consequently, SLDM achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D molecule generation benchmarks, delivering a 100-fold improvement in sampling efficiency. Furthermore, experiments on toy data and image generation tasks validate the generality and robustness of SLDM, showcasing its potential across diverse generative modeling domains.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we have developed P2DFlow, a generative model based on SE(3) flow matching, to predict the structural ensembles of proteins. We specifically designed a valuable prior for the flow process and enhanced the model's ability to distinguish each intermediate state by incorporating an additional dimension to describe the ensemble data, which can reflect the physical laws governing the distribution of ensembles, so that the prior knowledge can effectively guide the generation process. When trained and evaluated on the MD datasets of ATLAS, P2DFlow outperforms other baseline models on extensive experiments, successfully capturing the observable dynamic fluctuations as evidenced in crystal structure and MD simulations. As a potential proxy agent for protein molecular simulation, the high-quality ensembles generated by P2DFlow could significantly aid in understanding protein functions across various scenarios.

| **[Dynamic Search for Inference-Time Alignment in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02039v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown promising generative capabilities across diverse domains, yet aligning their outputs with desired reward functions remains a challenge, particularly in cases where reward functions are non-differentiable. Some gradient-free guidance methods have been developed, but they often struggle to achieve optimal inference-time alignment. In this work, we newly frame inference-time alignment in diffusion as a search problem and propose Dynamic Search for Diffusion (DSearch), which subsamples from denoising processes and approximates intermediate node rewards. It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in atom- and motif-wise deep learning models for 3D molecular generation, current methods often struggle with validity and reliability. To address these issues, we develop the Atom-Motif Consistency Diffusion Model (AMDiff), utilizing a joint-training paradigm for multi-view learning. This model features a hierarchical diffusion architecture that integrates both atom- and motif-level views of molecules, allowing for comprehensive exploration of complementary information. By leveraging classifier-free guidance and incorporating binding site features as conditional inputs, AMDiff ensures robust molecule generation across diverse targets. Compared to existing approaches, AMDiff exhibits superior validity and novelty in generating molecules tailored to fit various protein pockets. Case studies targeting protein kinases, including Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) and Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), demonstrate the model's capability in structure-based de novo drug design. Overall, AMDiff bridges the gap between atom-view and motif-view drug discovery and speeds up the process of target-aware molecular generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

SymDiff resembles a learned data augmentation that is deployed at sampling time, and is lightweight, computationally efficient, and easy to implement on top of arbitrary off-the-shelf models. In contrast to previous work, SymDiff typically does not require any neural network components that are intrinsically equivariant, avoiding the need for complex parameterisations or the use of higher-order geometric features. Instead, our method can leverage highly scalable modern architectures as drop-in replacements for these more constrained alternatives. We show that this additional flexibility yields significant empirical benefit for $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariant molecular generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of symmetrisation to generative modelling, suggesting its potential in this domain more generally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods fall into PC-Free and PC-Aware categories based on their use of 3D point clouds (PC). PC-Free models prioritize diversity but suffer from lower validity due to overlooking PC constraints, while PC-Aware models ensure higher validity but restrict diversity by enforcing strict PC constraints. To overcome these trade-offs without additional training, we propose HybridLinker, a framework that enhances PC-Aware inference by providing diverse bonding topologies from a pretrained PC-Free model as guidance. At its core, we propose LinkerDPS, the first diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) method operating across PC-Free and PC-Aware spaces, bridging molecular topology with 3D point clouds via an energy-inspired function. By transferring the diverse sampling distribution of PC-Free models into the PC-Aware distribution, HybridLinker significantly and consistently surpasses baselines, improving both validity and diversity in foundational molecular design and applied property optimization tasks, establishing a new DPS framework in the molecular and graph domains beyond imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Auto-encoding Molecules: Graph-Matching Capabilities Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00426v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoencoders are effective deep learning models that can function as generative models and learn latent representations for downstream tasks. The use of graph autoencoders - with both encoder and decoder implemented as message passing networks - is intriguing due to their ability to generate permutation-invariant graph representations. However, this approach faces difficulties because decoding a graph structure from a single vector is challenging, and comparing input and output graphs requires an effective permutation-invariant similarity measure. As a result, many studies rely on approximate methods. In this work, we explore the effect of graph matching precision on the training behavior and generation capabilities of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we propose a transformer-based message passing graph decoder as an alternative to a graph neural network decoder, that is more robust and expressive by leveraging global attention mechanisms. (2) We show that the precision of graph matching has significant impact on training behavior and is essential for effective de novo (molecular) graph generation.

Current approaches, however, often suffer from very slow sampling times or generate molecules with poor chemical validity. Addressing these limitations, we propose Semla, a scalable E(3)-equivariant message passing architecture. We further introduce an unconditional 3D molecular generation model, SemlaFlow, which is trained using equivariant flow matching to generate a joint distribution over atom types, coordinates, bond types and formal charges. Our model produces state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with as few as 20 sampling steps, corresponding to a two order-of-magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight limitations of current evaluation methods for 3D generation and propose new benchmark metrics for unconditional molecular generators. Finally, using these new metrics, we compare our model's ability to generate high quality samples against current approaches and further demonstrate SemlaFlow's strong performance.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |

Language models and graph-based models are extensively utilized within this domain, consistently achieving state-of-the-art results across an array of tasks. However, the prevailing practice of representing chemical compounds in the SMILES format -- used by most datasets and many language models -- presents notable limitations as a training data format. In contrast, chemical fingerprints offer a more physically informed representation of compounds, thereby enhancing their suitability for model training. This study aims to develop a language model that is specifically trained on fingerprints. Furthermore, we introduce a bimodal architecture that integrates this language model with a graph model. Our proposed methodology synthesizes these approaches, utilizing RoBERTa as the language model and employing Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graphormer as graph models. This integration results in a significant improvement in predictive performance compared to conventional strategies for tasks such as Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) and the prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, among others.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, retrieval-augmented generation has become a principled approach commonly used with language models. However, the optimal integration of retrieval augmentation into molecular machine learning remains unclear. Graph neural networks stand to benefit from clever matching to understand the structural alignment of retrieved molecules to a query molecule. Neural graph matching offers a compelling solution by explicitly modeling node and edge affinities between two structural graphs while employing a noise-robust, end-to-end neural network to learn affinity metrics. We apply this approach to mass spectrum simulation and introduce MARASON, a novel model that incorporates neural graph matching to enhance a fragmentation-based neural network. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our design, with MARASON achieving 28% top-1 accuracy, a substantial improvement over the non-retrieval state-of-the-art accuracy of 19%. Moreover, MARASON outperforms both naive retrieval-augmented generation methods and traditional graph matching approaches.</p></details> |  |

The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.</p></details> |  |

Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in interpreting molecular structures, their instruction datasets are limited to the specific knowledge from task-oriented datasets and do not fully cover the fundamental characteristics of molecules, hindering their abilities as general-purpose molecular assistants. To address this issue, we propose Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules via multi-modal instruction tuning. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental features of molecules, incorporating essential knowledge from molecular structures. In addition, to improve understanding of molecular features, we introduce a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of different molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and generating relevant responses to users' queries with detailed explanations, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.

Traditional generative models often struggle with limited training data, particularly in drug discovery, where molecular datasets for specific therapeutic targets, such as nucleic acids binders and central nervous system (CNS) drugs, are scarce. ADSeqGAN addresses this challenge by integrating an auxiliary random forest classifier as an additional discriminator into the GAN framework, significantly improves molecular generation quality and class specificity. Our method incorporates pretrained generator and Wasserstein distance to enhance training stability and diversity. We evaluate ADSeqGAN on a dataset comprising nucleic acid-targeting and protein-targeting small molecules, demonstrating its superior ability to generate nucleic acid binders compared to baseline models such as SeqGAN, ORGAN, and MolGPT. Through an oversampling strategy, ADSeqGAN also significantly improves CNS drug generation, achieving a higher yield than traditional de novo models. Critical assessments, including docking simulations and molecular property analysis, confirm that ADSeqGAN-generated molecules exhibit strong binding affinities, enhanced chemical diversity, and improved synthetic feasibility. Overall, ADSeqGAN presents a novel framework for generative molecular design in data-scarce scenarios, offering potential applications in computational drug discovery. We have demonstrated the successful applications of ADSeqGAN in generating synthetic nucleic acid-targeting and CNS drugs in this work.</p></details> |  |

While supervised learning methods generate high-quality molecules similar to those in a dataset, they struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution properties. Reinforcement learning can explore new chemical spaces but often conducts 'reward-hacking' and generates non-synthesizable molecules. In this work, we address this problem by integrating a state-of-the-art supervised learning method, STGG+, in an active learning loop. Our approach iteratively generates, evaluates, and fine-tunes STGG+ to continuously expand its knowledge. We denote this approach STGG+AL. We apply STGG+AL to the design of organic $\pi$-functional materials, specifically two challenging tasks: 1) generating highly absorptive molecules characterized by high oscillator strength and 2) designing absorptive molecules with reasonable oscillator strength in the near-infrared (NIR) range. The generated molecules are validated and rationalized in-silico with time-dependent density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that our method is highly effective in generating novel molecules with high oscillator strength, contrary to existing methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We open-source our active-learning code along with our Conjugated-xTB dataset containing 2.9 million $\pi$-conjugated molecules and the function for approximating the oscillator strength and absorption wavelength (based on sTDA-xTB).</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/STGG-AL</p></details> |

Notably, FragFM achieves over 99\% validity with significantly fewer sampling steps, improving scalability while preserving molecular diversity.

Existing methods primarily focus on single-scale features, overlooking the hierarchical molecular structures that determine different molecular properties. To address these issues, we introduce Universal Matching Networks (UniMatch), a dual matching framework that integrates explicit hierarchical molecular matching with implicit task-level matching via meta-learning, bridging multi-level molecular representations and task-level generalization. Specifically, our approach explicitly captures structural features across multiple levels, such as atoms, substructures, and molecules, via hierarchical pooling and matching, facilitating precise molecular representation and comparison. Additionally, we employ a meta-learning strategy for implicit task-level matching, allowing the model to capture shared patterns across tasks and quickly adapt to new ones. This unified matching framework ensures effective molecular alignment while leveraging shared meta-knowledge for fast adaptation. Our experimental results demonstrate that UniMatch outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the MoleculeNet and FS-Mol benchmarks, achieving improvements of 2.87% in AUROC and 6.52% in delta AUPRC. UniMatch also shows excellent generalization ability on the Meta-MolNet benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as ICLR 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Diverse Molecules? Towards Alignment with Structural Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03138v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in molecular generation, which offers potential to accelerate drug discovery. However, the current LLMs overlook a critical requirement for drug discovery: proposing a diverse set of molecules. This diversity is essential for improving the chances of finding a viable drug, as it provides alternative molecules that may succeed where others fail in real-world validations. Nevertheless, the LLMs often output structurally similar molecules. While decoding schemes like diverse beam search may enhance textual diversity, this often does not align with molecular structural diversity. In response, we propose a new method for fine-tuning molecular generative LLMs to autoregressively generate a set of structurally diverse molecules, where each molecule is generated by conditioning on the previously generated molecules. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) supervised fine-tuning to adapt LLMs to autoregressively generate molecules in a sequence and (2) reinforcement learning to maximize structural diversity within the generated molecules. Our experiments show that the proposed approach enables LLMs to generate diverse molecules better than existing approaches for diverse sequence generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MING: A Functional Approach to Learning Molecular Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12522v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional molecule generation methods often rely on sequence- or graph-based representations, which can limit their expressive power or require complex permutation-equivariant architectures. This paper introduces a novel paradigm for learning molecule generative models based on functional representations. Specifically, we propose Molecular Implicit Neural Generation (MING), a diffusion-based model that learns molecular distributions in the function space. Unlike standard diffusion processes in the data space, MING employs a novel functional denoising probabilistic process, which jointly denoises information in both the function's input and output spaces by leveraging an expectation-maximization procedure for latent implicit neural representations of data. This approach enables a simple yet effective model design that accurately captures underlying function distributions. Experimental results on molecule-related datasets demonstrate MING's superior performance and ability to generate plausible molecular samples, surpassing state-of-the-art data-space methods while offering a more streamlined architecture and significantly faster generation times.

| **[Conformal Generative Modeling with Improved Sample Efficiency through Sequential Greedy Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01660v2)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models lack rigorous statistical guarantees for their outputs and are therefore unreliable in safety-critical applications. In this work, we propose Sequential Conformal Prediction for Generative Models (SCOPE-Gen), a sequential conformal prediction method producing prediction sets that satisfy a rigorous statistical guarantee called conformal admissibility control. This guarantee states that with high probability, the prediction sets contain at least one admissible (or valid) example. To this end, our method first samples an initial set of i.i.d. examples from a black box generative model. Then, this set is iteratively pruned via so-called greedy filters. As a consequence of the iterative generation procedure, admissibility of the final prediction set factorizes as a Markov chain. This factorization is crucial, because it allows to control each factor separately, using conformal prediction. In comparison to prior work, our method demonstrates a large reduction in the number of admissibility evaluations during calibration. This reduction is important in safety-critical applications, where these evaluations must be conducted manually by domain experts and are therefore costly and time consuming. We highlight the advantages of our method in terms of admissibility evaluations and cardinality of the prediction sets through experiments in natural language generation and molecular graph extension tasks.</p></details> |  |

Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the leading technique for high-throughput elucidation of molecular structures. However, decoding a molecular structure from its mass spectrum is exceptionally challenging, even when performed by human experts. As a result, the vast majority of acquired MS/MS spectra remain uninterpreted, thereby limiting our understanding of the underlying (bio)chemical processes. Despite decades of progress in machine learning applications for predicting molecular structures from MS/MS spectra, the development of new methods is severely hindered by the lack of standard datasets and evaluation protocols. To address this problem, we propose MassSpecGym -- the first comprehensive benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules from MS/MS data. Our benchmark comprises the largest publicly available collection of high-quality labeled MS/MS spectra and defines three MS/MS annotation challenges: de novo molecular structure generation, molecule retrieval, and spectrum simulation. It includes new evaluation metrics and a generalization-demanding data split, therefore standardizing the MS/MS annotation tasks and rendering the problem accessible to the broad machine learning community.

Equivariant denoisers are commonly used to address this, but they introduce architectural complexity and optimization challenges, including noisy gradients and convergence issues. We propose a novel approach that enforces equivariance through a symmetrized loss function, which applies a time-dependent weighted averaging operation over group actions to the model's prediction target. This ensures equivariance without explicit architectural constraints and reduces gradient variance, leading to more stable and efficient optimization. Our method uses Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the average, incurring minimal computational overhead. We provide theoretical guarantees of equivariance for the minimizer of our loss function and demonstrate its effectiveness on synthetic datasets and the molecular conformation generation task using the GEOM-QM9 dataset. Experiments show improved sample quality compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of our approach to enhance the scalability and practicality of equivariant diffusion models in generative tasks.</p></details> |  |

One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional $\textit{de novo}$ generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on $\textit{de novo}$ molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size. DiffMS code is publicly available at https://github.com/coleygroup/DiffMS.</p></details> | Preprint |

In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as an impressive class of deep generative models, sparking extensive research and leading to numerous studies on their application to molecular generative tasks. Despite the proliferation of related work, there remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this area. Particularly, due to the diversity of diffusion model formulations, molecular data modalities, and generative task types, the research landscape is challenging to navigate, hindering understanding and limiting the area's growth. To address this, this paper conducts a comprehensive survey of diffusion model-based molecular generative methods. We systematically review the research from the perspectives of methodological formulations, data modalities, and task types, offering a novel taxonomy.

| **[Enhancing Diffusion Models Efficiency by Disentangling Total-Variance and Signal-to-Noise Ratio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08598v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long sampling time of diffusion models remains a significant bottleneck, which can be mitigated by reducing the number of diffusion time steps. However, the quality of samples with fewer steps is highly dependent on the noise schedule, i.e., the specific manner in which noise is introduced and the signal is reduced at each step. Although prior work has improved upon the original variance-preserving and variance-exploding schedules, these approaches $\textit{passively}$ adjust the total variance, without direct control over it. In this work, we propose a novel total-variance/signal-to-noise-ratio disentangled (TV/SNR) framework, where TV and SNR can be controlled independently. Our approach reveals that different existing schedules, where the TV explodes exponentially, can be $\textit{improved}$ by setting a constant TV schedule while preserving the same SNR schedule. Furthermore, generalizing the SNR schedule of the optimal transport flow matching significantly improves the performance in molecular structure generation, achieving few step generation of stable molecules. A similar tendency is observed in image generation, where our approach with a uniform diffusion time grid performs comparably to the highly tailored EDM sampler.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Representation Condition Improves Equivariant Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03655v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in molecular generative models have demonstrated substantial potential in accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often face challenges in generating high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to enhance the performance of molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the molecule generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared to directly generating a molecule, the relatively easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second-stage generation to reach a high-quality molecule in a more goal-oriented and much faster way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as the base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation tasks on the widely-used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 31\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations over conditioning on individual property values as in previous approaches. Furthermore, we show that, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly accelerating the generation process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation of Molecules via Algebraic Data Types : Advancing Beyond SMILES & SELFIES](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13633v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel molecular representation through Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) - composite data structures formed through the combination of simpler types that obey algebraic laws. By explicitly considering how the datatype of a representation constrains the operations which may be performed, we ensure meaningful inference can be performed over generative models (programs with sample} and score operations). This stands in contrast to string-based representations where string-type operations may only indirectly correspond to chemical and physical molecular properties, and at worst produce nonsensical output. The ADT presented implements the Dietz representation for molecular constitution via multigraphs and bonding systems, and uses atomic coordinate data to represent 3D information and stereochemical features. This creates a general digital molecular representation which surpasses the limitations of the string-based representations and the 2D-graph based models on which they are based. In addition, we present novel support for quantum information through representation of shells, subshells, and orbitals, greatly expanding the representational scope beyond current approaches, for instance in Molecular Orbital theory. The framework's capabilities are demonstrated through key applications: Bayesian probabilistic programming is demonstrated through integration with LazyPPL, a lazy probabilistic programming library; molecules are made instances of a group under rotation, necessary for geometric learning techniques which exploit the invariance of molecular properties under different representations; and the framework's flexibility is demonstrated through an extension to model chemical reactions.

The representational similarity between substructure pairs determines the functional compatibility of molecular binding sites. Nevertheless, aligning substructure representations by attention mechanisms lacks guidance from chemical knowledge, resulting in unstable model performance in chemical space (\textit{e.g.}, functional group, scaffold) shifted data. With theoretical justification, we propose the \textbf{Re}presentational \textbf{Align}ment with Chemical Induced \textbf{Fit} (ReAlignFit) to enhance the stability of MRL. ReAlignFit dynamically aligns substructure representation in MRL by introducing chemical Induced Fit-based inductive bias. In the induction process, we design the Bias Correction Function based on substructure edge reconstruction to align representations between substructure pairs by simulating chemical conformational changes (dynamic combination of substructures). ReAlignFit further integrates the Subgraph Information Bottleneck during fit process to refine and optimize substructure pairs exhibiting high chemical functional compatibility, leveraging them to generate molecular embeddings. Experimental results on nine datasets demonstrate that ReAlignFit outperforms state-of-the-art models in two tasks and significantly enhances model's stability in both rule-shifted and scaffold-shifted data distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOG-Diff: Higher-Order Guided Diffusion for Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04308v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph generation is a critical yet challenging task as empirical analyses require a deep understanding of complex, non-Euclidean structures. Although diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, these models typically adapt from the frameworks designed for image generation, making them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose a novel Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff) model that follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum and is guided by higher-order information, enabling the progressive generation of plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiminghh/HOG-Diff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mol-LLM: Generalist Molecular LLM with Improved Graph Utilization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02810v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have motivated the development of general LLMs for molecular tasks. While several studies have demonstrated that fine-tuned LLMs can achieve impressive benchmark performances, they are far from genuine generalist molecular LLMs due to a lack of fundamental understanding of molecular structure. Specifically, when given molecular task instructions, LLMs trained with naive next-token prediction training assign similar likelihood scores to both original and negatively corrupted molecules, revealing their lack of molecular structure understanding that is crucial for reliable and general molecular LLMs. To overcome this limitation and obtain a true generalist molecular LLM, we introduce a novel multi-modal training method based on a thorough multi-modal instruction tuning as well as a molecular structure preference optimization between chosen and rejected graphs. On various molecular benchmarks, the proposed generalist molecular LLM, called Mol-LLM, achieves state-of-the-art performances among generalist LLMs on most tasks, at the same time, surpassing or comparable to state-of-the-art specialist LLMs. Moreover, Mol-LLM also shows superior generalization performances in reaction prediction tasks, demonstrating the effect of the molecular structure understanding for generalization perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling on Lie Groups via Euclidean Generalized Score Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02513v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We extend Euclidean score-based diffusion processes to generative modeling on Lie groups. Through the formalism of Generalized Score Matching, our approach yields a Langevin dynamics which decomposes as a direct sum of Lie algebra representations, enabling generative processes on Lie groups while operating in Euclidean space. Unlike equivariant models, which restrict the space of learnable functions by quotienting out group orbits, our method can model any target distribution on any (non-Abelian) Lie group. Standard score matching emerges as a special case of our framework when the Lie group is the translation group. We prove that our generalized generative processes arise as solutions to a new class of paired stochastic differential equations (SDEs), introduced here for the first time. We validate our approach through experiments on diverse data types, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications such as SO(3)-guided molecular conformer generation and modeling ligand-specific global SE(3) transformations for molecular docking, showing improvement in comparison to Riemannian diffusion on the group itself. We show that an appropriate choice of Lie group enhances learning efficiency by reducing the effective dimensionality of the trajectory space and enables the modeling of transitions between complex data distributions. Additionally, we demonstrate the universality of our approach by deriving how it extends to flow matching.</p></details> | 27 pages |
| **[Flatten Graphs as Sequences: Transformers are Scalable Graph Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02216v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AutoGraph, a novel autoregressive framework for generating large attributed graphs using decoder-only transformers. At the core of our approach is a reversible "flattening" process that transforms graphs into random sequences. By sampling and learning from these sequences, AutoGraph enables transformers to model and generate complex graph structures in a manner akin to natural language. In contrast to diffusion models that rely on computationally intensive node features, our approach operates exclusively on these sequences. The sampling complexity and sequence length scale linearly with the number of edges, making AutoGraph highly scalable for generating large sparse graphs. Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse synthetic and molecular graph generation benchmarks, while delivering a 100-fold generation and a 3-fold training speedup compared to leading diffusion models. Additionally, it demonstrates promising transfer capabilities and supports substructure-conditioned generation without additional fine-tuning. By extending language modeling techniques to graph generation, this work paves the way for developing graph foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Docking-Aware Attention: Dynamic Protein Representations through Molecular Context Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01461v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational prediction of enzymatic reactions represents a crucial challenge in sustainable chemical synthesis across various scientific domains, ranging from drug discovery to materials science and green chemistry. These syntheses rely on proteins that selectively catalyze complex molecular transformations. These protein catalysts exhibit remarkable substrate adaptability, with the same protein often catalyzing different chemical transformations depending on its molecular partners. Current approaches to protein representation in reaction prediction either ignore protein structure entirely or rely on static embeddings, failing to capture how proteins dynamically adapt their behavior to different substrates. We present Docking-Aware Attention (DAA), a novel architecture that generates dynamic, context-dependent protein representations by incorporating molecular docking information into the attention mechanism. DAA combines physical interaction scores from docking predictions with learned attention patterns to focus on protein regions most relevant to specific molecular interactions. We evaluate our method on enzymatic reaction prediction, where it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 62.2\% accuracy versus 56.79\% on complex molecules and 55.54\% versus 49.45\% on innovative reactions. Through detailed ablation studies and visualizations, we demonstrate how DAA generates interpretable attention patterns that adapt to different molecular contexts. Our approach represents a general framework for context-aware protein representation in biocatalysis prediction, with potential applications across enzymatic synthesis planning. We open-source our implementation and pre-trained models to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable Boltzmann Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14426v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of equilibrium samples of molecular systems has been a long-standing problem in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators are a generative machine learning method that addresses this issue by learning a transformation via a normalizing flow from a simple prior distribution to the target Boltzmann distribution of interest. Recently, flow matching has been employed to train Boltzmann Generators for small molecular systems in Cartesian coordinates. We extend this work and propose a first framework for Boltzmann Generators that are transferable across chemical space, such that they predict zero-shot Boltzmann distributions for test molecules without being retrained for these systems. These transferable Boltzmann Generators allow approximate sampling from the target distribution of unseen systems, as well as efficient reweighting to the target Boltzmann distribution. The transferability of the proposed framework is evaluated on dipeptides, where we show that it generalizes efficiently to unseen systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed architecture enhances the efficiency of Boltzmann Generators trained on single molecular systems.</p></details> |  |

Here we introduce the QMe14S dataset, comprising 186,102 small organic molecules featuring 14 elements (H, B, C, N, O, F, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, As, Se, Br) and 47 functional groups. Using density functional theory at the B3LYP/TZVP level, we optimized the geometries and calculated properties including energy, atomic charge, atomic force, dipole moment, quadrupole moment, polarizability, octupole moment, first hyperpolarizability, and Hessian. At the same level, we obtained the harmonic IR, Raman and NMR spectra. Furthermore, we conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to generate dynamic configurations and extract nonequilibrium properties, including energy, forces, and Hessians. By leveraging our E(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network (DetaNet), we demonstrated that models trained on QMe14S outperform those trained on the previously developed QM9S dataset in simulating molecular spectra. The QMe14S dataset thus serves as a comprehensive benchmark for molecular simulations, offering valuable insights into structure-property relationships.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4figures |

Despite their strong predictive capabilities, these models lack a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty, which is key in scientific applications such as PDE solving, molecular generation and Machine Learning Force Fields. To address this shortcoming we present BARNN: a variational Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network. BARNNs aim to provide a principled way to turn any autoregressive or recurrent model into its Bayesian version. BARNN is based on the variational dropout method, allowing to apply it to large recurrent neural networks as well. We also introduce a temporal version of the "Variational Mixtures of Posteriors" prior (tVAMP-prior) to make Bayesian inference efficient and well-calibrated. Extensive experiments on PDE modelling and molecular generation demonstrate that BARNN not only achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, but also excels in uncertainty quantification and modelling long-range dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Chemical Design and Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21422v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced computational chemistry research in various tasks. However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for chemicals. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Discrete Denoising Diffusion Model for Molecular Generation with OpenFL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12523v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating unique molecules with biochemically desired properties to serve as viable drug candidates is a difficult task that requires specialized domain expertise. In recent years, diffusion models have shown promising results in accelerating the drug design process through AI-driven molecular generation. However, training these models requires massive amounts of data, which are often isolated in proprietary silos. OpenFL is a federated learning framework that enables privacy-preserving collaborative training across these decentralized data sites. In this work, we present a federated discrete denoising diffusion model that was trained using OpenFL. The federated model achieves comparable performance with a model trained on centralized data when evaluating the uniqueness and validity of the generated molecules. This demonstrates the utility of federated learning in the drug design process. OpenFL is available at: https://github.com/securefederatedai/openfl</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Learning to generate feasible graphs using graph grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06003v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative methods for graphs need to be sufficiently flexible to model complex dependencies between sets of nodes. At the same time, the generated graphs need to satisfy domain-dependent feasibility conditions, that is, they should not violate certain constraints that would make their interpretation impossible within the given application domain (e.g. a molecular graph where an atom has a very large number of chemical bounds). Crucially, constraints can involve not only local but also long-range dependencies: for example, the maximal length of a cycle can be bounded. Currently, a large class of generative approaches for graphs, such as methods based on artificial neural networks, is based on message passing schemes. These approaches suffer from information 'dilution' issues that severely limit the maximal range of the dependencies that can be modeled. To address this problem, we propose a generative approach based on the notion of graph grammars. The key novel idea is to introduce a domain-dependent coarsening procedure to provide short-cuts for long-range dependencies. We show the effectiveness of our proposal in two domains: 1) small drugs and 2) RNA secondary structures. In the first case, we compare the quality of the generated molecular graphs via the Molecular Sets (MOSES) benchmark suite, which evaluates the distance between generated and real molecules, their lipophilicity, synthesizability, and drug-likeness. In the second case, we show that the approach can generate very large graphs (with hundreds of nodes) that are accepted as valid examples for a desired RNA family by the "Infernal" covariance model, a state-of-the-art RNA classifier.

MOFA addresses key challenges in integrating GPU-accelerated computing for GPU-intensive GenAI tasks, including distributed training and inference, alongside CPU- and GPU-optimized tasks for screening and filtering AI-generated MOFs using molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and Monte Carlo simulations. These heterogeneous tasks are unified within an online learning framework that optimizes the utilization of available CPU and GPU resources across HPC systems. Performance metrics from a 450-node (14,400 AMD Zen 3 CPUs + 1800 NVIDIA A100 GPUs) supercomputer run demonstrate that MOFA achieves high-throughput generation of novel MOF structures, with CO$_2$ adsorption capacities ranking among the top 10 in the hypothetical MOF (hMOF) dataset. Furthermore, the production of high-quality MOFs exhibits a linear relationship with the number of nodes utilized. The modular architecture of MOFA will facilitate its integration into other scientific applications that dynamically combine GenAI with large-scale simulations.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Molecular Graph Contrastive Learning with Line Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08589v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trapped by the label scarcity in molecular property prediction and drug design, graph contrastive learning (GCL) came forward. Leading contrastive learning works show two kinds of view generators, that is, random or learnable data corruption and domain knowledge incorporation. While effective, the two ways also lead to molecular semantics altering and limited generalization capability, respectively. To this end, we relate the \textbf{L}in\textbf{E} graph with \textbf{MO}lecular graph co\textbf{N}trastive learning and propose a novel method termed \textit{LEMON}. Specifically, by contrasting the given graph with the corresponding line graph, the graph encoder can freely encode the molecular semantics without omission. Furthermore, we present a new patch with edge attribute fusion and two local contrastive losses enhance information transmission and tackle hard negative samples. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for view generation, superior performance on molecular property prediction suggests the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based 3D molecule generation with neural fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08508v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new representation for 3D molecules based on their continuous atomic density fields. Using this representation, we propose a new model based on walk-jump sampling for unconditional 3D molecule generation in the continuous space using neural fields. Our model, FuncMol, encodes molecular fields into latent codes using a conditional neural field, samples noisy codes from a Gaussian-smoothed distribution with Langevin MCMC (walk), denoises these samples in a single step (jump), and finally decodes them into molecular fields. FuncMol performs all-atom generation of 3D molecules without assumptions on the molecular structure and scales well with the size of molecules, unlike most approaches. Our method achieves competitive results on drug-like molecules and easily scales to macro-cyclic peptides, with at least one order of magnitude faster sampling.

| **[GDiffRetro: Retrosynthesis Prediction with Dual Graph Enhanced Molecular Representation and Diffusion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08001v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrosynthesis prediction focuses on identifying reactants capable of synthesizing a target product. Typically, the retrosynthesis prediction involves two phases: Reaction Center Identification and Reactant Generation. However, we argue that most existing methods suffer from two limitations in the two phases: (i) Existing models do not adequately capture the ``face'' information in molecular graphs for the reaction center identification. (ii) Current approaches for the reactant generation predominantly use sequence generation in a 2D space, which lacks versatility in generating reasonable distributions for completed reactive groups and overlooks molecules' inherent 3D properties. To overcome the above limitations, we propose GDiffRetro. For the reaction center identification, GDiffRetro uniquely integrates the original graph with its corresponding dual graph to represent molecular structures, which helps guide the model to focus more on the faces in the graph. For the reactant generation, GDiffRetro employs a conditional diffusion model in 3D to further transform the obtained synthon into a complete reactant. Our experimental findings reveal that GDiffRetro outperforms state-of-the-art semi-template models across various evaluative metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[D3MES: Diffusion Transformer with multihead equivariant self-attention for 3D molecule generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07077v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting the diverse conformational states of molecules is crucial for advancing fields such as chemistry, material science, and drug development. Despite significant progress in generative models, accurately generating complex and biologically or material-relevant molecular structures remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model for three-dimensional (3D) molecule generation that combines a classifiable diffusion model, Diffusion Transformer, with multihead equivariant self-attention. This method addresses two key challenges: correctly attaching hydrogen atoms in generated molecules through learning representations of molecules after hydrogen atoms are removed; and overcoming the limitations of existing models that cannot generate molecules across multiple classes simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that our model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across several key metrics but also exhibits robustness and versatility, making it highly suitable for early-stage large-scale generation processes in molecular design, followed by validation and further screening to obtain molecules with specific properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenMol: A Drug Discovery Generalist with Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06158v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is a complex process that involves multiple scenarios and stages, such as fragment-constrained molecule generation, hit generation and lead optimization. However, existing molecular generative models can only tackle one or two of these scenarios and lack the flexibility to address various aspects of the drug discovery pipeline. In this paper, we present Generalist Molecular generative model (GenMol), a versatile framework that addresses these limitations by applying discrete diffusion to the Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) molecular representation. GenMol generates SAFE sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering and enhanced computational efficiency. Moreover, under the discrete diffusion framework, we introduce fragment remasking, a strategy that optimizes molecules by replacing fragments with masked tokens and regenerating them, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model trained on SAFE representations in de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization. These experimental results demonstrate that GenMol can tackle a wide range of drug discovery tasks, providing a unified and versatile approach for molecular design.</p></details> |  |

Recently developed deep learning methods, particularly diffusion models have reached competitive performance over traditional cheminformatical approaches. However, these methods are often time-consuming or require extra support from traditional methods. We propose EquiBoost, a boosting model that stacks several equivariant graph transformers as weak learners, to iteratively refine 3D conformations of molecules. Without relying on diffusion techniques, EquiBoost balances accuracy and efficiency more effectively than diffusion-based methods. Notably, compared to the previous state-of-the-art diffusion method, EquiBoost improves generation quality and preserves diversity, achieving considerably better precision of Average Minimum RMSD (AMR) on the GEOM datasets. This work rejuvenates boosting and sheds light on its potential to be a robust alternative to diffusion models in certain scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Molecule Generation Using Latent Space Graph Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03696v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating molecular graphs is a challenging task due to their discrete nature and the competitive objectives involved. Diffusion models have emerged as SOTA approaches in data generation across various modalities. For molecular graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) as a diffusion backbone have achieved impressive results. Latent space diffusion, where diffusion occurs in a low-dimensional space via an autoencoder, has demonstrated computational efficiency. However, the literature on latent space diffusion for molecular graphs is scarce, and no commonly accepted best practices exist. In this work, we explore different approaches and hyperparameters, contrasting generative flow models (denoising diffusion, flow matching, heat dissipation) and architectures (GNNs and E(3)-equivariant GNNs). Our experiments reveal a high sensitivity to the choice of approach and design decisions.

| **[Navigating Chemical-Linguistic Sharing Space with Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20888v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical language models (CLMs) are prominent for their effectiveness in exploring chemical space and enabling molecular engineering. However, while exploring chemical-linguistic space, CLMs suffer from the gap between natural language and molecular representations. This challenge is primarily due to the inherent modeling differences between molecules and texts: molecules operate unified modeling to learn chemical space, while natural language sequentially models the semantic space. Additionally, the limited availability of high-quality text-to-molecule datasets further exacerbates this challenge. To address the problem, we first verified the information bias in molecular representations from different perspectives. We then developed the Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding (HME) framework, a unified molecular encoder compressing the molecular features from fragment sequence, topology, and conformation with Q-learning. To better model chemical-linguistic space, we further constructed the MCMoD dataset, which contains over one million molecules with various conditions, including properties, fragments, and descriptions. Experimentally, HME promotes CLMs to achieve chemical-linguistic sharing space exploration: (1) chemical space exploration with linguistic guidance, where HME achieves significant improvements (+8.9\% FCD) for molecular design in multiple constraints, even in zero-shot scenarios; (2) linguistic space exploration with molecular guidance, where HME generates textual descriptions with high qualities (+11.6\% BLEU) for molecules. These results highlight the precision of HME in handling multi-objective and cross-domain tasks, as well as its remarkable generalization capability on unseen task combinations. HME offers a new perspective on navigating chemical-linguistic sharing space, advancing the potential of CLMs in both fundamental research and practical applications in chemistry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

We find that a key limitation is not in the molecule generation process itself, but in the poor generalization capabilities of molecular property predictors. We tackle this challenge by creating an active-learning, closed-loop molecule generation pipeline, whereby molecular generative models are iteratively refined on feedback from quantum chemical simulations to improve generalization to new chemical space. Compared against other generative model approaches, only our active learning approach generates molecules with properties that extrapolate beyond the training data (reaching up to 0.44 standard deviations beyond the training data range) and out-of-distribution molecule classification accuracy is improved by 79%. By conditioning molecular generation on thermodynamic stability data from the active-learning loop, the proportion of stable molecules generated is 3.5x higher than the next-best model.</p></details> |  |

Dissipativity is a crucial indicator for dynamical systems that generalizes stability and input-output stability, known to be valid across various systems including robotics, biological systems, and molecular dynamics. By analytically proving the general solution to the nonlinear Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for dissipativity, we propose a differentiable projection that transforms any dynamics represented by neural networks into dissipative ones and a learning method for the transformed dynamics. Utilizing the generality of dissipativity, our method strictly guarantee stability, input-output stability, and energy conservation of trained dynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method against out-of-domain input through applications to robotic arms and fluid dynamics.

However, in molecular science, CMs are less common than black-box models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), due to their need for predefined concepts and manual labeling. This paper introduces the Automated Molecular Concept (AutoMolCo) framework, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate and label predictive molecular concepts. Through iterative concept refinement, AutoMolCo enables simple linear models to outperform GNNs and LLM in-context learning on several benchmarks. The framework operates without human knowledge input, overcoming limitations of existing CMs while maintaining explainability and allowing easy intervention. Experiments on MoleculeNet and High-Throughput Experimentation (HTE) datasets demonstrate that AutoMolCo-induced explainable CMs are beneficial for molecular science research.</p></details> |  |

More recently, these workflows have been significantly augmented with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and systems of autonomous agents capable of utilizing pre-trained models to make predictions in the context of more complex research tasks. While effective, there is still room for substantial improvement within agentic systems on the retrieval of salient information for material design tasks. Within this context, alternative uses of predictive deep learning models, such as leveraging their latent representations to facilitate cross-modal retrieval augmented generation within agentic systems for task-specific materials design, has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained chemistry foundation models can serve as a basis for enabling structure-focused, semantic chemistry information retrieval for both small-molecules, complex polymeric materials, and reactions. Additionally, we show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with multi-modal models such as OpenCLIP facilitate unprecedented queries and information retrieval across multiple characterization data domains. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of these models within multi-agent systems to facilitate structure and topological-based natural language queries and information retrieval for different research tasks.</p></details> |  |

Here we hypothesized that ORs can be viewed as 3D spatial filters that extract molecular features relevant to the olfactory system, similarly to the spatio-temporal filters found in other sensory modalities. To build these filters, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict human olfactory percepts obtained from several semantic datasets. Our neural network, the DeepNose, produced responses that are approximately invariant to the molecules' orientation, due to its equivariant architecture. Our network offers high-fidelity perceptual predictions for different olfactory datasets. In addition, our approach allows us to identify molecular features that contribute to specific perceptual descriptors. Because the DeepNose network is designed to be aligned with the biological system, our approach predicts distinct perceptual qualities for different stereoisomers. The architecture of the DeepNose relying on the processing of several molecules at the same time permits inferring the perceptual quality of odor mixtures. We propose that the DeepNose network can use 3D molecular shapes to generate high-quality predictions for human olfactory percepts and help identify molecular features responsible for odor quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, to be appear in the proceedings of Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (ACSSC 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Chimera: Accurate retrosynthesis prediction by ensembling models with diverse inductive biases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05269v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning and conducting chemical syntheses remains a major bottleneck in the discovery of functional small molecules, and prevents fully leveraging generative AI for molecular inverse design. While early work has shown that ML-based retrosynthesis models can predict reasonable routes, their low accuracy for less frequent, yet important reactions has been pointed out. As multi-step search algorithms are limited to reactions suggested by the underlying model, the applicability of those tools is inherently constrained by the accuracy of retrosynthesis prediction. Inspired by how chemists use different strategies to ideate reactions, we propose Chimera: a framework for building highly accurate reaction models that combine predictions from diverse sources with complementary inductive biases using a learning-based ensembling strategy. We instantiate the framework with two newly developed models, which already by themselves achieve state of the art in their categories. Through experiments across several orders of magnitude in data scale and time-splits, we show Chimera outperforms all major models by a large margin, owing both to the good individual performance of its constituents, but also to the scalability of our ensembling strategy. Moreover, we find that PhD-level organic chemists prefer predictions from Chimera over baselines in terms of quality. Finally, we transfer the largest-scale checkpoint to an internal dataset from a major pharmaceutical company, showing robust generalization under distribution shift. With the new dimension that our framework unlocks, we anticipate further acceleration in the development of even more accurate models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMDM:Latent Molecular Diffusion Model For 3D Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04242v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>n this work, we propose a latent molecular diffusion model that can make the generated 3D molecules rich in diversity and maintain rich geometric features. The model captures the information of the forces and local constraints between atoms so that the generated molecules can maintain Euclidean transformation and high level of effectiveness and diversity. We also use the lowerrank manifold advantage of the latent variables of the latent model to fuse the information of the forces between atoms to better maintain the geometric equivariant properties of the molecules. Because there is no need to perform information fusion encoding in stages like traditional encoders and decoders, this reduces the amount of calculation in the back-propagation process. The model keeps the forces and local constraints of particle bonds in the latent variable space, reducing the impact of underfitting on the surface of the network on the large position drift of the particle geometry, so that our model can converge earlier. We introduce a distribution control variable in each backward step to strengthen exploration and improve the diversity of generation. In the experiment, the quality of the samples we generated and the convergence speed of the model have been significantly improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.05710 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Tokenizing 3D Molecule Structure with Quantized Spherical Coordinates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01564v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of language models (LMs) to molecular structure generation using line notations such as SMILES and SELFIES has been well-established in the field of cheminformatics. However, extending these models to generate 3D molecular structures presents significant challenges. Two primary obstacles emerge: (1) the difficulty in designing a 3D line notation that ensures SE(3)-invariant atomic coordinates, and (2) the non-trivial task of tokenizing continuous coordinates for use in LMs, which inherently require discrete inputs. To address these challenges, we propose Mol-StrucTok, a novel method for tokenizing 3D molecular structures. Our approach comprises two key innovations: (1) We design a line notation for 3D molecules by extracting local atomic coordinates in a spherical coordinate system. This notation builds upon existing 2D line notations and remains agnostic to their specific forms, ensuring compatibility with various molecular representation schemes. (2) We employ a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to tokenize these coordinates, treating them as generation descriptors. To further enhance the representation, we incorporate neighborhood bond lengths and bond angles as understanding descriptors. Leveraging this tokenization framework, we train a GPT-2 style model for 3D molecular generation tasks. Results demonstrate strong performance with significantly faster generation speeds and competitive chemical stability compared to previous methods. Further, by integrating our learned discrete representations into Graphormer model for property prediction on QM9 dataset, Mol-StrucTok reveals consistent improvements across various molecular properties, underscoring the versatility and robustness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, preprint</p></details> |

While traditional methods for designing new ionizable lipids are typically time-consuming, deep generative models have emerged as a powerful solution, significantly accelerating the molecular discovery process. However, a practical challenge arises as the molecular structures generated can often be difficult or infeasible to synthesize. This project explores Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)-based generative models for synthesizable ionizable lipids. Leveraging a synthetically accessible lipid building block dataset and two specialized predictors to guide the search through chemical space, we introduce a policy network guided MCTS generative model capable of producing new ionizable lipids with available synthesis pathways.</p></details> |  |
| **[Riemannian Denoising Score Matching for Molecular Structure Optimization with Accurate Energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19769v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a modified score matching method aimed at generating molecular structures with high energy accuracy. The denoising process of score matching or diffusion models mirrors molecular structure optimization, where scores act like physical force fields that guide particles toward equilibrium states. To achieve energetically accurate structures, it can be advantageous to have the score closely approximate the gradient of the actual potential energy surface. Unlike conventional methods that simply design the target score based on structural differences in Euclidean space, we propose a Riemannian score matching approach. This method represents molecular structures on a manifold defined by physics-informed internal coordinates to efficiently mimic the energy landscape, and performs noising and denoising within this space. Our method has been evaluated by refining several types of starting structures on the QM9 and GEOM datasets, demonstrating that the proposed Riemannian score matching method significantly improves the accuracy of the generated molecular structures, attaining chemical accuracy. The implications of this study extend to various applications in computational chemistry, offering a robust tool for accurate molecular structure prediction.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we add high quality PyTorch [Paszke et al., 2019] implementations of the Molecular Generative Adversarial Networks (MolGAN) [Cao and Kipf, 2022] and Normalizing Flows [Papamakarios et al., 2021].

| **[Balancing Molecular Information and Empirical Data in the Prediction of Physico-Chemical Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08075v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the physico-chemical properties of pure substances and mixtures is a central task in thermodynamics. Established prediction methods range from fully physics-based ab-initio calculations, which are only feasible for very simple systems, over descriptor-based methods that use some information on the molecules to be modeled together with fitted model parameters (e.g., quantitative-structure-property relationship methods or classical group contribution methods), to representation-learning methods, which may, in extreme cases, completely ignore molecular descriptors and extrapolate only from existing data on the property to be modeled (e.g., matrix completion methods). In this work, we propose a general method for combining molecular descriptors with representation learning using the so-called expectation maximization algorithm from the probabilistic machine learning literature, which uses uncertainty estimates to trade off between the two approaches. The proposed hybrid model exploits chemical structure information using graph neural networks, but it automatically detects cases where structure-based predictions are unreliable, in which case it corrects them by representation-learning based predictions that can better specialize to unusual cases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the prediction of activity coefficients in binary mixtures as an example. The results are compelling, as the method significantly improves predictive accuracy over the current state of the art, showcasing its potential to advance the prediction of physico-chemical properties in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, including 11 pages of main text and 3 pages of appendix, added analysis of improvements in predictive accuracy, added Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Discrete Flow Matching for 3D De Novo Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16644v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models that produce novel molecular structures have the potential to facilitate chemical discovery. Flow matching is a recently proposed generative modeling framework that has achieved impressive performance on a variety of tasks including those on biomolecular structures. The seminal flow matching framework was developed only for continuous data. However, de novo molecular design tasks require generating discrete data such as atomic elements or sequences of amino acid residues. Several discrete flow matching methods have been proposed recently to address this gap. In this work we benchmark the performance of existing discrete flow matching methods for 3D de novo small molecule generation and provide explanations of their differing behavior. As a result we present FlowMol-CTMC, an open-source model that achieves state of the art performance for 3D de novo design with fewer learnable parameters than existing methods. Additionally, we propose the use of metrics that capture molecule quality beyond local chemical valency constraints and towards higher-order structural motifs. These metrics show that even though basic constraints are satisfied, the models tend to produce unusual and potentially problematic functional groups outside of the training data distribution. Code and trained models for reproducing this work are available at \url{https://github.com/dunni3/FlowMol}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the NeurIPS 2024 Machine Learning for Structural Biology Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Limeade: Let integer molecular encoding aid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16623v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is a well-established framework for computer-aided molecular design (CAMD). By precisely encoding the molecular space and score functions, e.g., a graph neural network, the molecular design problem is represented and solved as an optimization problem, the solution of which corresponds to a molecule with optimal score. However, both the extremely large search space and complicated scoring process limit the use of MIP-based CAMD to specific and tiny problems. Moreover, optimal molecule may not be meaningful in practice if scores are imperfect. Instead of pursuing optimality, this paper exploits the ability of MIP in molecular generation and proposes Limeade as an end-to-end tool from real-world needs to feasible molecules. Beyond the basic constraints for structural feasibility, Limeade supports inclusion and exclusion of SMARTS patterns, automating the process of interpreting and formulating chemical requirements to mathematical constraints.</p></details> | 32 pages, 2 figures |
| **[MolMetaLM: a Physicochemical Knowledge-Guided Molecular Meta Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15500v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most current molecular language models transfer the masked language model or image-text generation model from natural language processing to molecular field. However, molecules are not solely characterized by atom/bond symbols; they encapsulate important physical/chemical properties. Moreover, normal language models bring grammar rules that are irrelevant for understanding molecules. In this study, we propose a novel physicochemical knowledge-guided molecular meta language framework MolMetaLM. We design a molecule-specialized meta language paradigm, formatted as multiple <S,P,O> (subject, predicate, object) knowledge triples sharing the same S (i.e., molecule) to enhance learning the semantic relationships between physicochemical knowledge and molecules. By introducing different molecular knowledge and noises, the meta language paradigm generates tens of thousands of pretraining tasks. By recovering the token/sequence/order-level noises, MolMetaLM exhibits proficiency in large-scale benchmark evaluations involving property prediction, molecule generation, conformation inference, and molecular optimization. Through MolMetaLM, we offer a new insight for designing language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Practical and Asymptotically Exact Conditional Sampling in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17775v2)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been successful on a range of conditional generation tasks including molecular design and text-to-image generation. However, these achievements have primarily depended on task-specific conditional training or error-prone heuristic approximations. Ideally, a conditional generation method should provide exact samples for a broad range of conditional distributions without requiring task-specific training. To this end, we introduce the Twisted Diffusion Sampler, or TDS. TDS is a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that targets the conditional distributions of diffusion models through simulating a set of weighted particles. The main idea is to use twisting, an SMC technique that enjoys good computational efficiency, to incorporate heuristic approximations without compromising asymptotic exactness. We first find in simulation and in conditional image generation tasks that TDS provides a computational statistical trade-off, yielding more accurate approximations with many particles but with empirical improvements over heuristics with as few as two particles. We then turn to motif-scaffolding, a core task in protein design, using a TDS extension to Riemannian diffusion models. On benchmark test cases, TDS allows flexible conditioning criteria and often outperforms the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/blt2114/twisted_diffusion_sampler</p></details> |

Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods often overlook structural information. However, feature engineering-based methods usually merely focus on binding affinity prediction without substantial molecular modification. To address this, we present Graph-based Topological Reinforcement Learning (GraphTRL), which integrates both chemical and structural data for improved molecular generation. GraphTRL leverages multiscale weighted colored graphs (MWCG) and persistent homology, combined with molecular fingerprints, as the state space for RL. Evaluations show that GraphTRL outperforms existing methods in binding affinity prediction, offering a promising approach to accelerate drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolReFlect: Towards In-Context Fine-grained Alignments between Molecules and Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14721v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecule discovery is a pivotal research field, impacting everything from the medicines we take to the materials we use. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in molecule understanding and generation, yet the alignments between molecules and their corresponding captions remain a significant challenge. Previous endeavours often treat the molecule as a general SMILES string or molecular graph, neglecting the fine-grained alignments between the molecular sub-structures and the descriptive textual phrases, which are crucial for accurate and explainable predictions. In this case, we introduce MolReFlect, a novel teacher-student framework designed to contextually perform the molecule-caption alignments in a fine-grained way. Our approach initially leverages a larger teacher LLM to label the detailed alignments by directly extracting critical phrases from molecule captions or SMILES strings and implying them to corresponding sub-structures or characteristics. To refine these alignments, we propose In-Context Selective Reflection, which retrieves previous extraction results as context examples for teacher LLM to reflect and lets a smaller student LLM select from in-context reflection and previous extraction results. Finally, we enhance the learning process of the student LLM through Chain-of-Thought In-Context Molecule Tuning, integrating the fine-grained alignments and the reasoning processes within the Chain-of-Thought format. Our experimental results demonstrate that MolReFlect enables LLMs like Mistral-7B to significantly outperform the previous baselines, achieving SOTA performance on the ChEBI-20 dataset. This advancement not only enhances the generative capabilities of LLMs in the molecule-caption translation task, but also contributes to a more explainable framework.</p></details> | 22 pages, 12 figures |

Recently, ligand-based virtual screening has garnered significant attention due to its efficacy in conducting extensive database screenings without relying on specific protein-binding site information. Obtaining binding affinity data for complexes is highly expensive, resulting in a limited amount of available data that covers a relatively small chemical space. Moreover, these datasets contain a significant amount of inconsistent noise. It is challenging to identify an inductive bias that consistently maintains the integrity of molecular activity during data augmentation. To tackle these challenges, we propose S-MolSearch, the first framework to our knowledge, that leverages molecular 3D information and affinity information in semi-supervised contrastive learning for ligand-based virtual screening. Drawing on the principles of inverse optimal transport, S-MolSearch efficiently processes both labeled and unlabeled data, training molecular structural encoders while generating soft labels for the unlabeled data. This design allows S-MolSearch to adaptively utilize unlabeled data within the learning process. Empirically, S-MolSearch demonstrates superior performance on widely-used benchmarks LIT-PCBA and DUD-E. It surpasses both structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening methods for AUROC, BEDROC and EF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molecule Generation with Fragment Retrieval Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12078v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fragment-based drug discovery, in which molecular fragments are assembled into new molecules with desirable biochemical properties, has achieved great success. However, many fragment-based molecule generation methods show limited exploration beyond the existing fragments in the database as they only reassemble or slightly modify the given ones. To tackle this problem, we propose a new fragment-based molecule generation framework with retrieval augmentation, namely Fragment Retrieval-Augmented Generation (f-RAG). f-RAG is based on a pre-trained molecular generative model that proposes additional fragments from input fragments to complete and generate a new molecule. Given a fragment vocabulary, f-RAG retrieves two types of fragments: (1) hard fragments, which serve as building blocks that will be explicitly included in the newly generated molecule, and (2) soft fragments, which serve as reference to guide the generation of new fragments through a trainable fragment injection module. To extrapolate beyond the existing fragments, f-RAG updates the fragment vocabulary with generated fragments via an iterative refinement process which is further enhanced with post-hoc genetic fragment modification. f-RAG can achieve an improved exploration-exploitation trade-off by maintaining a pool of fragments and expanding it with novel and high-quality fragments through a strong generative prior.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

In this study, we introduce a neuroevolution potential (NEP), trained on a dataset generated from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, using the moment tensor potential (MTP) as a reference. The low root mean square errors (RMSEs) for total energy and atomic forces demonstrate the high accuracy and transferability of both the MTP and NEP. We further calculate the phonon density of states (DOS) and radial distribution function (RDF) using both machine learning potentials, comparing the results to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the MTP potential offers slightly higher accuracy, the NEP achieves a remarkable 41-fold increase in computational speed. These findings provide detailed microscopic insights into the dynamics and rapid Cu-ion diffusion, paving the way for future studies on Cu-based solid electrolytes and their applications in energy devices.</p></details> |  |

For decades following the creation of MD, simulations have improved with computing power along the three principal dimensions of accuracy, atom count (spatial scale), and duration (temporal scale). Since the mid-2000s, computer platforms have however failed to provide strong scaling for MD as scale-out CPU and GPU platforms that provide substantial increases to spatial scale do not lead to proportional increases in temporal scale. Important scientific problems therefore remained inaccessible to direct simulation, prompting the development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms that present significant complexity, accuracy, and efficiency challenges. While bespoke MD-only hardware solutions have provided a path to longer timescales for specific physical systems, their impact on the broader community has been mitigated by their limited adaptability to new methods and potentials. In this work, we show that a novel computing architecture, the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine, completely alters the scaling path by delivering unprecedentedly high simulation rates up to 1.144M steps/second for 200,000 atoms whose interactions are described by an Embedded Atom Method potential. This enables direct simulations of the evolution of materials using general-purpose programmable hardware over millisecond timescales, dramatically increasing the space of direct MD simulations that can be carried out.</p></details> |  |

Despite the popularity of probabilistic generative models, numerical experiments benchmarking their performance on molecular data are lacking. In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: Neural Spline Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) Neural Spline Flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) Conditional Flow Matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models appears the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib\textsubscript{9} peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope our taxonomy of probabilistic generative frameworks and numerical results may guide model selection for a wide range of molecular tasks.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, it does not extract key substructures from a single patient visit, resulting in the failure to identify medication molecules suitable for the current patient visit. To address the above limitations, we propose a bimodal molecular recommendation framework named BiMoRec, which introduces 3D molecular structures to obtain atomic 3D coordinates and edge indices, overcoming the inherent lack of high-dimensional molecular information in 2D molecular structures. To retain the fast training and prediction efficiency of the recommendation system, we use bimodal graph contrastive pretraining to maximize the mutual information between the two molecular modalities, achieving the fusion of 2D and 3D molecular graphs. Additionally, we designed a molecular multi-step enhancement mechanism to re-calibrate the molecular weights. Specifically, we employ a pre-training method that captures both 2D and 3D molecular structure representations, along with substructure representations, and leverages contrastive learning to extract mutual information. We then use the pre-trained encoder to generate molecular representations, enhancing them through a three-step process: intra-visit, molecular per-visit, and latest-visit. Finally, we apply temporal information aggregation to generate the final medication combinations. Our implementation on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

These models have been developed inheriting from the advances in natural language processing and computer vision, achieving ever greater results. However, generative molecular modelling has unique challenges that are often overlooked. Chemical validity, interpretability of the generation process and flexibility to variable molecular sizes are among some of the remaining challenges for generative models in computational materials design. In this work, we propose an autoregressive approach that decomposes molecular generation into a sequence of discrete and interpretable steps using molecular fragments as units, a 'molecular story'. Enforcing chemical rules in the stories guarantees the chemical validity of the generated molecules, the discrete sequential steps of a molecular story makes the process transparent improving interpretability, and the autoregressive nature of the approach allows the size of the molecule to be a decision of the model. We demonstrate the validity of the approach in a multi-target inverse design of electroactive organic compounds, focusing on the target properties of solubility, redox potential, and synthetic accessibility. Our results show that the model can effectively bias the generation distribution according to the prompted multi-target objective.</p></details> |  |

However, the molecular generation process with diffusion models involves multiple autoregressive steps over a finite time horizon, leading to exposure bias issues inherently. To address the exposure bias issue, we propose a training framework named GapDiff. The core idea of GapDiff is to utilize model-predicted conformations as ground truth probabilistically during training, aiming to mitigate the data distributional disparity between training and inference, thereby enhancing the affinity of generated molecules. We conduct experiments using a 3D molecular generation model on the CrossDocked2020 dataset, and the vina energy and diversity demonstrate the potency of our framework with superior affinity.

However, most existing machine learning methods for small molecule generation suffer from poor synthesizability of candidate compounds, making experimental validation difficult. In this paper we propose Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), an extension of the GFlowNet framework that operates directly in the space of chemical reactions, thereby allowing out-of-the-box synthesizability while maintaining comparable quality of generated candidates. We demonstrate that with the proposed set of reactions and building blocks, it is possible to obtain a search space of molecules orders of magnitude larger than existing screening libraries coupled with low cost of synthesis. We also show that the approach scales to very large fragment libraries, further increasing the number of potential molecules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across a range of oracle models, including pretrained proxy models and GPU-accelerated docking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Benefits of Domain-Pretraining of Generative Large Language Models for Chemistry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03542v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A proliferation of Large Language Models (the GPT series, BLOOM, LLaMA, and more) are driving forward novel development of multipurpose AI for a variety of tasks, particularly natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models demonstrate strong performance on a range of tasks; however, there has been evidence of brittleness when applied to more niche or narrow domains where hallucinations or fluent but incorrect responses reduce performance. Given the complex nature of scientific domains, it is prudent to investigate the trade-offs of leveraging off-the-shelf versus more targeted foundation models for scientific domains. In this work, we examine the benefits of in-domain pre-training for a given scientific domain, chemistry, and compare these to open-source, off-the-shelf models with zero-shot and few-shot prompting. Our results show that not only do in-domain base models perform reasonably well on in-domain tasks in a zero-shot setting but that further adaptation using instruction fine-tuning yields impressive performance on chemistry-specific tasks such as named entity recognition and molecular formula generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathway-Guided Optimization of Deep Generative Molecular Design Models for Cancer Therapy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03460v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The data-driven drug design problem can be formulated as an optimization task of a potentially expensive black-box objective function over a huge high-dimensional and structured molecular space. The junction tree variational autoencoder (JTVAE) has been shown to be an efficient generative model that can be used for suggesting legitimate novel drug-like small molecules with improved properties. While the performance of the generative molecular design (GMD) scheme strongly depends on the initial training data, one can improve its sampling efficiency for suggesting better molecules with enhanced properties by optimizing the latent space. In this work, we propose how mechanistic models - such as pathway models described by differential equations - can be used for effective latent space optimization(LSO) of JTVAEs and other similar models for GMD. To demonstrate the potential of our proposed approach, we show how a pharmacodynamic model, assessing the therapeutic efficacy of a drug-like small molecule by predicting how it modulates a cancer pathway, can be incorporated for effective LSO of data-driven models for GMD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-biased molecular dynamics for learning uniformly accurate interatomic potentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01416v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently creating a concise but comprehensive data set for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is an under-explored problem. Active learning, which uses biased or unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) to generate candidate pools, aims to address this objective. Existing biased and unbiased MD-simulation methods, however, are prone to miss either rare events or extrapolative regions -- areas of the configurational space where unreliable predictions are made. This work demonstrates that MD, when biased by the MLIP's energy uncertainty, simultaneously captures extrapolative regions and rare events, which is crucial for developing uniformly accurate MLIPs. Furthermore, exploiting automatic differentiation, we enhance bias-forces-driven MD with the concept of bias stress. We employ calibrated gradient-based uncertainties to yield MLIPs with similar or, sometimes, better accuracy than ensemble-based methods at a lower computational cost. Finally, we apply uncertainty-biased MD to alanine dipeptide and MIL-53(Al), generating MLIPs that represent both configurational spaces more accurately than models trained with conventional MD.</p></details> |  |

However, conditional molecular generation remains a fundamental challenge due to an intrinsic trade-off between targeting specific chemical properties and generating meaningful samples from the data distribution. In this work, we present Time-Aware Conditional Synthesis (TACS), a novel approach to conditional generation on diffusion models. It integrates adaptively controlled plug-and-play "online" guidance into a diffusion model, driving samples toward the desired properties while maintaining validity and stability. A key component of our algorithm is our new type of diffusion sampler, Time Correction Sampler (TCS), which is used to control guidance and ensure that the generated molecules remain on the correct manifold at each reverse step of the diffusion process at the same time. Our proposed method demonstrates significant performance in conditional 3D molecular generation and offers a promising approach towards inverse molecular design, potentially facilitating advancements in drug discovery, materials science, and other related fields.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

The advancements in LLMs and instruction tuning have led to the development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, the competency of the LLMs and instruction tuning have been less explored in the molecular domain. Thus, we propose LLaMo: Large Language Model-based Molecular graph assistant, which is an end-to-end trained large molecular graph-language model. To bridge the discrepancy between the language and graph modalities, we present the multi-level graph projector that transforms graph representations into graph tokens by abstracting the output representations of each GNN layer and motif representations with the cross-attention mechanism. We also introduce machine-generated molecular graph instruction data to instruction-tune the large molecular graph-language model for general-purpose molecule and language understanding. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaMo shows the best performance on diverse tasks, such as molecular description generation, property prediction, and IUPAC name prediction.

| **[Fisher Flow Matching for Generative Modeling over Discrete Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14664v4)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling over discrete data has recently seen numerous success stories, with applications spanning language modeling, biological sequence design, and graph-structured molecular data. The predominant generative modeling paradigm for discrete data is still autoregressive, with more recent alternatives based on diffusion or flow-matching falling short of their impressive performance in continuous data settings, such as image or video generation. In this work, we introduce Fisher-Flow, a novel flow-matching model for discrete data. Fisher-Flow takes a manifestly geometric perspective by considering categorical distributions over discrete data as points residing on a statistical manifold equipped with its natural Riemannian metric: the $\textit{Fisher-Rao metric}$. As a result, we demonstrate discrete data itself can be continuously reparameterised to points on the positive orthant of the $d$-hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^d_+$, which allows us to define flows that map any source distribution to target in a principled manner by transporting mass along (closed-form) geodesics of $\mathbb{S}^d_+$. Furthermore, the learned flows in Fisher-Flow can be further bootstrapped by leveraging Riemannian optimal transport leading to improved training dynamics. We prove that the gradient flow induced by Fisher-Flow is optimal in reducing the forward KL divergence. We evaluate Fisher-Flow on an array of synthetic and diverse real-world benchmarks, including designing DNA Promoter, and DNA Enhancer sequences. Empirically, we find that Fisher-Flow improves over prior diffusion and flow-matching models on these benchmarks.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Existing state-of-the-art approaches either resort to large scale transformer-based models that diffuse over conformer fields, or use computationally expensive methods to generate initial structures and diffuse over torsion angles. In this work, we introduce Equivariant Transformer Flow (ET-Flow). We showcase that a well-designed flow matching approach with equivariance and harmonic prior alleviates the need for complex internal geometry calculations and large architectures, contrary to the prevailing methods in the field. Our approach results in a straightforward and scalable method that directly operates on all-atom coordinates with minimal assumptions. With the advantages of equivariance and flow matching, ET-Flow significantly increases the precision and physical validity of the generated conformers, while being a lighter model and faster at inference.

| **[Pessimistic Backward Policy for GFlowNets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16012v3)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), which learn to sample objects proportionally to a given reward function through the trajectory of state transitions. In this work, we observe that GFlowNets tend to under-exploit the high-reward objects due to training on insufficient number of trajectories, which may lead to a large gap between the estimated flow and the (known) reward value. In response to this challenge, we propose a pessimistic backward policy for GFlowNets (PBP-GFN), which maximizes the observed flow to align closely with the true reward for the object. We extensively evaluate PBP-GFN across eight benchmarks, including hyper-grid environment, bag generation, structured set generation, molecular generation, and four RNA sequence generation tasks. In particular, PBP-GFN enhances the discovery of high-reward objects, maintains the diversity of the objects, and consistently outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Blurring Diffusion for Hierarchical Molecular Conformer Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20255v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can diffusion models process 3D geometries in a coarse-to-fine manner, akin to our multiscale view of the world? In this paper, we address the question by focusing on a fundamental biochemical problem of generating 3D molecular conformers conditioned on molecular graphs in a multiscale manner. Our approach consists of two hierarchical stages: i) generation of coarse-grained fragment-level 3D structure from the molecular graph, and ii) generation of fine atomic details from the coarse-grained approximated structure while allowing the latter to be adjusted simultaneously. For the challenging second stage, which demands preserving coarse-grained information while ensuring SE(3) equivariance, we introduce a novel generative model termed Equivariant Blurring Diffusion (EBD), which defines a forward process that moves towards the fragment-level coarse-grained structure by blurring the fine atomic details of conformers, and a reverse process that performs the opposite operation using equivariant networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EBD by geometric and chemical comparison to state-of-the-art denoising diffusion models on a benchmark of drug-like molecules. Ablation studies draw insights on the design of EBD by thoroughly analyzing its architecture, which includes the design of the loss function and the data corruption process. Codes are released at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/EBD .</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

To address this, the Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) representation was recently introduced as an alternative that streamlines those tasks. In this study, we investigate the optimal setups for training SAFE generative models, focusing on dataset size, data augmentation through randomization, model architecture, and bond disconnection algorithms. We found that larger, more diverse datasets improve performance, with the LLaMA architecture using Rotary Positional Embedding proving most robust. SAFE-based models also consistently outperform SMILES-based approaches in scaffold decoration and linker design, particularly with BRICS decomposition yielding the best results. These insights highlight key factors that significantly impact the efficacy of SAFE-based generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Design of Functional Metal Complexes Utilizing the Internal Knowledge of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18136v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing functional transition metal complexes (TMCs) faces challenges due to the vast search space of metals and ligands, requiring efficient optimization strategies. Traditional genetic algorithms (GAs) are commonly used, employing random mutations and crossovers driven by explicit mathematical objectives to explore this space. Transferring knowledge between different GA tasks, however, is difficult. We integrate large language models (LLMs) into the evolutionary optimization framework (LLM-EO) and apply it in both single- and multi-objective optimization for TMCs. We find that LLM-EO surpasses traditional GAs by leveraging the chemical knowledge of LLMs gained during their extensive pretraining. Remarkably, without supervised fine-tuning, LLMs utilize the full historical data from optimization processes, outperforming those focusing only on top-performing TMCs. LLM-EO successfully identifies eight of the top-20 TMCs with the largest HOMO-LUMO gaps by proposing only 200 candidates out of a 1.37 million TMCs space. Through prompt engineering using natural language, LLM-EO introduces unparalleled flexibility into multi-objective optimizations, thereby circumventing the necessity for intricate mathematical formulations. As generative models, LLMs can suggest new ligands and TMCs with unique properties by merging both internal knowledge and external chemistry data, thus combining the benefits of efficient optimization and molecular generation. With increasing potential of LLMs as pretrained foundational models and new post-training inference strategies, we foresee broad applications of LLM-based evolutionary optimization in chemistry and materials design.</p></details> |  |

Such virtual screening depends in part on methods to predict the binding affinity between ligands and proteins. Many computational models for binding affinity prediction have been developed, but with varying results across targets. Given that ensembling or meta-modeling approaches have shown great promise in reducing model-specific biases, we develop a framework to integrate published force-field-based empirical docking and sequence-based deep learning models. In building this framework, we evaluate many combinations of individual base models, training databases, and several meta-modeling approaches. We show that many of our meta-models significantly improve affinity predictions over base models. Our best meta-models achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art deep learning tools exclusively based on 3D structures, while allowing for improved database scalability and flexibility through the explicit inclusion of features such as physicochemical properties or molecular descriptors. We further demonstrate improved generalization capability by our models using a large-scale benchmark of affinity prediction as well as a virtual screening application benchmark. Overall, we demonstrate that diverse modeling approaches can be ensembled together to gain meaningful improvement in binding affinity prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 6 main tables, 6 main figures, 8 supplementary figures, and supporting information.

Current techniques for sampling ensembles are computationally inefficient, or do not transfer to systems outside their training data. We present walk-Jump Accelerated Molecular ensembles with Universal Noise (JAMUN), a step towards the goal of efficiently sampling the Boltzmann distribution of arbitrary proteins. By extending Walk-Jump Sampling to point clouds, JAMUN enables ensemble generation at orders of magnitude faster rates than traditional molecular dynamics or state-of-the-art ML methods. Further, JAMUN is able to predict the stable basins of small peptides that were not seen during training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Guided Multi-Property Molecular Optimization with a Diffusion Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13597v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization (MO) is a crucial stage in drug discovery in which task-oriented generated molecules are optimized to meet practical industrial requirements. Existing mainstream MO approaches primarily utilize external property predictors to guide iterative property optimization. However, learning all molecular samples in the vast chemical space is unrealistic for predictors. As a result, errors and noise are inevitably introduced during property prediction due to the nature of approximation. This leads to discrepancy accumulation, generalization reduction and suboptimal molecular candidates. In this paper, we propose a text-guided multi-property molecular optimization method utilizing transformer-based diffusion language model (TransDLM). TransDLM leverages standardized chemical nomenclature as semantic representations of molecules and implicitly embeds property requirements into textual descriptions, thereby preventing error propagation during diffusion process. Guided by physically and chemically detailed textual descriptions, TransDLM samples and optimizes encoded source molecules, retaining core scaffolds of source molecules and ensuring structural similarities. Moreover, TransDLM enables simultaneous sampling of multiple molecules, making it ideal for scalable, efficient large-scale optimization through distributed computation on web platforms. Furthermore, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in optimizing molecular structural similarity and enhancing chemical properties on the benchmark dataset.

In particular, designing molecules satisfying multi-parameter optimization objectives, while simultaneously being synthesizable and enforcing the presence of specific commercial building blocks in the synthesis. This is practically important for molecule re-purposing, sustainability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel reward function called TANimoto Group Overlap (TANGO), which uses chemistry principles to transform a sparse reward function into a dense and learnable reward function -- crucial for reinforcement learning. TANGO can augment general-purpose molecular generative models to directly optimize for constrained synthesizability while simultaneously optimizing for other properties relevant to drug discovery using reinforcement learning. Our framework is general and addresses starting-material, intermediate, and divergent synthesis constraints. Contrary to most existing works in the field, we show that incentivizing a general-purpose (without any inductive biases) model is a productive approach to navigating challenging optimization scenarios. We demonstrate this by showing that the trained models explicitly learn a desirable distribution. Our framework is the first generative approach to tackle constrained synthesizability.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, watermarking techniques have been developed primarily for rich information media such as images and audio. However, these methods have not been adequately adapted for graph-based data, particularly molecular graphs. Latent 3D graph diffusion(LDM-3DG) is an ascendant approach in the molecular graph generation field. This model effectively manages the complexities of molecular structures, preserving essential symmetries and topological features. We adapt the Gaussian Shading, a proven performance lossless watermarking technique, to the latent graph diffusion domain to protect this sophisticated new technology. Our adaptation simplifies the watermark diffusion process through duplication and padding, making it adaptable and suitable for various message types. We conduct several experiments using the LDM-3DG model on publicly available datasets QM9 and Drugs, to assess the robustness and effectiveness of our technique. Our results demonstrate that the watermarked molecules maintain statistical parity in 9 out of 10 performance metrics compared to the original. Moreover, they exhibit a 100% detection rate and a 99% extraction rate in a 2D decoded pipeline, while also showing robustness against post-editing attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models mostly work with SMILES and SELFIES chemical string representations, which lack spatial features vital for drug discovery. Additionally, attempts to translate chemical 3D structures into text format encounter issues such as excessive length and insufficient atom connectivity information. To address these issues, we introduce nach0-pc, a model combining domain-specific encoder and textual representation to handle spatial arrangement of atoms effectively. Our approach utilizes a molecular point cloud encoder for concise and order-invariant structure representation. We introduce a novel pre-training scheme for molecular point clouds to distillate the knowledge from spatial molecular structures datasets. After fine-tuning within both single-task and multi-task frameworks, nach0-pc demonstrates performance comparable with other diffusion models in terms of generated samples quality across several established spatial molecular generation tasks. Notably, our model is a multi-task approach, in contrast to diffusion models being limited to single tasks. Additionally, it is capable of processing point cloud-related data, which language models are not capable of handling due to memory limitations. These lead to our model having reduced training and inference time while maintaining on par performance.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce a multi-constraint molecular generation large language model, TSMMG, which, akin to a student, incorporates knowledge from various small models and tools, namely, the 'teachers'. To train TSMMG, we construct a large set of text-molecule pairs by extracting molecular knowledge from these 'teachers', enabling it to generate novel molecules that conform to the descriptions through various text prompts. We experimentally show that TSMMG remarkably performs in generating molecules meeting complex, natural language-described property requirements across two-, three-, and four-constraint tasks, with an average molecular validity of over 99% and success ratio of 82.58%, 68.03%, and 67.48%, respectively. The model also exhibits adaptability through zero-shot testing, creating molecules that satisfy combinations of properties that have not been encountered. It can comprehend text inputs with various language styles, extending beyond the confines of outlined prompts, as confirmed through empirical validation. Additionally, the knowledge distillation feature of TSMMG contributes to the continuous enhancement of small models, while the innovative approach to dataset construction effectively addresses the issues of data scarcity and quality, which positions TSMMG as a promising tool in the domains of drug discovery and materials science.</p></details> | 37 pages, 10 figures |

The packing structure of these materials plays a crucial role in determining their electronic and transport properties, which are key to enhancing the efficiency of devices like organic solar cells (OSCs). However, obtaining these optoelectronic properties computationally requires molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to generate a conformational ensemble, a process that can be computationally expensive due to the large system sizes involved. Recent advances have focused on using generative models, particularly flow-based models as Boltzmann generators, to improve the efficiency of MD sampling. In this work, we developed a dual-scale flow matching method that separates training and inference into coarse-grained and all-atom stages and enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of standard flow matching samplers.

Despite success in unconditional molecular generation, integrating multiple properties such as synthetic score and gas permeability as condition constraints into diffusion models remains unexplored. We present the Graph Diffusion Transformer (Graph DiT) for multi-conditional molecular generation. Graph DiT integrates an encoder to learn numerical and categorical property representations with the Transformer-based denoiser. Unlike previous graph diffusion models that add noise separately on the atoms and bonds in the forward diffusion process, Graph DiT is trained with a novel graph-dependent noise model for accurate estimation of graph-related noise in molecules.

This encoding converts complex molecular graphs into tree-structured formats, such as JSON and XML, which LLMs are particularly adept at processing due to their extensive pre-training on these types of data. By leveraging the flexibility of LLMs, our approach allows for intuitive interaction using natural language prompts, providing a more accessible interface for molecular design. Through supervised fine-tuning, G2T-LLM generates valid and coherent chemical structures, addressing common challenges like invalid outputs seen in traditional graph-based methods. While LLMs are computationally intensive, they offer superior generalization and adaptability, enabling the generation of diverse molecular structures with minimal task-specific customization. The proposed approach achieved comparable performances with state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark molecular generation datasets, demonstrating its potential as a flexible and innovative tool for AI-driven molecular design.</p></details> |  |

We propose 3M-Diffusion, a novel multi-modal molecular graph generation method, to generate diverse, ideally novel molecular structures with desired properties. 3M-Diffusion encodes molecular graphs into a graph latent space which it then aligns with the text space learned by encoder-based LLMs from textual descriptions. It then reconstructs the molecular structure and atomic attributes based on the given text descriptions using the molecule decoder. It then learns a probabilistic mapping from the text space to the latent molecular graph space using a diffusion model. The results of our extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that 3M-Diffusion can generate high-quality, novel and diverse molecular graphs that semantically match the textual description provided.</p></details> |  |

DiGress is a recent diffusion model for molecular graphs whose distinctive feature is allowing property targeting through classifier-based (CB) guidance. While CB guidance may work to generate molecular-like graphs, we hint at the fact that its assumptions apply poorly to the chemical domain. Based on this insight we propose a classifier-free DiGress (FreeGress), which works by directly injecting the conditioning information into the training process. CF guidance is convenient given its less stringent assumptions and since it does not require to train an auxiliary property regressor, thus halving the number of trainable parameters in the model. We empirically show that our model yields up to 79% improvement in Mean Absolute Error with respect to DiGress on property targeting tasks on QM9 and ZINC-250k benchmarks. As an additional contribution, we propose a simple yet powerful approach to improve chemical validity of generated samples, based on the observation that certain chemical properties such as molecular weight correlate with the number of atoms in molecules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ECML PKDD 2024</p></details> |
| **[When Molecular GAN Meets Byte-Pair Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19740v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), are pivotal in discovering novel drug-like candidates via de novo molecular generation. However, traditional character-wise tokenizers often struggle with identifying novel and complex sub-structures in molecular data. In contrast, alternative tokenization methods have demonstrated superior performance. This study introduces a molecular GAN that integrates a byte level byte-pair encoding tokenizer and employs reinforcement learning to enhance de novo molecular generation. Specifically, the generator functions as an actor, producing SMILES strings, while the discriminator acts as a critic, evaluating their quality. Our molecular GAN also integrates innovative reward mechanisms aimed at improving computational efficiency. Experimental results assessing validity, uniqueness, novelty, and diversity, complemented by detailed visualization analysis, robustly demonstrate the effectiveness of our GAN.</p></details> |  |

However, discovering novel materials with considerable SHG is challenging due to the time-consuming and costly nature of both experimental methods and first-principles calculations. In this study, we present a deep learning approach using the Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN) to predict NLO properties. Sourcing data from the Novel Opto-Electronic Materials Discovery (NOEMD) database and using the Kurtz-Perry (KP) coefficient as the key target, we developed a robust model capable of accurately estimating nonlinear optical responses. Our results demonstrate that the model achieves 82.5% accuracy at a tolerated absolute error up to 1 pm/V and relative error not exceeding 0.5. This work highlights the potential of deep learning in accelerating the discovery and design of advanced optical materials with desired properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Dynamic Graph Neural Networks for Small Occluded Object Detection and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17251v7)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small, occluded objects such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorbikes pose significant challenges for traffic surveillance systems because of their erratic movement, frequent occlusion, and poor visibility in dynamic urban environments. Traditional methods like YOLO11, while proficient in spatial feature extraction for precise detection, often struggle with these small and dynamically moving objects, particularly in handling real-time data updates and resource efficiency. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework that integrates dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) with YOLO11 to address these limitations. Unlike standard GNNs, DGNNs are chosen for their superior ability to dynamically update graph structures in real-time, which enables adaptive and robust tracking of objects in highly variable urban traffic scenarios. This framework constructs and regularly updates its graph representations, capturing objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, thus effectively responding to rapidly changing conditions. Additionally, DGNN-YOLO incorporates Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM visualization techniques to enhance interpretability and foster trust, offering insights into the model's decision-making process. Extensive experiments validate the framework's performance, achieving a precision of 0.8382, recall of 0.6875, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.6476, significantly outperforming existing methods. This study offers a scalable and interpretable solution for real-time traffic surveillance and significantly advances intelligent transportation systems' capabilities by addressing the critical challenge of detecting and tracking small, occluded objects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19820v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on graph neural networks (GNNs) has explored mechanisms for capturing local uncertainty and exploiting graph hierarchies to mitigate data sparsity and leverage structural properties. However, the synergistic integration of these two approaches remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel architecture, the Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural Network (HU-GNN), which unifies multi-scale representation learning, principled uncertainty estimation, and self-supervised embedding diversity within a single end-to-end framework. Specifically, HU-GNN adaptively forms node clusters and estimates uncertainty at multiple structural scales from individual nodes to higher levels. These uncertainty estimates guide a robust message-passing mechanism and attention weighting, effectively mitigating noise and adversarial perturbations while preserving predictive accuracy on both node- and graph-level tasks. We also offer key theoretical contributions, including a probabilistic formulation, rigorous uncertainty-calibration guarantees, and formal robustness bounds. Finally, by incorporating recent advances in graph contrastive learning, HU-GNN maintains diverse, structurally faithful embeddings. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art robustness and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

We mitigate this problem with a novel scheme that regulates the aggregation of messages, modulating the type and extent of message passing locally thereby preserving both the low and high-frequency components of information. Our approach relies solely on learnt embeddings, obviating the need for auxiliary labels, thus extending the benefits of heterophily-aware embeddings to broader applications, e.g., generative modelling. Our experiments, conducted across various data sets and GNN architectures, demonstrate performance enhancements and reveal heterophily patterns across standard classification benchmarks. Furthermore, application to molecular generation showcases notable performance improvements on chemoinformatics benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appearing in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Joint Detection and Decoding: A Graph Neural Network Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08871v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Narrowing the performance gap between optimal and feasible detection in inter-symbol interference (ISI) channels, this paper proposes to use graph neural networks (GNNs) for detection that can also be used to perform joint detection and decoding (JDD). For detection, the GNN is build upon the factor graph representations of the channel, while for JDD, the factor graph is expanded by the Tanner graph of the parity-check matrix (PCM) of the channel code, sharing the variable nodes (VNs). A particularly advantageous property of the GNN is a) the robustness against cycles in the factor graphs which is the main problem for sum-product algorithm (SPA)-based detection, and b) the robustness against channel state information (CSI) uncertainty at the receiver. Additionally, we propose using an input embedding resulting in a GNN independent of the channel impulse response (CIR). Consequently, a fully deep learning-based receiver enables joint optimization instead of individual optimization of the components, so-called end-to-end learning. Furthermore, we propose a parallel flooding schedule that also reduces the latency, which turns out to improve the error correcting performance. The proposed approach is analyzed and compared to state-of-the-art baselines for different modulations and codes in terms of error correcting capability and latency. The gain compared to SPA-based detection might be explained with improved messages between nodes and adaptive damping of messages. For a higher order modulation in a high-rate turbo detection and decoding (TDD) scenario the GNN shows a, at first glance, surprisingly high gain of 6.25 dB compared to the best, feasible non-neural baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Transactions on Communications (R1). arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.16187</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a graph representation of planning problems allying learning efficiency with the ability to detect symmetries, along with two pruning methods, action pruning and state pruning, designed to manage symmetries during search. The integration of these techniques into Fast Downward achieves a first-time success over LAMA on the latest IPC learning track dataset.

| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for Effective Label-free Node Classification in Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11983v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the preferred models for node classification in graph data due to their robust capabilities in integrating graph structures and attributes. However, these models heavily depend on a substantial amount of high-quality labeled data for training, which is often costly to obtain. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), a promising approach is to utilize their exceptional zero-shot capabilities and extensive knowledge for node labeling. Despite encouraging results, this approach either requires numerous queries to LLMs or suffers from reduced performance due to noisy labels generated by LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce Locle, an active self-training framework that does Label-free node Classification with LLMs cost-Effectively. Locle iteratively identifies small sets of "critical" samples using GNNs and extracts informative pseudo-labels for them with both LLMs and GNNs, serving as additional supervision signals to enhance model training. Specifically, Locle comprises three key components: (i) an effective active node selection strategy for initial annotations; (ii) a careful sample selection scheme to identify "critical" nodes based on label disharmonicity and entropy; and (iii) a label refinement module that combines LLMs and GNNs with a rewired topology. Extensive experiments on five benchmark text-attributed graph datasets demonstrate that Locle significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same query budget to LLMs in terms of label-free node classification. Notably, on the DBLP dataset with 14.3k nodes, Locle achieves an 8.08% improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art at a cost of less than one cent. Our code is available at https://github.com/HKBU-LAGAS/Locle.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

These methods construct graphs where image patches serve as nodes, and edges are established based on patch similarity or classification relevance. Despite their efficiency, the explainability of GNN-based vision models remains underexplored, even though graphs are naturally interpretable. In this work, we analyze the semantic consistency of the graphs formed at different layers of GNN-based image classifiers, focusing on how well they preserve object structures and meaningful relationships. A comprehensive analysis is presented by quantifying the extent to which inter-layer graph connections reflect semantic similarity and spatial coherence. Explanations from standard and adversarial settings are also compared to assess whether they reflect the classifiers' robustness. Additionally, we visualize the flow of information across layers through heatmap-based visualization techniques, thereby highlighting the models' explainability. Our findings demonstrate that the decision-making processes of these models can be effectively explained, while also revealing that their reasoning does not necessarily align with human perception, especially in deeper layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, accepted for presentation at xAI-World-Conference 2025, code is available at https://github.com/nickhaidos/Vision-GNNs-Explainer</p></details> |
| **[Intelligent4DSE: Optimizing High-Level Synthesis Design Space Exploration with Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19649v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level synthesis (HLS) design space exploration (DSE) is an optimization process in electronic design automation (EDA) that systematically explores high-level design configurations to achieve Pareto-optimal hardware implementations balancing performance, area, and power (PPA). To optimize this process, HLS prediction tasks often employ message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), leveraging complex architectures to achieve high accuracy. These predictors serve as evaluators in the DSE process, effectively bypassing the time-consuming estimations traditionally required by HLS tools. However, existing models often prioritize structural complexity and minimization of training loss, overlooking task-specific characteristics. Additionally, while evolutionary algorithms are widely used in DSE, they typically require extensive domain-specific knowledge to design effective crossover and mutation operators. To address these limitations, we propose CoGNNs-LLMEA, a framework that integrates a graph neural network with task-adaptive message passing and a large language model-enhanced evolutionary algorithm. As a predictive model, CoGNNs directly leverages intermediate representations generated from source code after compiler front-end processing, enabling prediction of quality of results (QoR) without invoking HLS tools. Due to its strong adaptability to tasks, CoGNNs can be tuned to predict post-HLS and post-implementation outcomes, effectively bridging the gap between high-level abstractions and physical implementation characteristics. CoGNNs achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in post-HLS QoR prediction, reducing mean prediction errors by 2.8$\times$ for latency and 3.4$\times$ for resource utilization compared to baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Reinforcement Learning for QoS-Aware Load Balancing in Open Radio Access Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19499v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next-generation wireless cellular networks are expected to provide unparalleled Quality-of-Service (QoS) for emerging wireless applications, necessitating strict performance guarantees, e.g., in terms of link-level data rates. A critical challenge in meeting these QoS requirements is the prevention of cell congestion, which involves balancing the load to ensure sufficient radio resources are available for each cell to serve its designated User Equipments (UEs). In this work, a novel QoS-aware Load Balancing (LB) approach is developed to optimize the performance of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Best Effort (BE) traffic in a multi-band Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) under QoS and resource constraints. The proposed solution builds on Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL), a powerful framework at the intersection of Graph Neural Network (GNN) and RL. The QoS-aware LB is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, with states represented as graphs. QoS consideration are integrated into both state representations and reward signal design. The LB agent is then trained using an off-policy dueling Deep Q Network (DQN) that leverages a GNN-based architecture. This design ensures the LB policy is invariant to the ordering of nodes (UE or cell), flexible in handling various network sizes, and capable of accounting for spatial node dependencies in LB decisions. Performance of the GRL-based solution is compared with two baseline methods. Results show substantial performance gains, including a $53\%$ reduction in QoS violations and a fourfold increase in the 5th percentile rate for BE traffic.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the proceedings of the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), Seventh Workshop on Data Driven Intelligence for Networks and Systems (DDINS)</p></details> |
| **[Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network for High-Energy Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01641v3)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid data surge from the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider introduces critical computational challenges requiring novel approaches for efficient data processing in particle physics. Quantum machine learning, with its capability to leverage the extensive Hilbert space of quantum hardware, offers a promising solution. However, current quantum graph neural networks (GNNs) lack robustness to noise and are often constrained by fixed symmetry groups, limiting adaptability in complex particle interaction modeling. This paper demonstrates that replacing the Lorentz Group Equivariant Block modules in LorentzNet with a dressed quantum circuit significantly enhances performance despite using nearly 5.5 times fewer parameters. Additionally, quantum circuits effectively replace MLPs by inherently preserving symmetries, with Lorentz symmetry integration ensuring robust handling of relativistic invariance. Our Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network (Lorentz-EQGNN) achieved $74.00\%$ test accuracy and an AUC of $87.38\%$ on the Quark-Gluon jet tagging dataset, outperforming the classical and quantum GNNs with a reduced architecture using only 4 qubits. On the Electron-Photon dataset, Lorentz-EQGNN reached $67.00\%$ test accuracy and an AUC of $68.20\%$, demonstrating competitive results with just 800 training samples. Evaluation of our model on generic MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets confirmed Lorentz-EQGNN's efficiency, achieving $88.10\%$ and $74.80\%$ test accuracy, respectively. Ablation studies validated the impact of quantum components on performance, with notable improvements in background rejection rates over classical counterparts. These results highlight Lorentz-EQGNN's potential for immediate applications in noise-resilient jet tagging, event classification, and broader data-scarce HEP tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional machine learning models remain effective in resource-limited environments due to their efficiency, requiring fewer parameters and less computational time. However, handling short and highly imbalanced datasets remains challenging. In this study, we propose the fusion of a Contrastive Attentive Graph Network and Graph Attention Network (CAGN-GAT Fusion) and benchmark it against 15 other models, including both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and traditional ML models. Our evaluation is conducted on four benchmark datasets (KDD-CUP-1999, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017) using a short and proportionally imbalanced dataset with a constant size of 5000 samples to ensure fairness in comparison. Results show that CAGN-GAT Fusion demonstrates stable and competitive accuracy, recall, and F1-score, even though it does not achieve the highest performance in every dataset. Our analysis also highlights the impact of adaptive graph construction techniques, including small changes in connections (edge perturbation) and selective hiding of features (feature masking), improving detection performance. The findings confirm that GNNs, particularly CAGN-GAT Fusion, are robust and computationally efficient, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments. Future work will explore GraphSAGE layers and multiview graph construction techniques to further enhance adaptability and detection accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 38th International Conference on Industrial, Engineering & Other Applications of Applied Intelligent Systems (IEA/AIE 2025), Kitakyushu, Japan, Jul 2025</p></details> |

This research proposes an innovative machine learning-based methodology for identifying malicious logic gates in gate-level netlists. By focusing on path retrace algorithms. The methodology is validated across three distinct cases, each employing different machine learning models to classify HTs. Case I utilizes a decision tree algorithm for node-to-node comparisons, significantly improving detection accuracy through the integration of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Case II introduces a graph-to-graph classification using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model, enabling the differentiation between normal and Trojan-infected circuit designs. Case III applies GNN-based node classification to identify individual compromised nodes and its location. Additionally, nearest neighbor (NN) method has been combined with GNN graph-to-graph in Case II and GNN node-to-node in Case III. Despite the potential of GNN model graph-to-graph classification, NN approach demonstrated superior performance, with the first nearest neighbor (1st NN) achieving 73.2% accuracy and the second nearest neighbor (2nd NN) method reaching 97.7%. In comparison, the GNN model achieved an accuracy of 62.8%. Similarly, GNN model node-to-node classification, NN approach demonstrated superior performance, with the 1st NN achieving 93% accuracy and the 2nd NN method reaching 97.7%. In comparison, the GNN model achieved an accuracy of 79.8%. However, higher and higher NN will lead to large code coverage for the identification of HTs.</p></details> |  |

Typically, these systems leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture user preferences by incorporating high-order social influences from observed social networks. However, existing graph-based social recommendations often overlook the fact that social networks are inherently noisy, containing task-irrelevant relationships that can hinder accurate user preference learning. The removal of these redundant social relations is crucial, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth. In this paper, we approach the social denoising problem from the perspective of graph invariant learning and propose a novel method, Social Graph Invariant Learning(SGIL). Specifically,SGIL aims to uncover stable user preferences within the input social graph, thereby enhancing the robustness of graph-based social recommendation systems. To achieve this goal, SGIL first simulates multiple noisy social environments through graph generators. It then seeks to learn environment-invariant user preferences by minimizing invariant risk across these environments. To further promote diversity in the generated social environments, we employ an adversarial training strategy to simulate more potential social noisy distributions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SGIL. The code is available at https://github.com/yimutianyang/SIGIR2025-SGIL.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches primarily rely on graph neural networks with temporal components or sequence generation models, which often focus narrowly on the historical context of target nodes. This limitation restricts the ability to adapt to new and emerging patterns in dynamic graphs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Dynamic Graph modeling (RAG4DyG), which enhances dynamic graph predictions by incorporating contextually and temporally relevant examples from broader graph structures. Our approach includes a time- and context-aware contrastive learning module to identify high-quality demonstrations and a graph fusion strategy to effectively integrate these examples with historical contexts. The proposed framework is designed to be effective in both transductive and inductive scenarios, ensuring adaptability to previously unseen nodes and evolving graph structures. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RAG4DyG in improving predictive accuracy and adaptability for dynamic graph modeling.

We introduce a novel presence-only SDM with graph neural networks (GNN). In our model, species and locations are treated as two distinct node sets, and the learning task is predicting detection records as the edges that connect locations to species. Using GNN for SDM allows us to model fine-grained interactions between species and the environment. We evaluate the potential of this methodology on the six-region dataset compiled by National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) for benchmarking SDMs. For each of the regions, the heterogeneous GNN model is comparable to or outperforms previously-benchmarked single-species SDMs as well as a feed-forward neural network baseline model.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures, |

Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted by IEEE TCOM</p></details> |

| **[Dual-channel Heterophilic Message Passing for Graph Fraud Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14205v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fraudulent activities have significantly increased across various domains, such as e-commerce, online review platforms, and social networks, making fraud detection a critical task. Spatial Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to fraud detection tasks due to their strong inductive learning capabilities. However, existing spatial GNN-based methods often enhance the graph structure by excluding heterophilic neighbors during message passing to align with the homophilic bias of GNNs. Unfortunately, this approach can disrupt the original graph topology and increase uncertainty in predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework, Dual-channel Heterophilic Message Passing (DHMP), for fraud detection. DHMP leverages a heterophily separation module to divide the graph into homophilic and heterophilic subgraphs, mitigating the low-pass inductive bias of traditional GNNs. It then applies shared weights to capture signals at different frequencies independently and incorporates a customized sampling strategy for training. This allows nodes to adaptively balance the contributions of various signals based on their labels.

Recent advancements in dynamic graph neural networks (DGNN), primarily by modeling the relationships among nodes via a message passing scheme, have significantly improved link prediction performance. However, DGNNs heavily rely on the pairwise node interactions, which neglect the common neighbor interaction in DGL. To address this limitation, we propose a High-order Graph Neural Networks with Common Neighbor Awareness (HGNN-CNA) for link prediction with two-fold ideas: a) estimating correlation score by considering multi-hop common neighbors for capturing the complex interaction between nodes; b) fusing the correlation into the message-passing process to consider common neighbor interaction directly in DGL. Experimental results on three real DGs demonstrate that the proposed HGNN-CNA acquires a significant accuracy gain over several state-of-the-art models on the link prediction task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted By ICAIS&ISAS 2025</p></details> |

While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reupl...</summary><p>Reuploaded with new version-- equation 16 was incorrect</p></details> |

In this case, different optimization algorithms that operate in the continuous space can be implemented to search neural architectures. However, the optimization of latent variables is challenging for gradient-based LSO since the mapping from the latent space to the architecture performance is generally non-convex. To tackle this problem, this paper develops a convexity regularized latent space optimization (CR-LSO) method, which aims to regularize the learning process of latent space in order to obtain a convex architecture performance mapping. Specifically, CR-LSO trains a graph variational autoencoder (G-VAE) to learn the continuous representations of discrete architectures. Simultaneously, the learning process of latent space is regularized by the guaranteed convexity of input convex neural networks (ICNNs). In this way, the G-VAE is forced to learn a convex mapping from the architecture representation to the architecture performance. Hereafter, the CR-LSO approximates the performance mapping using the ICNN and leverages the estimated gradient to optimize neural architecture representations. Experimental results on three popular NAS benchmarks show that CR-LSO achieves competitive evaluation results in terms of both computational complexity and architecture performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Testing Individual Fairness in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18353v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The biases in artificial intelligence (AI) models can lead to automated decision-making processes that discriminate against groups and/or individuals based on sensitive properties such as gender and race. While there are many studies on diagnosing and mitigating biases in various AI models, there is little research on individual fairness in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Unlike traditional models, which treat data features independently and overlook their inter-relationships, GNNs are designed to capture graph-based structure where nodes are interconnected. This relational approach enables GNNs to model complex dependencies, but it also means that biases can propagate through these connections, complicating the detection and mitigation of individual fairness violations. This PhD project aims to develop a testing framework to assess and ensure individual fairness in GNNs. It first systematically reviews the literature on individual fairness, categorizing existing approaches to define, measure, test, and mitigate model biases, creating a taxonomy of individual fairness. Next, the project will develop a framework for testing and ensuring fairness in GNNs by adapting and extending current fairness testing and mitigation techniques. The framework will be evaluated through industrial case studies, focusing on graph-based large language models.</p></details> | 6 pages |

We introduce the Intersecting Block Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges, we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion, while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes rather than edges.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach that models asteroids as nodes with orbital and physical features, connected by edges representing their similarities, using a NASA dataset of 958,524 records. Despite an extreme class imbalance with only 0.22% of the dataset with the hazardous label, our model achieves an overall accuracy of 99% and an AUC of 0.99, with a recall of 78% and an F1-score of 37% for hazardous asteroids after applying the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique. Feature importance analysis highlights albedo, perihelion distance, and semi-major axis as main predictors. This framework supports planetary defense missions and confirms AI's potential in enabling autonomous navigation for future missions such as NASA's NEO Surveyor and ESA's Ramses, offering an interpretable and scalable solution for asteroid hazard assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient GNN Training Through Structure-Aware Randomized Mini-Batching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18082v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable learning on realworld graphs and mini-batch training has emerged as the de facto standard for training GNNs because it can scale to very large graphs and improve convergence. Current mini-batch construction policies largely ignore efficiency considerations of GNN training. Specifically, existing mini-batching techniques employ randomization schemes to improve accuracy and convergence. However, these randomization schemes are often agnostic to the structural properties of the graph (for eg. community structure), resulting in highly irregular memory access patterns during GNN training that make suboptimal use of on-chip GPU caches. On the other hand, while deterministic mini-batching based solely on graph structure delivers fast runtime performance, the lack of randomness compromises both the final model accuracy and training convergence speed. In this paper, we present Community-structure-aware Randomized Mini-batching (COMM-RAND), a novel methodology that bridges the gap between the above extremes. COMM-RAND allows practitioners to explore the space between pure randomness and pure graph structural awareness during mini-batch construction, leading to significantly more efficient GNN training with similar accuracy. We evaluated COMM-RAND across four popular graph learning benchmarks. COMM-RAND cuts down GNN training time by up to 2.76x (1.8x on average) while achieving an accuracy that is within 1.79% points (0.42% on average) compared to popular random mini-batching approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniGraph2: Learning a Unified Embedding Space to Bind Multimodal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00806v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing foundation models, such as CLIP, aim to learn a unified embedding space for multimodal data, enabling a wide range of downstream web-based applications like search, recommendation, and content classification. However, these models often overlook the inherent graph structures in multimodal datasets, where entities and their relationships are crucial. Multimodal graphs (MMGs) represent such graphs where each node is associated with features from different modalities, while the edges capture the relationships between these entities. On the other hand, existing graph foundation models primarily focus on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) and are not designed to handle the complexities of MMGs. To address these limitations, we propose UniGraph2, a novel cross-domain graph foundation model that enables general representation learning on MMGs, providing a unified embedding space. UniGraph2 employs modality-specific encoders alongside a graph neural network (GNN) to learn a unified low-dimensional embedding space that captures both the multimodal information and the underlying graph structure. We propose a new cross-domain multi-graph pre-training algorithm at scale to ensure effective transfer learning across diverse graph domains and modalities. Additionally, we adopt a Mixture of Experts (MoE) component to align features from different domains and modalities, ensuring coherent and robust embeddings that unify the information across modalities. Extensive experiments on a variety of multimodal graph tasks demonstrate that UniGraph2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in tasks such as representation learning, transfer learning, and multimodal generative tasks, offering a scalable and flexible solution for learning on MMGs.</p></details> | WWW 2025 |

Typically, models deployed on immersive computing devices are static and limited to their default set of classes. The goal of our research is to provide users and developers with the capability to personalize their experience by adding new action classes to their device models continually. Importantly, a user should be able to add new classes in a low-shot and efficient manner, while this process should not require storing or replaying any of user's sensitive training data. We formalize this problem as privacy-aware few-shot continual action recognition. Towards this end, we propose POET: Prompt-Offset Tuning. While existing prompt tuning approaches have shown great promise for continual learning of image, text, and video modalities; they demand access to extensively pretrained transformers. Breaking away from this assumption, POET demonstrates the efficacy of prompt tuning a significantly lightweight backbone, pretrained exclusively on the base class data. We propose a novel spatio-temporal learnable prompt offset tuning approach, and are the first to apply such prompt tuning to Graph Neural Networks. We contribute two new benchmarks for our new problem setting in human action recognition: (i) NTU RGB+D dataset for activity recognition, and (ii) SHREC-2017 dataset for hand gesture recognition. We find that POET consistently outperforms comprehensive benchmarks.

| **[ScaleGNN: Towards Scalable Graph Neural Networks via Adaptive High-order Neighboring Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15920v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across various graph-based tasks by effectively capturing relational information between nodes. These models rely on iterative message passing to propagate node features, enabling nodes to aggregate information from their neighbors. Recent research has significantly improved the message-passing mechanism, enhancing GNN scalability on large-scale graphs. However, GNNs still face two main challenges: over-smoothing, where excessive message passing results in indistinguishable node representations, especially in deep networks incorporating high-order neighbors; and scalability issues, as traditional architectures suffer from high model complexity and increased inference time due to redundant information aggregation. This paper proposes a novel framework for large-scale graphs named ScaleGNN that simultaneously addresses both challenges by adaptively fusing multi-level graph features. We first construct neighbor matrices for each order, learning their relative information through trainable weights through an adaptive high-order feature fusion module. This allows the model to selectively emphasize informative high-order neighbors while reducing unnecessary computational costs. Additionally, we introduce a High-order redundant feature masking mechanism based on a Local Contribution Score (LCS), which enables the model to retain only the most relevant neighbors at each order, preventing redundant information propagation. Furthermore, low-order enhanced feature aggregation adaptively integrates low-order and high-order features based on task relevance, ensuring effective capture of both local and global structural information without excessive complexity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models in both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Existing deep learning models often lack spatial generalizability, rely on complex architectures, and struggle with real-time deployment. To address these limitations, we propose the Temporal Graph-based Digital Twin (TGDT), a scalable framework that integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks and Attentional Graph Neural Networks for dynamic, direction-aware traffic modeling and assessment at urban corridors. TGDT estimates key Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) for traffic flow optimization at both the intersection level (e.g., queue length, waiting time) and the corridor level (e.g., traffic volume, travel time). Its modular architecture and sequential optimization scheme enable easy extension to any number of intersections and MOEs. The model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by accurately producing high-dimensional, concurrent multi-output estimates. It also demonstrates high robustness and accuracy across diverse traffic conditions, including extreme scenarios, while relying on only a minimal set of traffic features. Fully parallelized, TGDT can simulate over a thousand scenarios within a matter of seconds, offering a cost-effective, interpretable, and real-time solution for traffic signal optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Deep Cut-informed Graph Embedding and Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06635v3)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph clustering aims to divide the graph into different clusters. The recently emerging deep graph clustering approaches are largely built on graph neural networks (GNN). However, GNN is designed for general graph encoding and there is a common issue of representation collapse in existing GNN-based deep graph clustering algorithms. We attribute two main reasons for such issues: (i) the inductive bias of GNN models: GNNs tend to generate similar representations for proximal nodes. Since graphs often contain a non-negligible amount of inter-cluster links, the bias results in error message passing and leads to biased clustering; (ii) the clustering guided loss function: most traditional approaches strive to make all samples closer to pre-learned cluster centers, which causes a degenerate solution assigning all data points to a single label thus making all samples similar and less discriminative. To address these challenges, we investigate graph clustering from a graph cut perspective and propose an innovative and non-GNN-based Deep Cut-informed Graph embedding and Clustering framework, namely DCGC. This framework includes two modules: (i) cut-informed graph encoding; (ii) self-supervised graph clustering via optimal transport. For the encoding module, we derive a cut-informed graph embedding objective to fuse graph structure and attributes by minimizing their joint normalized cut. For the clustering module, we utilize the optimal transport theory to obtain the clustering assignments, which can balance the guidance of "proximity to the pre-learned cluster center". With the above two tailored designs, DCGC is more suitable for the graph clustering task, which can effectively alleviate the problem of representation collapse and achieve better performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method is simple but effective compared with benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

They have demonstrated excellent performance in multiple domains involving graph-structured data. However, an important category of learning tasks, namely link weight prediction, has received less emphasis due to its increased complexity compared to binary link classification. Link weight prediction becomes even more challenging when considering multilayer networks, where nodes can be interconnected across multiple layers. To address these challenges, we propose a new method named Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN), which spatially embeds information across multiple layers to predict interlayer link weights. The MSGCN model generalizes spatial graph convolution to multiplex networks and captures the geometric structure of nodes across multiple layers. Extensive experiments using data with known interlayer link information show that the MSGCN model has robust, accurate, and generalizable link weight prediction performance across a wide variety of multiplex network structures.</p></details> |  |

Here, we present a structured way to improve the quality of these high-dimensional emulated outputs, through the use of prototypes: an approximation of the emulator's output passed as an input, which informs the model and leads to better predictions. We demonstrate our approach to emulate atmospheric dispersion, key for greenhouse gas emissions monitoring, by comparing a baseline model to models trained using prototypes as an additional input. The prototype models achieve better performance, even with few prototypes and even if they are chosen at random, but we show that choosing the prototypes through data-driven methods (k-means) can lead to almost 10\% increased performance in some metrics.</p></details> |  |

Traditional model-level explanation methods like XGNN and GNNInterpreter often fail to identify valid substructures like rings, leading to questionable interpretability. This limitation stems from XGNN's atom-by-atom approach and GNNInterpreter's reliance on average graph embeddings, which overlook the essential structural elements crucial for molecules. To address these gaps, we introduce an innovative \textbf{M}otif-b\textbf{A}sed \textbf{G}NN \textbf{E}xplainer (MAGE) that uses motifs as fundamental units for generating explanations. Our approach begins with extracting potential motifs through a motif decomposition technique. Then, we utilize an attention-based learning method to identify class-specific motifs. Finally, we employ a motif-based graph generator for each class to create molecular graph explanations based on these class-specific motifs. This novel method not only incorporates critical substructures into the explanations but also guarantees their validity, yielding results that are human-understandable. Our proposed method's effectiveness is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative assessments conducted on six real-world molecular datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.08419 The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations 2025</p></details> |

However, GNNs still encounter the challenge of structural imbalance. Prior solutions to this problem did not take graph heterophily into account, namely that connected nodes process distinct labels or features, thus resulting in a deficiency in effectiveness. Upon verifying the impact of heterophily on solving the structural imbalance problem, we propose to rectify the heterophily first and then transfer homophilic knowledge. To the end, we devise a method named HeRB (Heterophily-Resolved Structure Balancer) for GNNs. HeRB consists of two innovative components: 1) A heterophily-lessening augmentation module which serves to reduce inter-class edges and increase intra-class edges; 2) A homophilic knowledge transfer mechanism to convey homophilic information from head nodes to tail nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that HeRB achieves superior performance on two homophilic and six heterophilic benchmark datasets, and the ablation studies further validate the efficacy of two proposed components.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we proposed a novel architecture named Transformer based Encoder Decoder Network (TED Net) designed for estimating human skeleton poses from WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). TED Net integrates convolutional encoders with transformer based attention mechanisms to capture spatiotemporal features from CSI signals. The estimated skeleton poses were used as input to a customized Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) for action recognition. We validated our model on two datasets: a publicly available multi modal dataset for assessing general pose estimation, and a newly collected dataset focused on fall related scenarios involving 20 participants. Experimental results demonstrated that TED Net outperformed existing approaches in pose estimation, and that the DGNN achieves reliable action classification using CSI based skeletons, with performance comparable to RGB based systems. Notably, TED Net maintains robust performance across both fall and non fall cases. These findings highlight the potential of CSI driven human skeleton estimation for effective action recognition, particularly in home environments such as elderly fall detection. In such settings, WiFi signals are often readily available, offering a privacy preserving alternative to vision based methods, which may raise concerns about continuous camera monitoring.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

To further solve the subgraph matching problem, several recent advanced works attempt to utilize deep-learning-based techniques to handle the subgraph matching query. However, most of these works only obtain approximate results for subgraph matching without theoretical guarantees of accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective graph neural network (GNN)-based anchor embedding framework (GNN-AE), which allows exact subgraph matching. Unlike GNN-based approximate subgraph matching approaches that only produce inexact results, in this paper, we pioneer a series of concepts related to anchor (including anchor, anchor graph/path, etc.) in subgraph matching and carefully devise the anchor (graph) embedding technique based on GNN models. We transform the subgraph matching problem into a search problem in the embedding space via the anchor (graph & path) embedding techniques. With the proposed anchor matching mechanism, GNN-AE can guarantee subgraph matching has no false dismissals. We design an efficient matching growth algorithm, which can retrieve the locations of all exact matches in parallel. We also propose a cost-model-based DFS query plan to enhance the parallel matching growth algorithm. Through extensive experiments on 6 real-world and 3 synthetic datasets, we confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our GNN-AE approach for exact subgraph matching.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangled Graph Representation Based on Substructure-Aware Graph Optimal Matching Kernel Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16360v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs effectively characterize relational data, driving graph representation learning methods that uncover underlying predictive information. As state-of-the-art approaches, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable end-to-end learning for diverse tasks. Recent disentangled graph representation learning enhances interpretability by decoupling independent factors in graph data. However, existing methods often implicitly and coarsely characterize graph structures, limiting structural pattern analysis within the graph. This paper proposes the Graph Optimal Matching Kernel Convolutional Network (GOMKCN) to address this limitation. We view graphs as node-centric subgraphs, where each subgraph acts as a structural factor encoding position-specific information. This transforms graph prediction into structural pattern recognition. Inspired by CNNs, GOMKCN introduces the Graph Optimal Matching Kernel (GOMK) as a convolutional operator, computing similarities between subgraphs and learnable graph filters. Mathematically, GOMK maps subgraphs and filters into a Hilbert space, representing graphs as point sets. Disentangled representations emerge from projecting subgraphs onto task-optimized filters, which adaptively capture relevant structural patterns via gradient descent. Crucially, GOMK incorporates local correspondences in similarity measurement, resolving the trade-off between differentiability and accuracy in graph kernels. Experiments validate that GOMKCN achieves superior accuracy and interpretability in graph pattern mining and prediction. The framework advances the theoretical foundation for disentangled graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |

With the growing adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), CFG-based representations have proven highly effective for malware detection. This study proposes a novel framework that dynamically constructs CFGs and embeds node features using a hybrid approach combining rule-based encoding and autoencoder-based embedding. A GNN-based classifier is then constructed to detect malicious behavior from the resulting graph representations. To improve model interpretability, we apply state-of-the-art explainability techniques, including GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, and CaptumExplainer, the latter is utilized three attribution methods: Integrated Gradients, Guided Backpropagation, and Saliency. In addition, we introduce a novel aggregation method, called RankFusion, that integrates the outputs of the top-performing explainers to enhance the explanation quality. We also evaluate explanations using two subgraph extraction strategies, including the proposed Greedy Edge-wise Composition (GEC) method for improved structural coherence. A comprehensive evaluation using accuracy, fidelity, and consistency metrics demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of accurate identification of malware samples and generating reliable and interpretable explanations.</p></details> |  |

Various representation learning methods have been developed, including graph-based approaches for relationships among entities, sequence-based methods for capturing the temporal evolution of user activities, and content-based models for leveraging text and visual content. However, the development of a unifying framework that integrates these diverse techniques to support multiple applications remains a significant challenge. This paper presents OmniSage, a large-scale representation framework that learns universal representations for a variety of applications at Pinterest. OmniSage integrates graph neural networks with content-based models and user sequence models by employing multiple contrastive learning tasks to effectively process graph data, user sequence data, and content signals. To support the training and inference of OmniSage, we developed an efficient infrastructure capable of supporting Pinterest graphs with billions of nodes. The universal representations generated by OmniSage have significantly enhanced user experiences on Pinterest, leading to an approximate 2.5% increase in sitewide repins (saves) across five applications. This paper highlights the impact of unifying representation learning methods, and we will open source the OmniSage code by the time of publication.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches struggle to perform well in graph-structured scenarios where user data is correlated, such as traffic flow prediction and social relationship recommender systems. In particular, graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches lead to expensive server communication cost. To address this problem, we propose GraphEdge, an efficient GNN-based EC architecture. It considers the EC system of GNN tasks, where there are associations between users and it needs to take into account the task data of its neighbors when processing the tasks of a user. Specifically, the architecture first perceives the user topology and represents their data associations as a graph layout at each time step. Then the graph layout is optimized by calling our proposed hierarchical traversal graph cut algorithm (HiCut), which cuts the graph layout into multiple weakly associated subgraphs based on the aggregation characteristics of GNN, and the communication cost between different subgraphs during GNN inference is minimized. Finally, based on the optimized graph layout, our proposed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based graph offloading algorithm (DRLGO) is executed to obtain the optimal offloading strategy for the tasks of users, the offloading strategy is subgraph-based, it tries to offload user tasks in a subgraph to the same edge server as possible while minimizing the task processing time and energy consumption of the EC system.

This paper presents a novel approach combining a graph neural network-based exploration greedy policy with a safety shield to ensure safe navigation goal selection. The network is trained using reinforcement learning and the proximal policy optimization algorithm to maximize exploration efficiency while reducing the safety shield interventions. However, if the policy selects an infeasible action, the safety shield intervenes to choose the best feasible alternative, ensuring system consistency. Moreover, this paper proposes a reward function that includes a potential field based on the agent's proximity to unexplored regions and the expected information gain from reaching them. Overall, the approach investigated in this paper merges the benefits of the adaptability of reinforcement learning-driven exploration policies and the guarantee ensured by explicit safety mechanisms. Extensive evaluations in simulated environments demonstrate that the approach enables efficient and safe exploration in cluttered environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, submitted to the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

This survey presents a comprehensive exploration of how GNNs may be harnessed in 6G IoT environments, focusing on key challenges and opportunities through a series of open questions. We commence with an exploration of GNN paradigms and the roles of node, edge, and graph-level tasks in solving wireless networking problems and highlight GNNs' ability to overcome the limitations of traditional optimization methods. This guidance enhances problem-solving efficiency across various next-generation (NG) IoT scenarios. Next, we provide a detailed discussion of the application of GNN in advanced NG enabling technologies, including massive MIMO, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, satellites, THz, mobile edge computing (MEC), and ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC).

However, time-critical decisions in a dynamical environment limit the time available to gather supporting evidence. Infectious disease dynamics are often heterogeneous on a spatial or demographic scale, requiring appropriately resolved models. In addition, with a large number of potential interventions, all scenarios can barely be computed on time, even when using supercomputing facilities. We suggest to couple complex mechanistic models with data-driven surrogate models to allow for on-the-fly model adaptations by public health experts and decision makers. We build upon a spatially and demographically resolved infectious disease metapopulation model and train a graph neural network for data sets representing prevaccination phases of a pandemic. The resulting networks reached an execution time of a fraction of a second, a speeding up the metapopulation up to four orders of magnitude. The approach yields large potential for on-the-fly execution and, thus, facilitates integration into low-barrier web applications for use in pandemic decision-making.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |
| **[RiskNet: Interaction-Aware Risk Forecasting for Autonomous Driving in Long-Tail Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15541v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in long-tail scenarios remains a critical challenge, particularly under high uncertainty and complex multi-agent interactions. To address this, we propose RiskNet, an interaction-aware risk forecasting framework, which integrates deterministic risk modeling with probabilistic behavior prediction for comprehensive risk assessment. At its core, RiskNet employs a field-theoretic model that captures interactions among ego vehicle, surrounding agents, and infrastructure via interaction fields and force. This model supports multidimensional risk evaluation across diverse scenarios (highways, intersections, and roundabouts), and shows robustness under high-risk and long-tail settings. To capture the behavioral uncertainty, we incorporate a graph neural network (GNN)-based trajectory prediction module, which learns multi-modal future motion distributions. Coupled with the deterministic risk field, it enables dynamic, probabilistic risk inference across time, enabling proactive safety assessment under uncertainty. Evaluations on the highD, inD, and rounD datasets, spanning lane changes, turns, and complex merges, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional approaches (e.g., TTC, THW, RSS, NC Field) in terms of accuracy, responsiveness, and directional sensitivity, while maintaining strong generalization across scenarios. This framework supports real-time, scenario-adaptive risk forecasting and demonstrates strong generalization across uncertain driving environments. It offers a unified foundation for safety-critical decision-making in long-tail scenarios.</p></details> | 24 pages, 14 figures |
| **[ClusterViG: Efficient Globally Aware Vision GNNs via Image Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10640v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) have dominated the field of Computer Vision (CV). Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have performed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent complex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of GNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs (ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked due to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction. Recent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility of GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while introducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for designing efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image and constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph construction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global inter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using DEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG, for CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end inference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\times$ when compared against a suite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model parameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning strategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to be trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | IEEE MCNA 2025 |
| **[Measuring Interest Group Positions on Legislation: An AI-Driven Analysis of Lobbying Reports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15333v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Special interest groups (SIGs) in the U.S. participate in a range of political activities, such as lobbying and making campaign donations, to influence policy decisions in the legislative and executive branches. The competing interests of these SIGs have profound implications for global issues such as international trade policies, immigration, climate change, and global health challenges. Despite the significance of understanding SIGs' policy positions, empirical challenges in observing them have often led researchers to rely on indirect measurements or focus on a select few SIGs that publicly support or oppose a limited range of legislation. This study introduces the first large-scale effort to directly measure and predict a wide range of bill positions-Support, Oppose, Engage (Amend and Monitor)- across all legislative bills introduced from the 111th to the 117th Congresses. We leverage an advanced AI framework, including large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), to develop a scalable pipeline that automatically extracts these positions from lobbying activities, resulting in a dataset of 42k bills annotated with 279k bill positions of 12k SIGs. With this large-scale dataset, we reveal (i) a strong correlation between a bill's progression through legislative process stages and the positions taken by interest groups, (ii) a significant relationship between firm size and lobbying positions, (iii) notable distinctions in lobbying position distribution based on bill subject, and (iv) heterogeneity in the distribution of policy preferences across industries. We introduce a novel framework for examining lobbying strategies and offer opportunities to explore how interest groups shape the political landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Iterative Chainlet Partitioning Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone and Neural Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15147v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces the Iterative Chainlet Partitioning (ICP) algorithm and its neural acceleration for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone (TSP-D). The proposed ICP algorithm decomposes a TSP-D solution into smaller segments called chainlets, each optimized individually by a dynamic programming subroutine. The chainlet with the highest improvement is updated and the procedure is repeated until no further improvement is possible. The number of subroutine calls is bounded linearly in problem size for the first iteration and remains constant in subsequent iterations, ensuring algorithmic scalability. Empirical results show that ICP outperforms existing algorithms in both solution quality and computational time. Tested over 1,059 benchmark instances, ICP yields an average improvement of 2.75% in solution quality over the previous state-of-the-art algorithm while reducing computational time by 79.8%. The procedure is deterministic, ensuring reliability without requiring multiple runs. The subroutine is the computational bottleneck in the already efficient ICP algorithm. To reduce the necessity of subroutine calls, we integrate a graph neural network (GNN) to predict incremental improvements. We demonstrate that the resulting Neuro ICP (NICP) achieves substantial acceleration while maintaining solution quality. Compared to ICP, NICP reduces the total computational time by 49.7%, while the objective function value increase is limited to 0.12%. The framework's adaptability to various operational constraints makes it a valuable foundation for developing efficient algorithms for truck-drone synchronized routing problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Degree Bias in Graph Representation Learning with Learnable Structural Augmentation and Structural Self-Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15075v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) update node representations through message passing, which is primarily based on the homophily principle, assuming that adjacent nodes share similar features. However, in real-world graphs with long-tailed degree distributions, high-degree nodes dominate message passing, causing a degree bias where low-degree nodes remain under-represented due to inadequate messages. The main challenge in addressing degree bias is how to discover non-adjacent nodes to provide additional messages to low-degree nodes while reducing excessive messages for high-degree nodes. Nevertheless, exploiting non-adjacent nodes to provide valuable messages is challenging, as it could generate noisy information and disrupt the original graph structures. To solve it, we propose a novel Degree Fairness Graph Transformer, named DegFairGT, to mitigate degree bias by discovering structural similarities between non-adjacent nodes through learnable structural augmentation and structural self-attention. Our key idea is to exploit non-adjacent nodes with similar roles in the same community to generate informative edges under our augmentation, which could provide informative messages between nodes with similar roles while ensuring that the homophily principle is maintained within the community. To enable DegFairGT to learn such structural similarities, we then propose a structural self-attention to capture the similarities between node pairs. To preserve global graph structures and prevent graph augmentation from hindering graph structure, we propose a Self-Supervised Learning task to preserve p-step transition probability and regularize graph augmentation. Extensive experiments on six datasets showed that DegFairGT outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in degree fairness analysis, node classification, and node clustering tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE TNSE</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose an innovative approach that integrates multi-dimensional Hawkes processes with Graph Neural Network, modeling opinion propagation dynamics among nodes in a social network while considering the intricate hierarchical relationships between comments. The extended multi-dimensional Hawkes process captures the hierarchical structure, multi-dimensional interactions, and mutual influences across different topics, forming a complex propagation network. Moreover, recognizing the lack of high-quality datasets capable of comprehensively capturing the evolution of public opinion dynamics, we introduce a new dataset, VISTA. It includes 159 trending topics, corresponding to 47,207 posts, 327,015 second-level comments, and 29,578 third-level comments, covering diverse domains such as politics, entertainment, sports, health, and medicine. The dataset is annotated with detailed sentiment labels across 11 categories and clearly defined hierarchical relationships. When combined with our method, it offers strong interpretability by linking sentiment propagation to the comment hierarchy and temporal evolution. Our approach provides a robust baseline for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00142v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel graph neural network (GNN) designed to operate in hyperbolic spaces, leveraging the Lorentzian model to enhance graph representation learning. Existing GNNs primarily operate in Euclidean spaces, which can limit their ability to capture hierarchical and multi-relational structures inherent to complex graphs. LGIN addresses this by incorporating curvature-aware aggregation functions that preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor, ensuring embeddings remain constrained within the hyperbolic space by proposing a new update rule that effectively captures both local neighborhood interactions and global structural properties, enabling LGIN to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs with expressiveness at least as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Through extensive evaluation across nine benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures, LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNNs, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy in modeling complex graph structures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to extend the concept of a powerful graph neural network to Riemannian manifolds, paving the way for future advancements in hyperbolic graph learning.

| **[Edge-boosted graph learning for functional brain connectivity analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14796v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting disease states from functional brain connectivity is critical for the early diagnosis of severe neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. Existing studies commonly employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to infer clinical diagnoses from node-based brain connectivity matrices generated through node-to-node similarities of regionally averaged fMRI signals. However, recent neuroscience studies found that such node-based connectivity does not accurately capture ``functional connections" within the brain. This paper proposes a novel approach to brain network analysis that emphasizes edge functional connectivity (eFC), shifting the focus to inter-edge relationships. Additionally, we introduce a co-embedding technique to integrate edge functional connections effectively. Experimental results on the ADNI and PPMI datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN methods in classifying functional brain networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2025, 4 pages</p></details> |

To handle such complexity, operations teams rely on monitoring systems, including anomaly detection tools that identify unexpected behaviors. In this paper, we present c-ANEMON, a Contextual ANomaly dEtection MONitor for the RAN based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our solution captures spatio-temporal variations by analyzing the behavior of individual cells in relation to their local neighborhoods, enabling the detection of anomalies that are independent of external mobility factors. This, in turn, allows focusing on anomalies associated with network issues (e.g., misconfigurations, equipment failures). We evaluate c-ANEMON using real-world data from a large European metropolitan area (7,890 cells; 3 months). First, we show that the GNN model within our solution generalizes effectively to cells from previously unseen areas, suggesting the possibility of using a single model across extensive deployment regions. Then, we analyze the anomalies detected by c-ANEMON through manual inspection and define several categories of long-lasting anomalies (6+ hours). Notably, 45.95% of these anomalies fall into a category that is more likely to require intervention by operations teams.</p></details> | 7 pages |

It has also been observed that it underlies the design of several graph neural network architectures, whose capabilities and performance can be understood in terms of the expressive power of this test. Motivated by recent developments in machine learning applications to datasets involving three-dimensional objects, we study when the WL test is {\em complete} for clouds of euclidean points represented by complete distance graphs, i.e., when it can distinguish, up to isometry, any arbitrary such cloud. %arbitrary clouds of euclidean points represented by complete distance graphs. % How many dimensions of the Weisfeiler--Lehman test is enough to distinguish any two non-isometric point clouds in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, assuming that these point clouds are given as complete graphs labeled by distances between the points? This question is important for understanding, which architectures of graph neural networks are capable of fully exploiting the spacial structure of a point cloud. Our main result states that the $(d-1)$-dimensional WL test is complete for point clouds in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, for any $d\ge 2$, and that only three iterations of the test suffice. We also observe that the $d$-dimensional WL test only requires one iteration to achieve completeness. Our paper thus provides complete understanding of the 3-dimensional case: it was shown in previous works that 1-WL is not complete in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and we show that 2-WL is complete there. We also strengthen the lower bound for 1-WL by showing that it is unable to recognize planar point clouds in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Finally, we show that 2-WL is not complete in $\mathbb{R}^6$, leaving as an open question, whether it is complete in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ for $d = 4,5$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chang...</summary><p>Changes to previous version: new results, inability of 1-WL to recognize planar point clouds in R^3, and incompleteness of 2-WL in R^6</p></details> |

As numerical attributes become increasingly essential in characterizing entities and relations in KGs, the ability to reason over these attributes has gained significant importance. Existing graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs), primarily focus on aggregating homogeneous local neighbors and implicitly embedding diverse triples. However, these approaches often fail to fully leverage the potential of logical paths within the graph, limiting their effectiveness in exploiting the reasoning process. To address these limitations, we propose ChainsFormer, a novel chain-based framework designed to support numerical reasoning. Chainsformer not only explicitly constructs logical chains but also expands the reasoning depth to multiple hops. Specially, we introduces Relation-Attribute Chains (RA-Chains), a specialized logic chain, to model sequential reasoning patterns. ChainsFormer captures the step-by-step nature of multi-hop reasoning along RA-Chains by employing sequential in-context learning. To mitigate the impact of noisy chains, we propose a hyperbolic affinity scoring mechanism that selects relevant logic chains in a variable-resolution space. Furthermore, ChainsFormer incorporates an attention-based numerical reasoner to identify critical reasoning paths, enhancing both reasoning accuracy and transparency. Experimental results demonstrate that ChainsFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 20.0% improvement in performance. The implementations are available at https://github.com/zhaodazhuang2333/ChainsFormer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICDE 2025</p></details> |

While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions, text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |

We propose HIS_GCNs, a hierarchical importance graph sampling based learning method. By constructing minibatches using sampled subgraphs, HIS_GCNs gives attention to the importance of both core and periphery nodes/edges in a scale-free training graph. Specifically, it preserves the centrum of the core to most minibatches, which maintains connectivity between periphery nodes, and samples periphery edges without core node interference, in order to keep more long chains composed entirely of low-degree nodes in the same minibatch. HIS_GCNs can maximize the discrete Ricci curvature (i.e., Ollivier-Ricci curvatures) of the edges in a subgraph that enables the preservation of important chains for information propagation, and can achieve a low node embedding variance and a high convergence speed. Diverse experiments on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with node classification tasks confirm superior performance of HIS_GCNs in both accuracy and training time.

The expressivity of GNNs refers to their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs and depends on the encoding of node neighborhoods. We examine the vulnerability of neural multiset functions commonly used for this purpose and establish formal criteria to characterize a GNN's susceptibility to losing expressivity due to BFAs. This enables an analysis of the impact of homophily, graph structural variety, feature encoding, and activation functions on GNN robustness. We derive theoretical bounds for the number of bit flips required to degrade GNN expressivity on a dataset, identifying ReLU-activated GNNs operating on highly homophilous graphs with low-dimensional or one-hot encoded features as particularly susceptible. Empirical results using ten real-world datasets confirm the statistical significance of our key theoretical insights and offer actionable results to mitigate BFA risks in expressivity-critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AISTAST 2025, will add DOI when available</p></details> |

The set of relations between these radio nodes, referred to as the \emph{mobile network topology}, is vital in the construction of the networking infrastructure. Typically, the connections between radio nodes and their associated cells are defined by software features that establish mobility relations (referred to as \emph{edges} in this paper) within the mobile network graph through heuristic methods. Although these approaches are efficient, they encounter significant limitations, particularly since edges can only be established prior to the installation of physical hardware. In this work, we use graph-based deep learning methods to determine mobility relations (edges), trained on radio node configuration data and reliable mobility relations set by Automatic Neighbor Relations (ANR) in stable networks. This paper focuses on measuring the accuracy and precision of different graph-based deep learning approaches applied to real-world mobile networks. We evaluated two deep learning models. Our comprehensive experiments on Telecom datasets obtained from operational Telecom Networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the graph neural network (GNN) model and multilayer perceptron. Our evaluation showed that considering graph structure improves results, which motivates the use of GNNs. Additionally, we investigated the use of heuristics to reduce the training time based on the distance between radio nodes to eliminate irrelevant cases.

Graph-based sequential recommendation systems, powered by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), effectively capture complex user-item interactions but often face challenges such as noise and static representations. In this paper, we introduce the Adaptive Long-term Embedding with Denoising and Augmentation for Recommendation (ALDA4Rec) method, a novel model that constructs an item-item graph, filters noise through community detection, and enriches user-item interactions. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are then employed to learn short-term representations, while averaging, GRUs, and attention mechanisms are utilized to model long-term embeddings. An MLP-based adaptive weighting strategy is further incorporated to dynamically optimize long-term user preferences. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that ALDA4Rec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering notable improvements in both accuracy and robustness.

This task involves the extraction of sparse tree-like vascular branches from the volumetric space. However, existing methods have faced significant challenges due to discontinuous vascular segmentation and missing endpoints. To address this issue, a 3D vision graph neural network framework, named ViG3D-UNet, was introduced. This method integrates 3D graph representation and aggregation within a U-shaped architecture to facilitate continuous vascular segmentation. The ViG3D module captures volumetric vascular connectivity and topology, while the convolutional module extracts fine vascular details. These two branches are combined through channel attention to form the encoder feature. Subsequently, a paperclip-shaped offset decoder minimizes redundant computations in the sparse feature space and restores the feature map size to match the original input dimensions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for continuous vascular segmentation, evaluations were performed on two public datasets, ASOCA and ImageCAS. The segmentation results show that the ViG3D-UNet surpassed competing methods in maintaining vascular segmentation connectivity while achieving high segmentation accuracy.

Thus, the current prevailing paradigm focuses on 3D point-cloud atom representations, utilizing graph neural network (GNN) parametrizations, with rotational symmetries baked in via E(3) invariant layers. We prove that such models must necessarily disregard chirality, a geometric property of the molecules that cannot be superimposed on their mirror image by rotation and translation. Chirality plays a key role in determining drug safety and potency. To address this glaring issue, we introduce a novel field-based representation, proposing reference rotations that replace rotational symmetry constraints. The proposed model captures all molecular geometries including chirality, while still achieving highly competitive performance with E(3)-based methods across standard benchmarking metrics.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Subgraph Aggregation for Out-of-Distribution Generalization on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22228v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has gained significant attention due to its critical importance in graph-based predictions in real-world scenarios. Existing methods primarily focus on extracting a single causal subgraph from the input graph to achieve generalizable predictions. However, relying on a single subgraph can lead to susceptibility to spurious correlations and is insufficient for learning invariant patterns behind graph data. Moreover, in many real-world applications, such as molecular property prediction, multiple critical subgraphs may influence the target label property. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, SubGraph Aggregation (SuGAr), designed to learn a diverse set of subgraphs that are crucial for OOD generalization on graphs. Specifically, SuGAr employs a tailored subgraph sampler and diversity regularizer to extract a diverse set of invariant subgraphs. These invariant subgraphs are then aggregated by averaging their representations, which enriches the subgraph signals and enhances coverage of the underlying causal structures, thereby improving OOD generalization. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that \ours outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 24% improvement in OOD generalization on graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study graph OOD generalization by learning multiple invariant subgraphs. code: https://github.com/Nanolbw/SuGAr</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bounded and Uniform Energy-based Out-of-distribution Detection for Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13429v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the critical role of graphs in real-world applications and their high-security requirements, improving the ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data is an urgent research problem. The recent work GNNSAFE proposes a framework based on the aggregation of negative energy scores that significantly improves the performance of GNNs to detect node-level OOD data. However, our study finds that score aggregation among nodes is susceptible to extreme values due to the unboundedness of the negative energy scores and logit shifts, which severely limits the accuracy of GNNs in detecting node-level OOD data. In this paper, we propose NODESAFE: reducing the generation of extreme scores of nodes by adding two optimization terms that make the negative energy scores bounded and mitigate the logit shift. Experimental results show that our approach dramatically improves the ability of GNNs to detect OOD data at the node level, e.g., in detecting OOD data induced by Structure Manipulation, the metric of FPR95 (lower is better) in scenarios without (with) OOD data exposure are reduced from the current SOTA by 28.4% (22.7%).</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2302.02914 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Graph Learning at Scale: Characterizing and Optimizing Pre-Propagation GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13266v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning node embeddings in graphs, typically adopting a message-passing scheme. This approach, however, leads to the neighbor explosion problem, with exponentially growing computational and memory demands as layers increase. Graph sampling has become the predominant method for scaling GNNs to large graphs, mitigating but not fully solving the issue. Pre-propagation GNNs (PP-GNNs) represent a new class of models that decouple feature propagation from training through pre-processing, addressing neighbor explosion in theory. Yet, their practical advantages and system-level optimizations remain underexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of PP-GNNs, comparing them with graph-sampling-based methods in training efficiency, scalability, and accuracy. While PP-GNNs achieve comparable accuracy, we identify data loading as the key bottleneck for training efficiency and input expansion as a major scalability challenge. To address these issues, we propose optimized data loading schemes and tailored training methods that improve PP-GNN training throughput by an average of 15$\times$ over the PP-GNN baselines, with speedup of up to 2 orders of magnitude compared to sampling-based GNNs on large graph benchmarks. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/cornell-zhang/preprop-gnn.</p></details> |  |
| **[AHSG: Adversarial Attack on High-level Semantics in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07468v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks on Graph Neural Networks aim to perturb the performance of the learner by carefully modifying the graph topology and node attributes. Existing methods achieve attack stealthiness by constraining the modification budget and differences in graph properties. However, these methods typically disrupt task-relevant primary semantics directly, which results in low defensibility and detectability of the attack. In this paper, we propose an Adversarial Attack on High-level Semantics for Graph Neural Networks (AHSG), which is a graph structure attack model that ensures the retention of primary semantics. By combining latent representations with shared primary semantics, our model retains detectable attributes and relational patterns of the original graph while leveraging more subtle changes to carry out the attack. Then we use the Projected Gradient Descent algorithm to map the latent representations with attack effects to the adversarial graph. Through experiments on robust graph deep learning models equipped with defense strategies, we demonstrate that AHSG outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in attack effectiveness. Additionally, using Contextual Stochastic Block Models to detect the attacked graph further validates that our method preserves the primary semantics of the graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-friendly Graph Compression for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13034v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising performance in graph analysis. Nevertheless, the inference process of GNNs remains costly, hindering their applications for large graphs. This paper proposes inference-friendly graph compression (IFGC), a graph compression scheme to accelerate GNNs inference. Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed graph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that the result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little decompression cost. (1) We characterize IFGC with a class of inference equivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in $G$ that are not distinguishable for GNN inference. (2) We introduce three practical specifications of IFGC for representative GNNs: structural preserving compression (SPGC), which computes $G_c$ that can be directly processed by GNN inference without decompression; ($\alpha$, $r$)-compression, that allows for a configurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and anchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of interest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms with guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse sets of large-scale graphs, which verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our graph compression approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Physics and Topology in Neural Networks for Learning Rigid Body Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11467v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigid body interactions are fundamental to numerous scientific disciplines, but remain challenging to simulate due to their abrupt nonlinear nature and sensitivity to complex, often unknown environmental factors. These challenges call for adaptable learning-based methods capable of capturing complex interactions beyond explicit physical models and simulations. While graph neural networks can handle simple scenarios, they struggle with complex scenes and long-term predictions. We introduce a novel framework for modeling rigid body dynamics and learning collision interactions, addressing key limitations of existing graph-based methods. Our approach extends the traditional representation of meshes by incorporating higher-order topology complexes, offering a physically consistent representation. Additionally, we propose a physics-informed message-passing neural architecture, embedding physical laws directly in the model. Our method demonstrates superior accuracy, even during long rollouts, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen scenarios. Importantly, this work addresses the challenge of multi-entity dynamic interactions, with applications spanning diverse scientific and engineering domains.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |

On one side, Full Order Models (FOMs) deliver accurate hemodynamic assessments, but their high computational demands hinder their real-time clinical application. In contrast, Reduced Order Models (ROMs) provide more efficient yet accurate solutions, essential for personalized healthcare and timely clinical decision-making. In this work, we explore the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in cardiovascular medicine by integrating FOMs with ROMs for predicting the risk of aortic aneurysm growth and rupture. Wall Shear Stress (WSS) and the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), sampled at different growth stages of the thoracic aortic aneurysm, are predicted by means of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs exploit the natural graph structure of the mesh obtained by the Finite Volume (FV) discretization, taking into account the spatial local information, regardless of the dimension of the input graph. Our experimental validation framework yields promising results, confirming our method as a valid alternative that overcomes the curse of dimensionality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling Molecular Moieties through Hierarchical Grad-CAM Graph Explainability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01744v4)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Virtual Screening (VS) has become an essential tool in drug discovery, enabling the rapid and cost-effective identification of potential bioactive molecules. Among recent advancements, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to model complex molecular structures using graph-based representations. However, the integration of explainable methods to elucidate the specific contributions of molecular substructures to biological activity remains a significant challenge. This limitation hampers both the interpretability of predictive models and the rational design of novel therapeutics.\\ Results: We trained 20 GNN models on a dataset of small molecules with the goal of predicting their activity on 20 distinct protein targets from the Kinase family. These classifiers achieved state-of-the-art performance in virtual screening tasks, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness on different targets. Building upon these models, we implemented the Hierarchical Grad-CAM graph Explainer (HGE) framework, enabling an in-depth analysis of the molecular moieties driving protein-ligand binding stabilization. HGE exploits Grad-CAM explanations at the atom, ring, and whole-molecule levels, leveraging the message-passing mechanism to highlight the most relevant chemical moieties. Validation against experimental data from the literature confirmed the ability of the explainer to recognize a molecular pattern of drugs and correctly annotate them to the known target. Conclusion: Our approach may represent a valid support to shorten both the screening and the hit discovery process. Detailed knowledge of the molecular substructures that play a role in the binding process can help the computational chemist to gain insights into the structure optimization, as well as in drug repurposing tasks.</p></details> |  |

Scene understanding is the basis for any further reactive or proactive decision-making. Scene understanding and related reasoning is inherently an explanation task: why is another traffic participant doing something, what or who caused their actions? While previous work demonstrated QXGs' effectiveness using shallow machine learning models, these approaches were limited to analysing single relation chains between object pairs, disregarding the broader scene context. We propose a novel GNN architecture that processes entire graph structures to identify relevant objects in traffic scenes. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset enriched with DriveLM's human-annotated relevance labels. Experimental results show that our GNN-based approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods. The model effectively handles the inherent class imbalance in relevant object identification tasks while considering the complete spatial-temporal relationships between all objects in the scene. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining qualitative representations with deep learning approaches for explainable scene understanding in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop "Advancing Automated Driving in Highly Interactive Scenarios through Behavior Prediction, Trustworthy AI, and Remote Operations" @ 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

Prior studies have attempted to mitigating the impact of distribution shift by reconstructing node features during the testing phase without modifying the model parameters. However, these approaches lack theoretical analysis of the proximity between predictions and ground truth at test time. In this paper, we propose a novel node feature reconstruction method grounded in Lyapunov stability theory. Specifically, we model the GNN as a control system during the testing phase, considering node features as control variables. A neural controller that adheres to the Lyapunov stability criterion is then employed to reconstruct these node features, ensuring that the predictions progressively approach the ground truth at test time. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

It reduces the number of decision variables in a problem by solving a pricing problem. For many CO problems, the pricing problem is an Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (ESPPRC). Large ESPPRC instances are difficult to solve to near-optimality. Consequently, we use a Graph neural Network (GNN) to reduces the size of the ESPPRC such that it becomes computationally tractable with standard solving techniques. Our GNN is trained by Unsupervised Learning and outputs a distribution for the arcs to be retained in the reduced PP. The reduced PP is solved by a local search that finds columns with large reduced costs and speeds up convergence. We apply our method on a set of Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows and show significant improvements in convergence compared to simple reduction techniques from the literature. For a fixed computational budget, we improve the objective values by over 9\% for larger instances. We also analyze the performance of our CG algorithm and test the generalization of our method to different classes of instances than the training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Nonetheless, many proposed hypergraph neural networks effectively reduce hypergraphs to undirected graphs via symmetrized matrix representations, potentially losing important information. We propose an alternative approach to hypergraph neural networks in which the hypergraph is represented as a non-reversible Markov chain. We use this Markov chain to construct a complex Hermitian Laplacian matrix - the magnetic Laplacian - which serves as the input to our proposed hypergraph neural network. We study HyperMagNet for the task of node classification, and demonstrate its effectiveness over graph-reduction based hypergraph neural networks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Transfer Learning for Temporal Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10925v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction on graphs has applications spanning from recommender systems to drug discovery. Temporal link prediction (TLP) refers to predicting future links in a temporally evolving graph and adds additional complexity related to the dynamic nature of graphs. State-of-the-art TLP models incorporate memory modules alongside graph neural networks to learn both the temporal mechanisms of incoming nodes and the evolving graph topology. However, memory modules only store information about nodes seen at train time, and hence such models cannot be directly transferred to entirely new graphs at test time and deployment. In this work, we study a new transfer learning task for temporal link prediction, and develop transfer-effective methods for memory-laden models. Specifically, motivated by work showing the informativeness of structural signals for the TLP task, we augment a structural mapping module to the existing TLP model architectures, which learns a mapping from graph structural (topological) features to memory embeddings. Our work paves the way for a memory-free foundation model for TLP.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However, GNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data and it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge, we explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across diverse Density Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold Molecular Dynamics. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for unobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of lightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials modeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning strategies.</p></details> |  |

They have also been applied in safety-critical environments where perturbations inherently occur. However, these perturbations require us to formally verify neural networks before their deployment in safety-critical environments as neural networks are prone to adversarial attacks. While there exists research on the formal verification of neural networks, there is no work verifying the robustness of generic graph convolutional network architectures with uncertainty in the node features and in the graph structure over multiple message-passing steps. This work addresses this research gap by explicitly preserving the non-convex dependencies of all elements in the underlying computations through reachability analysis with (matrix) polynomial zonotopes.

However, it remains uncertain whether these methods effectively reflect essential graph properties, precisely representation similarity with its neighbors. We observe that existing methods position opposite ends of a spectrum driven by the graph embedding smoothness, with each end corresponding to outperformance on specific downstream tasks. Decomposing the SSL objective into three terms via an information-theoretic framework with a neighbor representation variable reveals that this polarization stems from an imbalance among the terms, which existing methods may not effectively maintain. Further insights suggest that balancing between the extremes can lead to improved performance across a wider range of downstream tasks. A framework, BSG (Balancing Smoothness in Graph SSL), introduces novel loss functions designed to supplement the representation quality in graph-based SSL by balancing the derived three terms: neighbor loss, minimal loss, and divergence loss. We present a theoretical analysis of the effects of these loss functions, highlighting their significance from both the SSL and graph smoothness perspectives. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets across node classification and link prediction consistently demonstrate that BSG achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.

However, GNN methods for solving Weighted MaxSAT problems remain underdeveloped. The challenges arise from the non-linear dependency and sensitive objective function, which are caused by the non-uniform distribution of weights across clauses. In this paper, we present HyperSAT, a novel neural approach that employs an unsupervised hypergraph neural network model to solve Weighted MaxSAT problems. We propose a hypergraph representation for Weighted MaxSAT instances and design a cross-attention mechanism along with a shared representation constraint loss function to capture the logical interactions between positive and negative literal nodes in the hypergraph. Extensive experiments on various Weighted MaxSAT datasets demonstrate that HyperSAT achieves better performance than state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> |  |

Although these approaches show the potential of Transformers in capturing long-range graph topology information, issues concerning the quadratic complexity and high computing energy consumption severely limit the scalability of GTs on large-scale graphs. Recently, as brain-inspired neural networks, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), facilitate the development of graph representation learning methods with lower computational and storage overhead through the unique event-driven spiking neurons. Inspired by these characteristics, we propose a linear-time Graph Transformer using Spiking Vector Quantization (GT-SVQ) for node classification. GT-SVQ reconstructs codebooks based on rate coding outputs from spiking neurons, and injects the codebooks into self-attention blocks to aggregate global information in linear complexity. Besides, spiking vector quantization effectively alleviates codebook collapse and the reliance on complex machinery (distance measure, auxiliary loss, etc.) present in previous vector quantization-based graph learning methods. In experiments, we compare GT-SVQ with other state-of-the-art baselines on node classification datasets ranging from small to large. Experimental results show that GT-SVQ has achieved competitive performances on most datasets while maintaining up to 130x faster inference speed compared to other GTs.</p></details> | work in progress |

However, centralizing large volumes of real-world graph data for GNN training is often impractical due to privacy concerns, regulatory restrictions, and commercial competition. Federated learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm, offers a solution by preserving data privacy with collaborative model training. Despite progress in training huge vision and language models, federated learning for GNNs remains underexplored. To address this challenge, we present a novel method for federated learning on GNNs based on spectral GNNs equipped with neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) for better information capture, showing promising results across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Our approach effectively handles non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, while also achieving performance comparable to existing methods that only operate on IID data. It is designed to be privacy-preserving and bandwidth-optimized, making it suitable for real-world applications such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and fraud detection, which often involve complex, non-IID, and heterophilic graph structures. Our results in the area of federated learning on non-IID heterophilic graphs demonstrate significant improvements, while also achieving better performance on homophilic graphs.

Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer a promising approach for efficient garment simulation. However, GNNs require extensive message-passing to propagate information such as physical forces and maintain contact awareness across the entire garment mesh, which becomes computationally inefficient at higher resolutions. To address this, we devise a novel GNN-based mesh learning framework with two key components to extend the message-passing range with minimal overhead, namely the Laplacian-Smoothed Dual Message-Passing (LSDMP) and the Geodesic Self-Attention (GSA) modules. LSDMP enhances message-passing with a Laplacian features smoothing process, which efficiently propagates the impact of each vertex to nearby vertices. Concurrently, GSA introduces geodesic distance embeddings to represent the spatial relationship between vertices and utilises attention mechanisms to capture global mesh information. The two modules operate in parallel to ensure both short- and long-range mesh modelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, requiring fewer layers and lower inference latency.</p></details> |  |

However, this introduces a potential privacy problem as this data can be tracked and analysed, which can reveal user-behaviour information. A user behaviour analysis pipeline was proposed to present how this type of information can be extracted and analysed to identify separate behavioural clusters that can describe how users behave in the game. The pipeline starts with the collection of transaction data, involving smart contracts, that is collected from a blockchain-based game called Planet IX. Both the raw transaction information and the transaction events are considered in the data collection. From this data, separate game actions can be formed and those are leveraged to present how and when the users conducted their in-game activities in the form of user flows. An extended version of these user flows also presents how the Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are being leveraged in the user actions. The latter is given as input for a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to provide graph embeddings for these flows which then can be leveraged by clustering algorithms to cluster user behaviours into separate behavioural clusters. We benchmark and compare well-known clustering algorithms as a part of the proposed method. The user behaviour clusters were analysed and visualised in a graph format. It was found that behavioural information can be extracted regarding the users that belong to these clusters. Such information can be exploited by malicious users to their advantage. To demonstrate this, a privacy threat model was also presented based on the results that correspond to multiple potentially affected areas.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Blockchain: Research and Applications</p></details> |

We propose H$^3$GNNs, an end-to-end self-supervised learning framework that harmonizes both structural properties through two key innovations: (i) Joint Structural Node Encoding. We embed nodes into a unified space combining linear and non-linear feature projections with K-hop structural representations via a Weighted Graph Convolution Network(WGCN). A cross-attention mechanism enhances awareness and adaptability to heterophily and homophily.

We use a teacher-student model, the student sees the masked input graph and predicts node features inferred by the teacher that sees the full input graph in the joint encoding space. To enhance learning difficulty, we introduce two novel node-predictive-difficulty-based masking strategies. Experiments on seven benchmarks (four heterophily datasets and three homophily datasets) confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of H$^3$GNNs across diverse graph types. Our H$^3$GNNs achieves overall state-of-the-art performance on the four heterophily datasets, while retaining on-par performance to previous state-of-the-art methods on the three homophily datasets.</p></details> |  |

When certain entities exist across multiple systems simultaneously, unveiling their corresponding relationships across the networks becomes crucial. This problem, known as network alignment, holds significant importance. It enhances our understanding of complex system structures and behaviours, facilitates the validation and extension of theoretical physics research about studying complex systems, and fosters diverse practical applications across various fields. However, due to variations in the structure, characteristics, and properties of complex networks across different fields, the study of network alignment is often isolated within each domain, with even the terminologies and concepts lacking uniformity.

This paper introduces an innovative multimodal feature learning framework for personality analysis in short video clips. For visual processing, we construct a facial graph and design a Geo-based two-stream network incorporating an attention mechanism, leveraging both Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to capture static facial expressions. Additionally, ResNet18 and VGGFace networks are employed to extract global scene and facial appearance features at the frame level. To capture dynamic temporal information, we integrate a BiGRU with a temporal attention module for extracting salient frame representations. To enhance the model's robustness, we incorporate the VGGish CNN for audio-based features and XLM-Roberta for text-based features. Finally, a multimodal channel attention mechanism is introduced to integrate different modalities, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression model is used to predict personality traits. Experimental results confirm that our proposed framework surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Re-Ranking with Non-Visual Side Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11134v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard approach for visual place recognition is to use global image descriptors to retrieve the most similar database images for a given query image. The results can then be further improved with re-ranking methods that re-order the top scoring images. However, existing methods focus on re-ranking based on the same image descriptors that were used for the initial retrieval, which we argue provides limited additional signal. In this work we propose Generalized Contextual Similarity Aggregation (GCSA), which is a graph neural network-based re-ranking method that, in addition to the visual descriptors, can leverage other types of available side information. This can for example be other sensor data (such as signal strength of nearby WiFi or BlueTooth endpoints) or geometric properties such as camera poses for database images. In many applications this information is already present or can be acquired with low effort. Our architecture leverages the concept of affinity vectors to allow for a shared encoding of the heterogeneous multi-modal input. Two large-scale datasets, covering both outdoor and indoor localization scenarios, are utilized for training and evaluation. In experiments we show significant improvement not only on image retrieval metrics, but also for the downstream visual localization task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis (SCIA) 2025</p></details> |

However, attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors and their risks have rarely been studied, thereby leaving potential threats unaddressed. Recent findings suggest that frauds are increasingly organized as gangs or groups. In this work, we design attack scenarios where fraud gangs aim to make their fraud nodes misclassified as benign by camouflaging their illicit activities in collusion. Based on these scenarios, we study adversarial attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors by simulating attacks of fraud gangs in three real-world fraud cases: spam reviews, fake news, and medical insurance frauds. We define these attacks as multi-target graph injection attacks and propose MonTi, a transformer-based Multi-target one-Time graph injection attack model. MonTi simultaneously generates attributes and edges of all attack nodes with a transformer encoder, capturing interdependencies between attributes and edges more effectively than most existing graph injection attack methods that generate these elements sequentially. Additionally, MonTi adaptively allocates the degree budget for each attack node to explore diverse injection structures involving target, candidate, and attack nodes, unlike existing methods that fix the degree budget across all attack nodes. Experiments show that MonTi outperforms the state-of-the-art graph injection attack methods on five real-world graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, 12 tables, The 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025)</p></details> |

Recent advances in protein structure prediction and machine learning-driven molecule generation offer a promising opportunity to accelerate drug discovery. However, practical guidance on selecting and integrating these models into real-world pipelines remains limited. In this study, we develop an end-to-end, artificial intelligence-guided antibiotic discovery pipeline that spans target identification to compound realization. We leverage structure-based clustering across predicted proteomes of multiple pathogens to identify conserved, essential, and non-human-homologous targets. We then systematically evaluate six leading 3D-structure-aware generative models$\unicode{x2014}$spanning diffusion, autoregressive, graph neural network, and language model architectures$\unicode{x2014}$on their usability, chemical validity, and biological relevance. Rigorous post-processing filters and commercial analogue searches reduce over 100 000 generated compounds to a focused, synthesizable set. Our results highlight DeepBlock and TamGen as top performers across diverse criteria, while also revealing critical trade-offs between model complexity, usability, and output quality. This work provides a comparative benchmark and blueprint for deploying artificial intelligence in early-stage antibiotic development.</p></details> | 12 pages, preprint |
| **[Why am I seeing this? Towards recognizing social media recommender systems with missing recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11000v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media plays a crucial role in shaping society, often amplifying polarization and spreading misinformation. These effects stem from complex dynamics involving user interactions, individual traits, and recommender algorithms driving content selection. Recommender systems, which significantly shape the content users see and decisions they make, offer an opportunity for intervention and regulation. However, assessing their impact is challenging due to algorithmic opacity and limited data availability. To effectively model user decision-making, it is crucial to recognize the recommender system adopted by the platform. This work introduces a method for Automatic Recommender Recognition using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), based solely on network structure and observed behavior. To infer the hidden recommender, we first train a Recommender Neutral User model (RNU) using a GNN and an adapted hindsight academic network recommender, aiming to reduce reliance on the actual recommender in the data. We then generate several Recommender Hypothesis-specific Synthetic Datasets (RHSD) by combining the RNU with different known recommenders, producing ground truths for testing. Finally, we train Recommender Hypothesis-specific User models (RHU) under various hypotheses and compare each candidate with the original used to generate the RHSD. Our approach enables accurate detection of hidden recommenders and their influence on user behavior. Unlike audit-based methods, it captures system behavior directly, without ad hoc experiments that often fail to reflect real platforms. This study provides insights into how recommenders shape behavior, aiding efforts to reduce polarization and misinformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RLDM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards A Universal Graph Structural Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10917v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large-scale pre-training have shown the potential to learn generalizable representations for downstream tasks. In the graph domain, however, capturing and transferring structural information across different graph domains remains challenging, primarily due to the inherent differences in topological patterns across various contexts. Additionally, most existing models struggle to capture the complexity of rich graph structures, leading to inadequate exploration of the embedding space. To address these challenges, we propose GFSE, a universal graph structural encoder designed to capture transferable structural patterns across diverse domains such as molecular graphs, social networks, and citation networks. GFSE is the first cross-domain graph structural encoder pre-trained with multiple self-supervised learning objectives. Built on a Graph Transformer, GFSE incorporates attention mechanisms informed by graph inductive bias, enabling it to encode intricate multi-level and fine-grained topological features. The pre-trained GFSE produces generic and theoretically expressive positional and structural encoding for graphs, which can be seamlessly integrated with various downstream graph feature encoders, including graph neural networks for vectorized features and Large Language Models for text-attributed graphs. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate GFSE's capability to significantly enhance the model's performance while requiring substantially less task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, GFSE achieves state-of-the-art performance in 81.6% evaluated cases, spanning diverse graph models and datasets, highlighting its potential as a powerful and versatile encoder for graph-structured data.</p></details> |  |

Existing GNN models focus on prediction accuracy, frequently overlooking fairness across different degree groups. To addressthis issue, we propose a novel GNN framework, namely Fairness- Aware Asymmetric Contrastive Ensemble (FairACE), which inte-grates asymmetric contrastive learning with adversarial training to improve degree fairness. FairACE captures one-hop local neighborhood information and two-hop monophily similarity to create fairer node representations and employs a degree fairness regulator to balance performance between high-degree and low-degree nodes. During model training, a novel group-balanced fairness loss is proposed to minimize classification disparities across degree groups. In addition, we also propose a novel fairness metric, the Accuracy Distribution Gap (ADG), which can quantitatively assess and ensure equitable performance across different degree-based node groups. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FairACE significantly improves degree fairness metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art GNN models.</p></details> |  |

Conventional computational methods for identifying such materials are resource-intensive and not easily scalable. Recently, universal interatomic potential models have been developed using equivariant graph neural networks. These models are trained on extensive datasets of first-principles force and energy calculations. One can achieve significant computational advantages by leveraging them as the foundation for traditional methods of assessing the ionic conductivity, such as molecular dynamics or nudged elastic band techniques. However, the generalization error from model inference on diverse atomic structures arising in such calculations can compromise the reliability of the results. In this work, we propose an approach for the quick and reliable screening of ionic conductors through the analysis of a universal interatomic potential. Our method incorporates a set of heuristic structure descriptors that effectively employ the rich knowledge of the underlying model while requiring minimal generalization capabilities. Using our descriptors, we rank lithium-containing materials in the Materials Project database according to their expected ionic conductivity. Eight out of the ten highest-ranked materials are confirmed to be superionic at room temperature in first-principles calculations. Notably, our method achieves a speed-up factor of approximately 50 compared to molecular dynamics driven by a machine-learning potential, and is at least 3,000 times faster compared to first-principles molecular dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Large...</summary><p>Larger-scale AIMD validation of our predictions; minor text updates.

These models facilitate the understanding of matter and the discovery of new molecules and materials. In contrast to GNNs operating on a large homogeneous graphs, GNNs used by CFMs process a large number of geometric graphs of varying sizes, requiring different optimization strategies than those developed for large homogeneous GNNs. This paper presents optimizations for two critical phases of CFM training: data distribution and model training, targeting MACE - a state-of-the-art CFM. We address the challenge of load balancing in data distribution by formulating it as a multi-objective bin packing problem. We propose an iterative algorithm that provides a highly effective, fast, and practical solution, ensuring efficient data distribution. For the training phase, we identify symmetric tensor contraction as the key computational kernel in MACE and optimize this kernel to improve the overall performance. Our combined approach of balanced data distribution and kernel optimization significantly enhances the training process of MACE. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial speedup, reducing per-epoch execution time for training from 12 to 2 minutes on 740 GPUs with a 2.6M sample dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 34th ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC 2025)</p></details> |

The success of these models can be attributed to their ability to effectively learn latent representations of atomic structures directly from the training data. Conversely, this also results in high data requirements for these models, hindering their application to problems which are data sparse which are common in this domain. To address this limitation, there is a growing development in the area of pre-trained machine learning models which have learned general, fundamental, geometric relationships in atomistic data, and which can then be fine-tuned to much smaller application-specific datasets. In particular, models which are pre-trained on diverse, large-scale atomistic datasets have shown impressive generalizability and flexibility to downstream applications, and are increasingly referred to as atomistic foundation models. To leverage the untapped potential of these foundation models, we introduce MatterTune, a modular and extensible framework that provides advanced fine-tuning capabilities and seamless integration of atomistic foundation models into downstream materials informatics and simulation workflows, thereby lowering the barriers to adoption and facilitating diverse applications in materials science. In its current state, MatterTune supports a number of state-of-the-art foundation models such as ORB, MatterSim, JMP, and EquformerV2, and hosts a wide range of features including a modular and flexible design, distributed and customizable fine-tuning, broad support for downstream informatics tasks, and more.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the effect of using different coarse-grained graph resolutions, obtained through the Laplacian renormalization group theory, on node classification tasks. At the theory's core is grouping nodes connected by significant information flow at a given time scale. Representations of the graph at different scales encode interaction information at different ranges. We specifically experiment using representations at the characteristic scale of the graph's mesoscopic structures. We provide the models with the original graph and the graph represented at the characteristic resolution scale and compare them to models that can only access the original graph. Our results showed that models with access to both the original graph and the characteristic scale graph can achieve statistically significant improvements in test accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face three main challenges: 1) Insufficient use of topological patterns in circuit graphs reduces prediction accuracy; 2) Data scarcity due to the complexity of annotations hinders model generalization; 3) Limited adaptability to various netlist formats. We propose GNN-ACLP, a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based framework featuring three innovations to tackle these challenges. First, we introduce the SEAL (Subgraphs, Embeddings, and Attributes for Link Prediction) framework and achieve port-level accuracy in circuit link prediction. Second, we propose Netlist Babel Fish, a netlist format conversion tool leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language model (LLM) to enhance the compatibility of netlist formats. Finally, we construct SpiceNetlist, a comprehensive dataset that contains 775 annotated circuits across 10 different classes of components. The experimental results demonstrate an improvement of 15.05% on the SpiceNetlist dataset and 12.01% on the Image2Net dataset over the existing approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data will be made available on request</p></details> |

While most research has centered on static graphs, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic, temporally evolving graphs, motivating the need for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph (CTDG) models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of Graph Representation Learning (GRL) on CTDGs with a focus on Self-Supervised Representation Learning (SSRL). We introduce a novel theoretical framework that analyzes the expressivity of CTDG models through an Information-Flow (IF) lens, quantifying their ability to propagate and encode temporal and structural information. Leveraging this framework, we categorize existing CTDG methods based on their suitability for different graph types and application scenarios. Within the same scope, we examine the design of SSRL methods tailored to CTDGs, such as predictive and contrastive approaches, highlighting their potential to mitigate the reliance on labeled data. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical insights, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of various methods across long-range, bi-partite and community-based graphs. This work offers both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for selecting and developing CTDG models, advancing the understanding of GRL in dynamic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR.

However, we find that most social media posts, along with the public sentiment they reflect, provide limited value for trading predictions due to their noisy nature. To tackle this, we propose a novel dynamic expert tracing algorithm that filters out non-informative posts and identifies both true and inverse experts whose consistent predictions can serve as valuable trading signals. Our approach achieves significant improvements over existing expert identification methods in stock trend prediction. However, when using binary expert predictions to predict the return ratio, similar to all other expert identification methods, our approach faces a common challenge of signal sparsity with expert signals cover only about 4% of all stock-day combinations in our dataset. To address this challenge, we propose a dual graph attention neural network that effectively propagates expert signals across related stocks, enabling accurate prediction of return ratios and significantly increasing signal coverage. Empirical results show that our propagated expert-based signals not only exhibit strong predictive power independently but also work synergistically with traditional financial features. These combined signals significantly outperform representative baseline models in all quant-related metrics including predictive accuracy, return metrics, and correlation metrics, resulting in more robust investment strategies. We hope this work inspires further research into leveraging social media data for enhancing quantitative investment strategies.

Among its approaches, subgraph-FL has become the dominant paradigm, with most work focused on improving overall node classification accuracy. However, these methods often overlook fairness due to the complexity of node features, labels, and graph structures. In particular, they perform poorly on nodes with disadvantaged properties, such as being in the minority class within subgraphs or having heterophilous connections (neighbors with dissimilar labels or misleading features). This reveals a critical issue: high accuracy can mask degraded performance on structurally or semantically marginalized nodes. To address this, we advocate for two fairness goals: (1) improving representation of minority class nodes for class-wise fairness and (2) mitigating topological bias from heterophilous connections for topology-aware fairness. We propose FairFGL, a novel framework that enhances fairness through fine-grained graph mining and collaborative learning. On the client side, the History-Preserving Module prevents overfitting to dominant local classes, while the Majority Alignment Module refines representations of heterophilous majority-class nodes. The Gradient Modification Module transfers minority-class knowledge from structurally favorable clients to improve fairness. On the server side, FairFGL uploads only the most influenced subset of parameters to reduce communication costs and better reflect local distributions. A cluster-based aggregation strategy reconciles conflicting updates and curbs global majority dominance . Extensive evaluations on eight benchmarks show FairFGL significantly improves minority-group performance , achieving up to a 22.62 percent Macro-F1 gain while enhancing convergence over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | Under Review |

The problem is framed as a constrained statistical learning task, where each network node operates using only local information. Opportunistic routing exploits the broadcast nature of wireless communication to dynamically select optimal forwarding nodes, enabling the information to reach the destination through multiple relay nodes simultaneously. To solve this, we propose a State-Augmentation (SA) based distributed optimization approach aimed at maximizing the total information handled by the source nodes in the network. The problem formulation leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which perform graph convolutions based on the topological connections between network nodes. Using an unsupervised learning paradigm, we extract routing policies from the GNN architecture, enabling optimal decisions for source nodes across various flows. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance when training a GNN-parameterized model, particularly when compared to baseline algorithms. Additionally, applying the method to real-world network topologies and wireless ad-hoc network test beds validates its effectiveness, highlighting the robustness and transferability of GNNs.</p></details> |  |

This variability necessitates the deployment of advanced computational methods to integrate and interpret these diverse datasets within a cohesive analytical framework. In our research, we amalgamate functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural MRI into a cohesive framework. This integration capitalizes on the unique strengths of each modality and their inherent interconnections, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the brain's connectivity and anatomical characteristics. Utilizing the Glasser atlas for parcellation, we integrate imaging derived features from various modalities: functional connectivity from fMRI, structural connectivity from DTI, and anatomical features from sMRI within consistent regions. Our approach incorporates a masking strategy to differentially weight neural connections, thereby facilitating a holistic amalgamation of multimodal imaging data. This technique enhances interpretability at connectivity level, transcending traditional analyses centered on singular regional attributes. The model is applied to the Human Connectome Project's Development study to elucidate the associations between multimodal imaging and cognitive functions throughout youth. The analysis demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and uncovers crucial anatomical features and essential neural connections, deepening our understanding of brain structure and function.</p></details> |  |

While immune cells play a key role in IBD, accurately identifying ulcer regions in whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for characterizing these cells and exploring potential therapeutics. Multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches have advanced WSI analysis but they lack spatial context awareness.

Accurate modeling of fluoride-related health risks, such as dental fluorosis, requires spatially aware learning frameworks capable of capturing both geographic and semantic heterogeneity. In this work, we propose Spatially Directional Dual-Attention Graph Attention Network (SDD-GAT), a novel spatial graph neural network designed for fine-grained health risk prediction. SDD-GAT introduces a dual-graph architecture that disentangles geographic proximity and attribute similarity, and incorporates a directional attention mechanism that explicitly encodes spatial orientation and distance into the message passing process. To further enhance spatial coherence, we introduce a spatial smoothness regularization term that enforces consistency in predictions across neighboring locations. We evaluate SDD-GAT on a large-scale dataset covering over 50,000 fluoride monitoring samples and fluorosis records across Guizhou Province, China. Results show that SDD-GAT significantly outperforms traditional models and state-of-the-art GNNs in both regression and classification tasks, while also exhibiting improved spatial autocorrelation as measured by Moran's I. Our framework provides a generalizable foundation for spatial health risk modeling and geospatial learning under complex environmental settings.</p></details> |  |

This study addresses the intricacies of service scheduling, by jointly optimizing rider trip planning and crew scheduling for a complex dynamic mobility service. The resulting optimization problems are extremely challenging computationally for state-of-the-art methods. To address this fundamental gap, this paper introduces the Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling Problem (JRTPCSSP) and a novel solution method, called Attention and Gated GNN-Informed Column Generation (AGGNNI-CG), that hybridizes column generation and machine learning to obtain near-optimal solutions to the JRTPCSSP with real-life constraints of the application. The key idea of the machine-learning component is to dramatically reduce the number of paths to explore in the pricing problem, accelerating the most time-consuming component of the column generation. The machine learning component is a graph neural network with an attention mechanism and a gated architecture, which is particularly suited to cater for the different input sizes coming from daily operations. AGGNNI-CG has been applied to a challenging, real-world dataset from the Paratransit system of Chatham County in Georgia. It produces substantial improvements compared to the baseline column generation approach, which typically cannot produce high-quality feasible solutions in reasonable time on large-scale complex instances. AGGNNI-CG also produces significant improvements in service quality compared to the existing system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Learning-Driven Multi-Vessel Association: Fusing Multimodal Data for Maritime Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09197v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring maritime safety and optimizing traffic management in increasingly crowded and complex waterways require effective waterway monitoring. However, current methods struggle with challenges arising from multimodal data, such as dimensional disparities, mismatched target counts, vessel scale variations, occlusions, and asynchronous data streams from systems like the automatic identification system (AIS) and closed-circuit television (CCTV). Traditional multi-target association methods often struggle with these complexities, particularly in densely trafficked waterways. To overcome these issues, we propose a graph learning-driven multi-vessel association (GMvA) method tailored for maritime multimodal data fusion. By integrating AIS and CCTV data, GMvA leverages time series learning and graph neural networks to capture the spatiotemporal features of vessel trajectories effectively. To enhance feature representation, the proposed method incorporates temporal graph attention and spatiotemporal attention, effectively capturing both local and global vessel interactions. Furthermore, a multi-layer perceptron-based uncertainty fusion module computes robust similarity scores, and the Hungarian algorithm is adopted to ensure globally consistent and accurate target matching. Extensive experiments on real-world maritime datasets confirm that GMvA delivers superior accuracy and robustness in multi-target association, outperforming existing methods even in challenging scenarios with high vessel density and incomplete or unevenly distributed AIS and CCTV data.</p></details> |  |

Existing brain network analysis methods primarily focus on graph-based models that rely solely on imaging data, which may overlook important non-imaging factors and limit the model's predictive power and interpretability. In this paper, we present BrainPrompt, an innovative framework that enhances Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge-driven prompts, enabling more effective capture of complex, non-imaging information and external knowledge for neurological disease identification. BrainPrompt integrates three types of knowledge-driven prompts: (1) ROI-level prompts to encode the identity and function of each brain region, (2) subject-level prompts that incorporate demographic information, and (3) disease-level prompts to capture the temporal progression of disease. By leveraging these multi-level prompts, BrainPrompt effectively harnesses knowledge-enhanced multi-modal information from LLMs, enhancing the model's capability to predict neurological disease stages and meanwhile offers more interpretable results. We evaluate BrainPrompt on two resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets from neurological disorders, showing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a biomarker study demonstrates the framework's ability to extract valuable and interpretable information aligned with domain knowledge in neuroscience.</p></details> |  |

Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer an alternative by leveraging graph-based methodologies but are hindered by the computational bottlenecks of clustering algorithms used for edge generation. To address these issues, we propose the Hypergraph Vision Transformer (HgVT), which incorporates a hierarchical bipartite hypergraph structure into the vision transformer framework to capture higher-order semantic relationships while maintaining computational efficiency. HgVT leverages population and diversity regularization for dynamic hypergraph construction without clustering, and expert edge pooling to enhance semantic extraction and facilitate graph-based image retrieval. Empirical results demonstrate that HgVT achieves strong performance on image classification and retrieval, positioning it as an efficient framework for semantic-based vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Traditional GNNs follow a message passing scheme that can effectively utilize local and structural information. However, the phenomena of over-smoothing and over-squashing limit the receptive field in message passing processes. Graph Transformers were introduced to address these issues, achieving a global receptive field but suffering from the noise of irrelevant nodes and loss of structural information. Therefore, drawing inspiration from fine-grained token-based representation learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we propose the Structure-aware Multi-token Graph Transformer (Tokenphormer), which generates multiple tokens to effectively capture local and structural information and explore global information at different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first introduce the walk-token generated by mixed walks consisting of four walk types to explore the graph and capture structure and contextual information flexibly. To ensure local and global information coverage, we also introduce the SGPM-token (obtained through the Self-supervised Graph Pre-train Model, SGPM) and the hop-token, extending the length and density limit of the walk-token, respectively. Finally, these expressive tokens are fed into the Transformer model to learn node representations collaboratively. Experimental results demonstrate that the capability of the proposed Tokenphormer can achieve state-of-the-art performance on node classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Addressing Graph Heterogeneity and Heterophily from A Spectral Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13373v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated excellent performance in semi-supervised node classification tasks. Despite this, two primary challenges persist: heterogeneity and heterophily. Each of these two challenges can significantly hinder the performance of GNNs. Heterogeneity refers to a graph with multiple types of nodes or edges, while heterophily refers to the fact that connected nodes are more likely to have dissimilar attributes or labels. Although there have been few works studying heterogeneous heterophilic graphs, they either only consider the heterophily of specific meta-paths and lack expressiveness, or have high expressiveness but fail to exploit high-order neighbors. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Heterophilic Spectral Graph Neural Network (H2SGNN), which employs two modules: local independent filtering and global hybrid filtering. Local independent filtering adaptively learns node representations under different homophily, while global hybrid filtering exploits high-order neighbors to learn more possible meta-paths. Extensive experiments are conducted on four datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed H2SGNN, which achieves superior performance with fewer parameters and memory consumption. The code is available at the GitHub repo: https://github.com/Lukangkang123/H2SGNN/.</p></details> |  |

However, most HGP methods suffer not only from lack of considering global topology of the graph and focusing on the feature learning aspect, but also they do not align local and global features since graphs should inherently be analyzed in a multiscale way. LGRPool is proposed in the present paper as a HGP in the framework of expectation maximization in machine learning that aligns local and global aspects of message passing with each other using a regularizer to force the global topological information to be inline with the local message passing at different scales through the representations at different layers of HGP. Experimental results on some graph classification benchmarks show that it slightly outperforms some baselines.</p></details> | f tables, 2 figures |

Existing solutions for the design space exploration (DSE) adopt either heuristic methods, lacking essential information for further optimization potential, or predictive models, missing sufficient generalization due to the time-consuming nature of HLS and the exponential growth of the design space. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Inverse Design for HLS (DID4HLS), a novel approach that integrates graph neural networks and generative models. DID4HLS iteratively optimizes hardware designs aimed at compute-intensive algorithms by learning conditional distributions of design features from post-HLS data. Compared to four state-of-the-art DSE baselines, our method achieved an average improvement of 42.8% on average distance to reference set (ADRS) compared to the best-performing baselines across six benchmarks, while demonstrating high robustness and efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/PingChang818/DID4HLS.</p></details> |  |

Traditional path-planning algorithms struggle in these scenarios, particularly when prior information is not available. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and transformer-based mechanisms for enhanced multi-agent coordination and collective task execution. Our approach leverages GNNs to model agent-agent and agent-goal interactions through adaptive graph construction, enabling efficient information aggregation and decision-making under constrained communication. A transformer-based message-passing mechanism, augmented with edge-feature-enhanced attention, captures complex interaction patterns, while a Double Deep Q-Network (Double DQN) with prioritized experience replay optimizes agent policies in partially observable environments. This integration is carefully designed to address specific requirements of multi-agent navigation, such as scalability, adaptability, and efficient task execution. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance, with 90% service provisioning and 100% grid coverage (node discovery), while reducing the average steps per episode to 200, compared to 600 for benchmark methods such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), greedy algorithms and DQN.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, Accepted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)</p></details> |

Unlike traditional machine learning methods that rely solely on numerical features of transaction records, this approach constructs heterogeneous transaction graphs. These graphs incorporate multiple node types, including users, merchants, and transactions. By leveraging graph neural networks, the model captures higher-order transaction relationships. A Graph Attention Mechanism is employed to dynamically assign weights to different transaction relationships. Additionally, a Temporal Decay Mechanism is integrated to enhance the model's sensitivity to time-related fraud patterns. To address the scarcity of fraudulent transaction samples, this study applies SMOTE oversampling and Cost-sensitive Learning. These techniques strengthen the model's ability to identify fraudulent transactions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing GNN models, including GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE, on the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset. The model achieves notable improvements in both accuracy and OC-ROC. Future research may explore the integration of dynamic graph neural networks and reinforcement learning. Such advancements could enhance the real-time adaptability of fraud detection systems and provide more intelligent solutions for financial risk control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Opinion de-polarization of social networks with GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09404v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, social media is the ground for political debate and exchange of opinions. There is a significant amount of research that suggests that social media are highly polarized. A phenomenon that is commonly observed is the echo chamber structure, where users are organized in polarized communities and form connections only with similar-minded individuals, limiting themselves to consume specific content. In this paper we explore a way to decrease the polarization of networks with two echo chambers. Particularly, we observe that if some users adopt a moderate opinion about a topic, the polarization of the network decreases. Based on this observation, we propose an efficient algorithm to identify a good set of K users, such that if they adopt a moderate stance around a topic, the polarization is minimized. Our algorithm employs a Graph Neural Network and thus it can handle large graphs more effectively than other approaches</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Laws of Graph Neural Networks for Atomistic Materials Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08112v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Atomistic materials modeling is a critical task with wide-ranging applications, from drug discovery to materials science, where accurate predictions of the target material property can lead to significant advancements in scientific discovery. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) represent the state-of-the-art approach for modeling atomistic material data thanks to their capacity to capture complex relational structures. While machine learning performance has historically improved with larger models and datasets, GNNs for atomistic materials modeling remain relatively small compared to large language models (LLMs), which leverage billions of parameters and terabyte-scale datasets to achieve remarkable performance in their respective domains. To address this gap, we explore the scaling limits of GNNs for atomistic materials modeling by developing a foundational model with billions of parameters, trained on extensive datasets in terabyte-scale. Our approach incorporates techniques from LLM libraries to efficiently manage large-scale data and models, enabling both effective training and deployment of these large-scale GNN models. This work addresses three fundamental questions in scaling GNNs: the potential for scaling GNN model architectures, the effect of dataset size on model accuracy, and the applicability of LLM-inspired techniques to GNN architectures. Specifically, the outcomes of this study include (1) insights into the scaling laws for GNNs, highlighting the relationship between model size, dataset volume, and accuracy, (2) a foundational GNN model optimized for atomistic materials modeling, and (3) a GNN codebase enhanced with advanced LLM-based training techniques. Our findings lay the groundwork for large-scale GNNs with billions of parameters and terabyte-scale datasets, establishing a scalable pathway for future advancements in atomistic materials modeling.</p></details> | Accepted by DAC'25 |

| **[Multi-view Hybrid Graph Convolutional Network for Volume-to-mesh Reconstruction in Cardiovascular MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13706v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is emerging as a crucial tool to examine cardiac morphology and function. Essential to this endeavour are anatomical 3D surface and volumetric meshes derived from CMR images, which facilitate computational anatomy studies, biomarker discovery, and in-silico simulations. Traditional approaches typically follow complex multi-step pipelines, first segmenting images and then reconstructing meshes, making them time-consuming and prone to error propagation. In response, we introduce HybridVNet, a novel architecture for direct image-to-mesh extraction seamlessly integrating standard convolutional neural networks with graph convolutions, which we prove can efficiently handle surface and volumetric meshes by encoding them as graph structures. To further enhance accuracy, we propose a multi-view HybridVNet architecture which processes both long axis and short axis CMR, showing that it can increase the performance of cardiac MR mesh generation. Our model combines traditional convolutional networks with variational graph generative models, deep supervision and mesh-specific regularisation. Experiments on a comprehensive dataset from the UK Biobank confirm the potential of HybridVNet to significantly advance cardiac imaging and computational cardiology by efficiently generating high-fidelity meshes from CMR images. Multi-view HybridVNet outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements of up to $\sim$27\% reduction in Mean Contour Distance (from 1.86 mm to 1.35 mm for the LV Myocardium), up to $\sim$18\% improvement in Hausdorff distance (from 4.74 mm to 3.89mm, for the LV Endocardium), and up to $\sim$8\% in Dice Coefficient (from 0.78 to 0.84, for the LV Myocardium), highlighting its superior accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in spatial feature extraction, they often neglect inter-image relational dependencies, leading to misclassifications. This paper proposes an interpretable hybrid Sequential CNN-Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that synergizes MobileNetV2 for localized feature extraction and GraphSAGE for relational modeling. The framework constructs a graph where nodes represent leaf images, with edges defined by cosine similarity-based adjacency matrices and adaptive neighborhood sampling. This design captures fine-grained lesion features and global symptom patterns, addressing inter-class similarity challenges. Cross-modal interpretability is achieved via Grad-CAM and Eigen-CAM visualizations, generating heatmaps to highlight disease-influential regions. Evaluated on a dataset of ten soybean leaf diseases, the model achieves $97.16\%$ accuracy, surpassing standalone CNNs ($\le95.04\%$) and traditional machine learning models ($\le77.05\%$). Ablation studies validate the sequential architecture's superiority over parallel or single-model configurations. With only 2.3 million parameters, the lightweight MobileNetV2-GraphSAGE combination ensures computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. The proposed approach bridges the gap between accurate classification and practical applicability, offering a robust, interpretable tool for agricultural diagnostics while advancing CNN-GNN integration in plant pathology research.</p></details> |  |

In addition, suitable invariant input and output spaces are derived that allow the GNN models to be embedded seamlessly into the LES framework to obtain a symmetry-preserving simulation setup. The suitability of the proposed approach is investigated for two canonical test cases: Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (HIT) and turbulent channel flow. For both cases, GNN models are trained successfully in actual simulations using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to ensure that the models are consistent with the underlying LES formulation and discretization. It is demonstrated for the HIT case that the resulting GNN-based LES scheme recovers rotational and reflectional equivariance up to machine precision in actual simulations. At the same time, the stability and accuracy remain on par with non-symmetry-preserving machine learning models that fail to obey these properties. The same modeling strategy translates well to turbulent channel flow, where the GNN model successfully learns the more complex flow physics and is able to recover the turbulent statistics and Reynolds stresses. It is shown that the GNN model learns a zonal modeling strategy with distinct behaviors in the near-wall and outer regions. The proposed approach thus demonstrates the potential of GNNs for turbulence modeling, especially in the context of LES and RL.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

One of the most effective techniques to detect OOD nodes is to expose the detector model with an additional OOD node-set, yet the extra OOD instances are often difficult to obtain in practice. Recent methods for image data address this problem using OOD data synthesis, typically relying on pre-trained generative models like Stable Diffusion. However, these approaches require vast amounts of additional data, as well as one-for-all pre-trained generative models, which are not available for graph data. Therefore, we propose the GOLD framework for graph OOD detection, an implicit adversarial learning pipeline with synthetic OOD exposure without pre-trained models. The implicit adversarial training process employs a novel alternating optimisation framework by training: (1) a latent generative model to regularly imitate the in-distribution (ID) embeddings from an evolving GNN, and (2) a GNN encoder and an OOD detector to accurately classify ID data while increasing the energy divergence between the ID embeddings and the generative model's synthetic embeddings. This novel approach implicitly transforms the synthetic embeddings into pseudo-OOD instances relative to the ID data, effectively simulating exposure to OOD scenarios without auxiliary data. Extensive OOD detection experiments are conducted on five benchmark graph datasets, verifying the superior performance of GOLD without using real OOD data compared with the state-of-the-art OOD exposure and non-exposure baselines.</p></details> | ICLR25 |

The heterogeneous graph network of shops and corridor paths are obtained from floorplans of the malls by creating vector layers for corridors, shops and entrances. These are subsequently assimilated into nodes and edges of graphs. The prediction of the usage probability is based on the shop features, namely, the area and usage categories they fall into, and on the graph connecting these shops, corridor junctions and entrances by corridor paths. Though the presented method is applicable for training on datasets obtained from a field survey or from pedestrian-detecting sensors, the target data of the supervised deep-learning work flow in this work are obtained from a probability method. We also include a context-specific representation learning of latent features. The usage-probability prediction is made on each edge, which is a connection by a section of corridor path between the adjacent nodes representing the shops or corridor points. To create a feature for each edge, the hidden-layer feature vectors acquired in the message-passing GNN layers at the nodes of each edge are averaged and concatenated with the vector obtained by their multiplication. These edge-features are then passed to multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to make the final prediction of usage probability on each edge. The samples of synthetic learning dataset for each shopping mall are obtained by changing the shops' usage and area categories, and by subsequently feeding the graph into the probability model. When including different shopping malls in a single dataset, we also propose to consider graph-level features to inform the model with specific identifying features of each mall.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, working manuscript with partial results</p></details> |

Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets and established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with respect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most comprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the honey bee (Apis mellifera), an ecologically vital pollinator. We evaluate ApisTox using a diverse suite of machine learning approaches, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as well as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical space. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as ApisTox, demonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art algorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for more diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the agrochemical domain.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based methods have made significant progress in the field of Android malware detection. However, traditional detection methods based on static features struggle to identify obfuscated malicious code, while methods relying on dynamic analysis suffer from low efficiency. To address this, we propose a dynamic weighted feature selection method that analyzes the importance and stability of features, calculates scores to filter out the most robust features, and combines these selected features with the program's structural information. We then utilize graph neural networks for classification, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of the detection system. We analyzed 8,664 malware samples from eight malware families and tested a total of 44,940 malware variants generated using seven obfuscation strategies. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves an F1-score of 95.56% on the unobfuscated dataset and 92.28% on the obfuscated dataset, indicating that the model can effectively detect obfuscated malware.</p></details> | 15 pages, 1 figure |

A core desideratum is that explanations are \textit{faithful}, \ie that they portray an accurate picture of the GNN's reasoning process. However, a number of different faithfulness metrics exist, begging the question of what is faithfulness exactly and how to achieve it. We make three key contributions. We begin by showing that \textit{existing metrics are not interchangeable} -- \ie explanations attaining high faithfulness according to one metric may be unfaithful according to others -- and can systematically ignore important properties of explanations. We proceed to show that, surprisingly, \textit{optimizing for faithfulness is not always a sensible design goal}. Specifically, we prove that for injective regular GNN architectures, perfectly faithful explanations are completely uninformative. This does not apply to modular GNNs, such as self-explainable and domain-invariant architectures, prompting us to study the relationship between architectural choices and faithfulness. Finally, we show that \textit{faithfulness is tightly linked to out-of-distribution generalization}, in that simply ensuring that a GNN can correctly recognize the domain-invariant subgraph, as prescribed by the literature, does not guarantee that it is invariant unless this subgraph is also faithful.The code is publicly available on GitHub</p></details> | <details><summary>Uploa...</summary><p>Uploading ICLR25 camera ready version</p></details> |
| **[Towards Scalable and Deep Graph Neural Networks via Noise Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14602v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in many graph mining tasks. However, scaling them to large graphs is challenging due to the high computational and storage costs of repeated feature propagation and non-linear transformation during training. One commonly employed approach to address this challenge is model-simplification, which only executes the Propagation (P) once in the pre-processing, and Combine (C) these receptive fields in different ways and then feed them into a simple model for better performance. Despite their high predictive performance and scalability, these methods still face two limitations. First, existing approaches mainly focus on exploring different C methods from the model perspective, neglecting the crucial problem of performance degradation with increasing P depth from the data-centric perspective, known as the over-smoothing problem. Second, pre-processing overhead takes up most of the end-to-end processing time, especially for large-scale graphs. To address these limitations, we present random walk with noise masking (RMask), a plug-and-play module compatible with the existing model-simplification works. This module enables the exploration of deeper GNNs while preserving their scalability. Unlike the previous model-simplification works, we focus on continuous P and found that the noise existing inside each P is the cause of the over-smoothing issue, and use the efficient masking mechanism to eliminate them. Experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that model-simplification works equipped with RMask yield superior performance compared to their original version and can make a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, incorporating long histories is resource-intensive. Hence, temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) often rely on historical neighbors sampling heuristics such as uniform sampling or recent neighbors selection. These heuristics are static and fail to adapt to the underlying graph structure. We introduce FLASH, a learnable and graph-adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that generalizes existing heuristics. FLASH integrates seamlessly into TGNNs and is trained end-to-end using a self-supervised ranking loss. We provide theoretical evidence that commonly used heuristics hinders TGNNs performance, motivating our design. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent and significant performance improvements for TGNNs equipped with FLASH.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). Where previous works relied on semi-local functionals or fixed-size descriptors of the density, we compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud for efficient non-local atomic-range interactions. By applying an equivariant GNN on this point cloud, we capture molecular-range interactions in a scalable and accurate manner. To train EG-XC, we differentiate through a self-consistent field solver requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Representation Learning, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Convolutional Neural Network and Graph Neural Network based Surrogate Models on a Real-World Car External Aerodynamics Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06699v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerodynamic optimization is crucial for developing eco-friendly, aerodynamic, and stylish cars, which requires close collaboration between aerodynamicists and stylists, a collaboration impaired by the time-consuming nature of aerodynamic simulations. Surrogate models offer a viable solution to reduce this overhead, but they are untested in real-world aerodynamic datasets. We present a comparative evaluation of two surrogate modeling approaches for predicting drag on a real-world dataset: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that uses a signed distance field as input and a commercial tool based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that directly processes a surface mesh. In contrast to previous studies based on datasets created from parameterized geometries, our dataset comprises 343 geometries derived from 32 baseline vehicle geometries across five distinct car projects, reflecting the diverse, free-form modifications encountered in the typical vehicle development process. Our results show that the CNN-based method achieves a mean absolute error of 2.3 drag counts, while the GNN-based method achieves 3.8. Both methods achieve approximately 77% accuracy in predicting the direction of drag change relative to the baseline geometry. While both methods effectively capture the broader trends between baseline groups (set of samples derived from a single baseline geometry), they struggle to varying extents in capturing the finer intra-baseline group variations. In summary, our findings suggest that aerodynamicists can effectively use both methods to predict drag in under two minutes, which is at least 600 times faster than performing a simulation. However, there remains room for improvement in capturing the finer details of the geometry.</p></details> |  |

The deep learning network for this task relies on historical data inputs, yet real-time data can be corrupted by sensor noise, altering its distribution. We model this noise as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise and incorporate it into the LargeST traffic volume dataset, resulting in data with both inherent and additive noise components. Our approach involves decomposing the corrupted signal into modes using variational mode decomposition, followed by feeding the data into a learning pipeline for prediction. We integrate a 3D attention mechanism encompassing spatial, temporal, and channel attention. The spatial and temporal attention modules learn their respective correlations, while the channel attention mechanism is used to suppress noise and highlight the significant modes in the spatiotemporal signals. Additionally, a learnable soft thresholding method is implemented to exclude unimportant modes from the feature vector, and a feature reduction method based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is applied. We compare the performance of our approach against baseline models, demonstrating that our method achieves superior long-term prediction accuracy, robustness to noise, and improved performance with mode truncation compared to the baseline models.

However, recent studies reveal that GNNs often fail to outperform simple MLPs on heterophilous graph tasks, where connected nodes may differ in features or labels, challenging the homophily assumption. Existing methods addressing this issue often overlook the importance of information granularity and rarely consider implicit relationships between distant nodes. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Granular and Implicit Graph Network (GRAIN), a novel GNN model specifically designed for heterophilous graphs. GRAIN enhances node embeddings by aggregating multi-view information at various granularity levels and incorporating implicit data from distant, non-neighboring nodes. This approach effectively integrates local and global information, resulting in smoother, more accurate node representations. We also introduce an adaptive graph information aggregator that efficiently combines multi-granularity and implicit data, significantly improving node representation quality, as shown by experiments on 13 datasets covering varying homophily and heterophily. GRAIN consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art models, excelling on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing attempts of heterophilous GNNs incorporate long-range or global aggregations to distinguish nodes in the graph. However, these aggregations usually require iteratively maintaining and updating full-graph information, which limits their efficiency when applying to large-scale graphs. In this paper, we propose SIGMA, an efficient global heterophilous GNN aggregation integrating the structural similarity measurement SimRank. Our theoretical analysis illustrates that SIGMA inherently captures distant global similarity even under heterophily, that conventional approaches can only achieve after iterative aggregations. Furthermore, it enjoys efficient one-time computation with a complexity only linear to the node set size $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SIGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior aggregation and overall efficiency. Notably, it obtains $5\times$ acceleration on the large-scale heterophily dataset pokec with over 30 million edges compared to the best baseline aggregation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Acceptted to ICDE 2025</p></details> |

In particular, we are interested in learning distributed optimal controllers using graph recurrent neural networks (GRNNs). Most of the existing approaches result in centralized optimal controllers with offline training processes. However, as the increasing demand of network resilience, the optimal controllers are further expected to be distributed, and are desirable to be trained in an online distributed fashion, which are also the main contributions of our work. To solve this problem, we first propose a GRNN-based distributed optimal control method, and we cast the problem as a self-supervised learning problem. Then, the distributed online training is achieved via distributed gradient computation, and inspired by the (consensus-based) distributed optimization idea, a distributed online training optimizer is designed. Furthermore, the local closed-loop stability of the linear networked system under our proposed GRNN-based controller is provided by assuming that the nonlinear activation function of the GRNN-based controller is both local sector-bounded and slope-restricted. The effectiveness of our proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations using a specifically developed simulator.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

Existing methods like low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are efficient but lack flexibility, while Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enhance model capacity at the cost of more & under-utilized parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Structural Mixture of Residual Experts (S'MoRE), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the efficiency of LoRA with the flexibility of MoE. Specifically, S'MoRE employs hierarchical low-rank decomposition of expert weights, yielding residuals of varying orders interconnected in a multi-layer structure. By routing input tokens through sub-trees of residuals, S'MoRE emulates the capacity of many experts by instantiating and assembling just a few low-rank matrices. We craft the inter-layer propagation of S'MoRE's residuals as a special type of Graph Neural Network (GNN), and prove that under similar parameter budget, S'MoRE improves "structural flexibility" of traditional MoE (or Mixture-of-LoRA) by exponential order. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that S'MoRE achieves superior fine-tuning performance, offering a transformative approach for efficient LLM adaptation.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heuristic Methods are Good Teachers to Distill MLPs for Graph Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06193v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction is a crucial graph-learning task with applications including citation prediction and product recommendation. Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.</p></details> |  |

Typically, reduction approaches either remove edges (sparsification) or merge nodes (coarsening) in an unsupervised way with no specific downstream task in mind. In this paper, we present an approach for subsampling graph structures using an Ising model defined on either the nodes or edges and learning the external magnetic field of the Ising model using a graph neural network. Our approach is task-specific as it can learn how to reduce a graph for a specific downstream task in an end-to-end fashion without requiring a differentiable loss function for the task. We showcase the versatility of our approach on four distinct applications: image segmentation, explainability for graph classification, 3D shape sparsification, and sparse approximate matrix inverse determination.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 22 figures, accepted at the Learning on Graphs conference (LoG 2024)</p></details> |

Traditional metaheuristics excel at exploring complex solution spaces efficiently, yet they often struggle with scalability. Deep learning has become a viable alternative for quickly generating high-quality solutions, particularly when metaheuristics underperform. In recent years, quantum-inspired approaches such as tensor networks have shown promise in addressing these challenges. Despite these advancements, a thorough comparison of the different paradigms is missing. This study evaluates eight algorithms on Weighted Max-Cut graphs ranging from 10 to 250 nodes. Specifically, we compare a Genetic Algorithm representing metaheuristics, a Graph Neural Network for deep learning, and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group as a tensor network approach. Our analysis focuses on solution quality and computational efficiency (i.e., time and memory usage). Numerical results show that the Genetic Algorithm achieves near-optimal results for small graphs, although its computation time grows significantly with problem size. The Graph Neural Network offers a balanced solution for medium-sized instances with low memory demands and rapid inference, yet it exhibits more significant variability on larger graphs. Meanwhile, the Tensor Network approach consistently yields high approximation ratios and efficient execution on larger graphs, albeit with increased memory consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, paper Submitted to GECCO '25</p></details> |
| **[Graph Federated Learning Based Proactive Content Caching in Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04760v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of mobile data traffic and the increasing prevalence of video streaming, proactive content caching in edge computing has become crucial for reducing latency and alleviating network congestion. However, traditional caching strategies such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU fail to effectively predict future content popularity, while existing proactive caching approaches often require users to upload data to a central server, raising concerns regarding privacy and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph Federated Learning-based Proactive Content Caching (GFPCC) scheme that enhances caching efficiency while preserving user privacy. The proposed approach integrates federated learning and graph neural networks, enabling users to locally train Light Graph Convolutional Networks (LightGCN) to capture user-item relationships and predict content popularity. Instead of sharing raw data, only the trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server, where a federated averaging algorithm aggregates updates, refines the global model, and selects the most popular files for proactive caching. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, such as MovieLens, demonstrate that GFPCC outperforms baseline caching algorithms by achieving higher cache efficiency through more accurate content popularity predictions. Moreover, the federated learning framework strengthens privacy protection while maintaining efficient model training; however, scalability remains a challenge in large-scale networks with dynamic user preferences.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in autonomous driving, traditional pipelines rely on deterministic models that fail to capture the probabilistic nature and inherent uncertainty of real-world driving. To address this, we propose PRIMEDrive-CoT, a novel uncertainty-aware model for object interaction and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in driving scenarios. In particular, our approach combines LiDAR-based 3D object detection with multi-view RGB references to ensure interpretable and reliable scene understanding. Uncertainty and risk assessment, along with object interactions, are modelled using Bayesian Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs) for probabilistic reasoning under ambiguous conditions. Interpretable decisions are facilitated through CoT reasoning, leveraging object dynamics and contextual cues, while Grad-CAM visualizations highlight attention regions. Extensive evaluations on the DriveCoT dataset demonstrate that PRIMEDrive-CoT outperforms state-of-the-art CoT and risk-aware models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025 - CVPRW</p></details> |
| **[On the Hölder Stability of Multiset and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06984v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive research efforts have been put into characterizing and constructing maximally separating multiset and graph neural networks. However, recent empirical evidence suggests the notion of separation itself doesn't capture several interesting phenomena. On the one hand, the quality of this separation may be very weak, to the extent that the embeddings of "separable" objects might even be considered identical when using fixed finite precision. On the other hand, architectures which aren't capable of separation in theory, somehow achieve separation when taking the network to be wide enough. In this work, we address both of these issues, by proposing a novel pair-wise separation quality analysis framework which is based on an adaptation of Lipschitz and \Holder{} stability to parametric functions. The proposed framework, which we name \emph{\Holder{} in expectation}, allows for separation quality analysis, without restricting the analysis to embeddings that can separate all the input space simultaneously. We prove that common sum-based models are lower-\Holder{} in expectation, with an exponent that decays rapidly with the network's depth . Our analysis leads to adversarial examples of graphs which can be separated by three 1-WL iterations, but cannot be separated in practice by standard maximally powerful Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). To remedy this, we propose two novel MPNNs with improved separation quality, one of which is lower Lipschitz in expectation. We show these MPNNs can easily classify our adversarial examples, and compare favorably with standard MPNNs on standard graph learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results by modeling molecules as molecular graphs, their reliance on data-driven learning limits their ability to generalize, particularly in the presence of data imbalance and diverse molecular substructures. Existing methods often overlook the varying contributions of different substructures to molecular properties, treating them uniformly. To address these challenges, we propose ASE-Mol, a novel GNN-based framework that leverages a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for molecular property prediction. ASE-Mol incorporates BRICS decomposition and significant substructure awareness to dynamically identify positive and negative substructures. By integrating a MoE architecture, it reduces the adverse impact of negative motifs while improving adaptability to positive motifs. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASE-Mol achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in both accuracy and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural networks excel at learning graph data, the omnipresent non-Euclidean structure, but often lack the generalization capacity. Hence, graph foundation model is drawing increasing attention, and recent efforts have been made to leverage Large Language Models. On the one hand, existing studies primarily focus on text-attributed graphs, while a wider range of real graphs do not contain fruitful textual attributes. On the other hand, the sequential graph description tailored for the Large Language Model neglects the structural complexity, which is a predominant characteristic of the graph. Such limitations motivate an important question: Can we go beyond Large Language Models, and pretrain a universal model to learn the structural knowledge for any graph? The answer in the language or vision domain is a shared vocabulary. We observe the fact that there also exist shared substructures underlying graph domain, and thereby open a new opportunity of graph foundation model with structural vocabulary. The key innovation is the discovery of a simple yet effective structural vocabulary of trees and cycles, and we explore its inherent connection to Riemannian geometry. Herein, we present a universal pretraining model, RiemannGFM. Concretely, we first construct a novel product bundle to incorporate the diverse geometries of the vocabulary. Then, on this constructed space, we stack Riemannian layers where the structural vocabulary, regardless of specific graph, is learned in Riemannian manifold offering cross-domain transferability. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of RiemannGFM on a diversity of real graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |

Recent explainability methods have focused on attention, gradient, and Shapley value. These do not handle data with strong associated prior knowledge and fail to constrain explainability results based on known relationships between predictive features. We propose GraphPINE, a graph neural network (GNN) architecture leveraging domain-specific prior knowledge to initialize node importance optimized during training for drug response prediction. Typically, a manual post-prediction step examines literature (i.e., prior knowledge) to understand returned predictive features. While node importance can be obtained for gradient and attention after prediction, node importance from these methods lacks complementary prior knowledge; GraphPINE seeks to overcome this limitation. GraphPINE differs from other GNN gating methods by utilizing an LSTM-like sequential format. We introduce an importance propagation layer that unifies 1) updates for feature matrix and node importance and 2) uses GNN-based graph propagation of feature values. This initialization and updating mechanism allows for informed feature learning and improved graph representation. We apply GraphPINE to cancer drug response prediction using drug screening and gene data collected for over 5,000 gene nodes included in a gene-gene graph with a drug-target interaction (DTI) graph for initial importance. The gene-gene graph and DTIs were obtained from curated sources and weighted by article count discussing relationships between drugs and genes. GraphPINE achieves a PR-AUC of 0.894 and ROC-AUC of 0.796 across 952 drugs. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GraphPINE-40DE.</p></details> |  |

DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations to make code amenable to safe, accurate, and efficient graph execution. We present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in specifying whether their otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL code could be reliably and efficiently executed as graphs while preserving semantics. The approach, based on a novel imperative tensor analysis, automatically determines when it is safe and potentially advantageous to migrate imperative DL code to graph execution. The approach is implemented as a PyDev Eclipse IDE plug-in that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and evaluated on 19 Python projects consisting of 132.05 KLOC. We found that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Approach to Linking Histology Images with DNA Methylation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05403v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression by adding methyl groups to DNA. Abnormal methylation patterns can disrupt gene expression and have been linked to cancer development. To quantify DNA methylation, specialized assays are typically used. However, these assays are often costly and have lengthy processing times, which limits their widespread availability in routine clinical practice. In contrast, whole slide images (WSIs) for the majority of cancer patients can be more readily available. As such, given the ready availability of WSIs, there is a compelling need to explore the potential relationship between WSIs and DNA methylation patterns. To address this, we propose an end-to-end graph neural network based weakly supervised learning framework to predict the methylation state of gene groups exhibiting coherent patterns across samples. Using data from three cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - TCGA-LGG (Brain Lower Grade Glioma), TCGA-GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) ($n$=729) and TCGA-KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma) ($n$=511) - we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher AUROC scores than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, by more than $20\%$. We conduct gene set enrichment analyses on the gene groups and show that majority of the gene groups are significantly enriched in important hallmarks and pathways. We also generate spatially enriched heatmaps to further investigate links between histological patterns and DNA methylation states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores association of spatially resolved histological patterns with gene group methylation states across multiple cancer types using weakly supervised deep learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Coarse-Grained Dynamics on Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09324v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a Graph Neural Network (GNN) non-Markovian modeling framework to identify coarse-grained dynamical systems on graphs. Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.</p></details> | 43 pages, 12 figures |

Traditional compartmental models often struggle to estimate temporally and spatially varying epidemiological parameters, while deep learning models typically overlook disease transmission dynamics and lack interpretability in the epidemiological context. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Causal Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (CSTGNN), a hybrid framework that integrates a Spatio-Contact SIR model with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of epidemics. Inter-regional human mobility exhibits continuous and smooth spatiotemporal patterns, leading to adjacent graph structures that share underlying mobility dynamics. To model these dynamics, we employ an adaptive static connectivity graph to represent the stable components of human mobility and utilize a temporal dynamics model to capture fluctuations within these patterns. By integrating the adaptive static connectivity graph with the temporal dynamics graph, we construct a dynamic graph that encapsulates the comprehensive properties of human mobility networks. Additionally, to capture temporal trends and variations in infectious disease spread, we introduce a temporal decomposition model to handle temporal dependence. This model is then integrated with a dynamic graph convolutional network for epidemic forecasting. We validate our model using real-world datasets at the provincial level in China and the state level in Germany. Extensive studies demonstrate that our method effectively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases, providing a valuable tool for forecasting and intervention strategies. Furthermore, analysis of the learned parameters offers insights into disease transmission mechanisms, enhancing the interpretability and practical applicability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 12 figures.

Current computational methods for modeling these relationships face three major challenges: (1) the failure to model asymmetric relationships, e.g., one individual may perceive the other as a friend while the other perceives them as an acquaintance, (2) the disruption of continuous interactions by discrete frame sampling, which segments the temporal continuity of interaction in real-world scenarios, and (3) the limitation to consider periodic behavioral cues, such as rhythmic vocalizations or recurrent gestures, which are crucial for inferring the evolution of dyadic relationships. To address these challenges, we propose AsyReC, a multimodal graph-based framework for asymmetric dyadic relationship classification, with three core innovations: (i) a triplet graph neural network with node-edge dual attention that dynamically weights multimodal cues to capture interaction asymmetries (addressing challenge 1); (ii) a clip-level relationship learning architecture that preserves temporal continuity, enabling fine-grained modeling of real-world interaction dynamics (addressing challenge 2); and (iii) a periodic temporal encoder that projects time indices onto sine/cosine waveforms to model recurrent behavioral patterns (addressing challenge 3). Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, while ablation studies validate the critical role of asymmetric interaction modeling and periodic temporal encoding in improving the robustness of dyadic relationship classification in real-world scenarios. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tw-repository/AsyReC.</p></details> |  |
| **[STREAK: Streaming Network for Continual Learning of Object Relocations under Household Context Drifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05549v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world settings, robots are expected to assist humans across diverse tasks and still continuously adapt to dynamic changes over time. For example, in domestic environments, robots can proactively help users by fetching needed objects based on learned routines, which they infer by observing how objects move over time. However, data from these interactions are inherently non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.), e.g., a robot assisting multiple users may encounter varying data distributions as individuals follow distinct habits. This creates a challenge: integrating new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose STREAK (Spatio Temporal RElocation with Adaptive Knowledge retention), a continual learning framework for real-world robotic learning. It leverages a streaming graph neural network with regularization and rehearsal techniques to mitigate context drifts while retaining past knowledge. Our method is time- and memory-efficient, enabling long-term learning without retraining on all past data, which becomes infeasible as data grows in real-world interactions. We evaluate STREAK on the task of incrementally predicting human routines over 50+ days across different households. Results show that it effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting while maintaining generalization, making it a scalable solution for long-term human-robot interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextualized Messages Boost Graph Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12529v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to process data that may be represented as graphs. This has prompted several studies to explore their representational capability based on the graph isomorphism task. Notably, these works inherently assume a countable node feature representation, potentially limiting their applicability. Interestingly, only a few study GNNs with uncountable node feature representation. In the paper, a new perspective on the representational capability of GNNs is investigated across all levels$\unicode{x2014}$node-level, neighborhood-level, and graph-level$\unicode{x2014}$when the space of node feature representation is uncountable. Specifically, the injective and metric requirements of previous works are softly relaxed by employing a pseudometric distance on the space of input to create a soft-injective function such that distinct inputs may produce similar outputs if and only if the pseudometric deems the inputs to be sufficiently similar on some representation. As a consequence, a simple and computationally efficient soft-isomorphic relational graph convolution network (SIR-GCN) that emphasizes the contextualized transformation of neighborhood feature representations via anisotropic and dynamic message functions is proposed. Furthermore, a mathematical discussion on the relationship between SIR-GCN and key GNNs in literature is laid out to put the contribution into context, establishing SIR-GCN as a generalization of classical GNN methodologies. To close, experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the relative superiority of SIR-GCN, outperforming comparable models in node and graph property prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Relational Deep Learning with Pretrained Tabular Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04934v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational databases, organized into tables connected by primary-foreign key relationships, are a common format for organizing data. Making predictions on relational data often involves transforming them into a flat tabular format through table joins and feature engineering, which serve as input to tabular methods. However, designing features that fully capture complex relational patterns remains challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a compelling alternative by inherently modeling these relationships, but their time overhead during inference limits their applicability for real-time scenarios. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging existing feature engineering efforts to enhance the efficiency of GNNs in relational databases. Specifically, we use GNNs to capture complex relationships within relational databases, patterns that are difficult to featurize, while employing engineered features to encode temporal information, thereby avoiding the need to retain the entire historical graph and enabling the use of smaller, more efficient graphs. Our \textsc{LightRDL} approach not only improves efficiency, but also outperforms existing models. Experimental results on the RelBench benchmark demonstrate that our framework achieves up to $33\%$ performance improvement and a $526\times$ inference speedup compared to GNNs, making it highly suitable for real-time inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[BriLLM: Brain-inspired Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11299v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper reports the first brain-inspired large language model (BriLLM). This is a non-Transformer, non-GPT, non-traditional machine learning input-output controlled generative language model. The model is based on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) definition on the directed graph in terms of the neural network, and has the interpretability of all nodes on the graph of the whole model, instead of the traditional machine learning model that only has limited interpretability at the input and output ends. In the language model scenario, the token is defined as a node in the graph. A randomly shaped or user-defined signal flow flows between nodes on the principle of "least resistance" along paths. The next token or node to be predicted or generated is the target of the signal flow. As a language model, BriLLM theoretically supports infinitely long $n$-gram models when the model size is independent of the input and predicted length of the model. The model's working signal flow provides the possibility of recall activation and innate multi-modal support similar to the cognitive patterns of the human brain. At present, we released the first BriLLM version in Chinese, with 4000 tokens, 32-dimensional node width, 16-token long sequence prediction ability, and language model prediction performance comparable to GPT-1. More computing power will help us explore the infinite possibilities depicted above.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attentional Graph Meta-Learning for Indoor Localization Using Extremely Sparse Fingerprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04829v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fingerprint-based indoor localization is often labor-intensive due to the need for dense grids and repeated measurements across time and space. Maintaining high localization accuracy with extremely sparse fingerprints remains a persistent challenge. Existing benchmark methods primarily rely on the measured fingerprints, while neglecting valuable spatial and environmental characteristics. In this paper, we propose a systematic integration of an Attentional Graph Neural Network (AGNN) model, capable of learning spatial adjacency relationships and aggregating information from neighboring fingerprints, and a meta-learning framework that utilizes datasets with similar environmental characteristics to enhance model training. To minimize the labor required for fingerprint collection, we introduce two novel data augmentation strategies: 1) unlabeled fingerprint augmentation using moving platforms, which enables the semi-supervised AGNN model to incorporate information from unlabeled fingerprints, and 2) synthetic labeled fingerprint augmentation through environmental digital twins, which enhances the meta-learning framework through a practical distribution alignment, which can minimize the feature discrepancy between synthetic and real-world fingerprints effectively. By integrating these novel modules, we propose the Attentional Graph Meta-Learning (AGML) model. This novel model combines the strengths of the AGNN model and the meta-learning framework to address the challenges posed by extremely sparse fingerprints. To validate our approach, we collected multiple datasets from both consumer-grade WiFi devices and professional equipment across diverse environments. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the AGML model-based localization method consistently outperforms all baseline methods using sparse fingerprints across all evaluated metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attentional Graph Neural Network Is All You Need for Robust Massive Network Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16856v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we design Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms to tackle an important yet challenging nonlinear regression problem: massive network localization. We first review our previous network localization method based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which can exhibit state-of-the-art localization accuracy, even under severe Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions, by carefully preselecting a constant threshold for determining adjacency. As an extension, we propose a specially designed Attentional GNN (AGNN) model to resolve the sensitive thresholding issue of the GCN-based method and enhance the underlying model capacity. The AGNN comprises an Adjacency Learning Module (ALM) and Multiple Graph Attention Layers (MGAL), employing distinct attention architectures to systematically address the demerits of the GCN-based method, rendering it more practical for real-world applications. Comprehensive analyses are conducted to explain the superior performance of these methods, including a theoretical analysis of the AGNN's dynamic attention property and computational complexity, along with a systematic discussion of their robust characteristic against NLOS measurements. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GCN-based and AGNN-based network localization methods. Notably, integrating attention mechanisms into the AGNN yields substantial improvements in localization accuracy, approaching the fundamental lower bound and showing approximately 37\% to 53\% reduction in localization error compared to the vanilla GCN-based method across various NLOS noise configurations. Both methods outperform all competing approaches by far in terms of localization accuracy, robustness, and computational time, especially for considerably large network sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Hierarchical Protein Multi-Modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04770v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks. Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural information. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Through extensive experiments on a diverse set of protein-related tasks, our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including react (enzyme/EC classification), model quality assessment (MQA), protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (LBA), protein-protein binding site prediction (PPBS), and B cell epitopes prediction (BCEs). Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of BIHIERARCHICAL FUSION in bridging sequence and structural modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedGNN: Capturing the Links Between Urban Characteristics and Medical Prescriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04739v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how urban socio-demographic and environmental factors relate with health is essential for public health and urban planning. However, traditional statistical methods struggle with nonlinear effects, while machine learning models often fail to capture geographical (nearby areas being more similar) and topological (unequal connectivity between places) effects in an interpretable way. To address this, we propose MedGNN, a spatio-topologically explicit framework that constructs a 2-hop spatial graph, integrating positional and locational node embeddings with urban characteristics in a graph neural network. Applied to MEDSAT, a comprehensive dataset covering over 150 environmental and socio-demographic factors and six prescription outcomes (depression, anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and opioids) across 4,835 Greater London neighborhoods, MedGNN improved predictions by over 25% on average compared to baseline methods. Using depression prescriptions as a case study, we analyzed graph embeddings via geographical principal component analysis, identifying findings that: align with prior research (e.g., higher antidepressant prescriptions among older and White populations), contribute to ongoing debates (e.g., greenery linked to higher and NO2 to lower prescriptions), and warrant further study (e.g., canopy evaporation correlated with fewer prescriptions). These results demonstrate MedGNN's potential, and more broadly, of carefully applied machine learning, to advance transdisciplinary public health research.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages' main content.

| **[Sparsity-Aware Communication for Distributed Graph Neural Network Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04673v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a computationally efficient method to learn embeddings and classifications on graph data. However, GNN training has low computational intensity, making communication costs the bottleneck for scalability. Sparse-matrix dense-matrix multiplication (SpMM) is the core computational operation in full-graph training of GNNs. Previous work parallelizing this operation focused on sparsity-oblivious algorithms, where matrix elements are communicated regardless of the sparsity pattern. This leads to a predictable communication pattern that can be overlapped with computation and enables the use of collective communication operations at the expense of wasting significant bandwidth by communicating unnecessary data. We develop sparsity-aware algorithms that tackle the communication bottlenecks in GNN training with three novel approaches. First, we communicate only the necessary matrix elements. Second, we utilize a graph partitioning model to reorder the matrix and drastically reduce the amount of communicated elements. Finally, we address the high load imbalance in communication with a tailored partitioning model, which minimizes both the total communication volume and the maximum sending volume. We further couple these sparsity-exploiting approaches with a communication-avoiding approach (1.5D parallel SpMM) in which submatrices are replicated to reduce communication. We explore the tradeoffs of these combined optimizations and show up to 14X improvement on 256 GPUs and on some instances reducing communication to almost zero resulting in a communication-free parallel training relative to a popular GNN framework based on communication-oblivious SpMM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Graph Neural Networks for Particle Track Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04670v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle track reconstruction is an important problem in high-energy physics (HEP), necessary to study properties of subatomic particles. Traditional track reconstruction algorithms scale poorly with the number of particles within the accelerator. The Exa.TrkX project, to alleviate this computational burden, introduces a pipeline that reduces particle track reconstruction to edge classification on a graph, and uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to produce particle tracks. However, this GNN-based approach is memory-prohibitive and skips graphs that would exceed GPU memory. We introduce improvements to the Exa.TrkX pipeline to train on samples of input particle graphs, and show that these improvements generalize to higher precision and recall. In addition, we adapt performance optimizations, introduced for GNN training, to fit our augmented Exa.TrkX pipeline. These optimizations provide a $2\times$ speedup over our baseline implementation in PyTorch Geometric.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Network (GNN) execution involves both compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels, the latter dominates the total time, being significantly bottlenecked by data movement between memory and processors. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) systems can alleviate this data movement bottleneck by placing simple processors near or inside to memory arrays. In this work, we introduce PyGim, an efficient ML library that accelerates GNNs on real PIM systems. We propose intelligent parallelization techniques for memory-intensive kernels of GNNs tailored for real PIM systems, and develop handy Python API for them. We provide hybrid GNN execution, in which the compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels are executed in processor-centric and memory-centric computing systems, respectively. We extensively evaluate PyGim on a real-world PIM system with 1992 PIM cores using emerging GNN models, and demonstrate that it outperforms its state-of-the-art CPU counterpart on Intel Xeon by on average 3.04x, and achieves higher resource utilization than CPU and GPU systems. Our work provides useful recommendations for software, system and hardware designers. PyGim is publicly available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/PyGim.</p></details> |  |
| **[Link Prediction with Physics-Inspired Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14802v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The message-passing mechanism underlying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is not naturally suited for heterophilic datasets, where adjacent nodes often have different labels. Most solutions to this problem remain confined to the task of node classification. In this article, we focus on the valuable task of link prediction under heterophily, an interesting problem for recommendation systems, social network analysis, and other applications. GNNs like GRAFF have improved node classification under heterophily by incorporating physics biases in the architecture. Similarly, we propose GRAFF-LP, an extension of GRAFF for link prediction. We show that GRAFF-LP effectively discriminates existing from non-existing edges by learning implicitly to separate the edge gradients. Based on this information, we propose a new readout function inspired by physics. Remarkably, this new function not only enhances the performance of GRAFF-LP but also improves that of other baseline models, leading us to reconsider how every link prediction experiment has been conducted so far. Finally, we provide evidence that even simple GNNs did not experience greater difficulty in predicting heterophilic links compared to homophilic ones. This leads us to believe in the necessity for heterophily measures specifically tailored for link prediction, distinct from those used in node classification.

However, they struggle with long-range dependencies in fluid flows, particularly in refined mesh regions. This challenge, known as the 'over-squashing' problem, hinders information propagation. While existing graph rewiring methods address this issue to some extent, they only consider graph topology, overlooking the underlying physical phenomena. We propose Physics-Informed Ollivier-Ricci Flow (PIORF), a novel rewiring method that combines physical correlations with graph topology. PIORF uses Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC) to identify bottleneck regions and connects these areas with nodes in high-velocity gradient nodes, enabling long-range interactions and mitigating over-squashing. Our approach is computationally efficient in rewiring edges and can scale to larger simulations. Experimental results on 3 fluid dynamics benchmark datasets show that PIORF consistently outperforms baseline models and existing rewiring methods, achieving up to 26.2 improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Traditional CNNs excel at extracting rich spatial features from images but lack the inherent capability to model inter-object relationships. Conversely, conventional GNNs typically rely on flattened node features, thereby discarding vital spatial details. TGraphX overcomes these limitations by employing CNNs to generate multi-dimensional node features (e.g., (3*128*128) tensors) that preserve local spatial semantics. These spatially aware nodes participate in a graph where message passing is performed using 1*1 convolutions, which fuse adjacent features while maintaining their structure. Furthermore, a deep CNN aggregator with residual connections is used to robustly refine the fused messages, ensuring stable gradient flow and end-to-end trainability. Our approach not only bridges the gap between spatial feature extraction and relational reasoning but also demonstrates significant improvements in object detection refinement and ensemble reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to arXiv.

Current strategies for processing point clouds typically downsample the scene or divide it into smaller parts for separate analysis. However, both approaches risk losing key local details or global contextual information. In this paper, we introduce PerLA, a 3D language assistant designed to be more perceptive to both details and context, making visual representations more informative for the LLM. PerLA captures high-resolution (local) details in parallel from different point cloud areas and integrates them with (global) context obtained from a lower-resolution whole point cloud. We present a novel algorithm that preserves point cloud locality through the Hilbert curve and effectively aggregates local-to-global information via cross-attention and a graph neural network. Lastly, we introduce a novel loss for local representation consensus to promote training stability. PerLA outperforms state-of-the-art 3D language assistants, with gains of up to +1.34 CiDEr on ScanQA for question answering, and +4.22 on ScanRefer and +3.88 on Nr3D for dense captioning. https://gfmei.github.io/PerLA/</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

For this reason, reducing the number of two-qubit gates is of paramount importance on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. To advance towards more reliable quantum computing, we introduce a framework based on ZX calculus, graph-neural networks and reinforcement learning for quantum circuit optimization. By combining reinforcement learning and tree search, our method addresses the challenge of selecting optimal sequences of ZX calculus rewrite rules. Instead of relying on existing heuristic rules for minimizing circuits, our method trains a novel reinforcement learning policy that directly operates on ZX-graphs, therefore allowing us to search through the space of all possible circuit transformations to find a circuit significantly minimizing the number of CNOT gates. This way we can scale beyond hard-coded rules towards discovering arbitrary optimization rules. We demonstrate our method's competetiveness with state-of-the-art circuit optimizers and generalization capabilities on large sets of diverse random circuits.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the nonconvexities that arise in power generation systems, there is not yet a fast, robust solution technique for the full Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). In the last decades, power grids have evolved into a typical dynamic, non-linear and large-scale control system, known as the power system, so searching for better and faster ACOPF solutions is becoming crucial. Appearance of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has allowed the natural use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on graph data, such as power networks. On the other hand, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is known for its powerful capability to solve complex decision-making problems. Although solutions that use these two methods separately are beginning to appear in the literature, none has yet combined the advantages of both. We propose a novel architecture based on the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm with Graph Neural Networks to solve the Optimal Power Flow. The objective is to design an architecture that learns how to solve the optimization problem and that is at the same time able to generalize to unseen scenarios. We compare our solution with the DCOPF in terms of cost after having trained our DRL agent on IEEE 30 bus system and then computing the OPF on that base network with topology changes</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, due to the vulnerabilities of GNNs, it has been empirically proved that malicious attackers could easily corrupt the fairness level of their predictions by adding perturbations to the input graph data. In this paper, we take crucial steps to study a novel problem of certifiable defense on the fairness level of GNNs. Specifically, we propose a principled framework named ELEGANT and present a detailed theoretical certification analysis for the fairness of GNNs. ELEGANT takes any GNNs as its backbone, and the fairness level of such a backbone is theoretically impossible to be corrupted under certain perturbation budgets for attackers. Notably, ELEGANT does not have any assumption over the GNN structure or parameters, and does not require re-training the GNNs to realize certification. Hence it can serve as a plug-and-play framework for any optimized GNNs ready to be deployed. We verify the satisfactory effectiveness of ELEGANT in practice through extensive experiments on real-world datasets across different backbones of GNNs, where ELEGANT is also demonstrated to be beneficial for GNN debiasing.

This work benchmarks various GNN architectures to identify the most effective methods for heterogeneous graphs, with a particular focus on node classification and link prediction. Our findings reveal that graph attention networks excel in these tasks. As a main contribution, we explore enhancements to these attention networks by integrating positional encodings for node embeddings. This involves utilizing the full Laplacian spectrum to accurately capture both the relative and absolute positions of each node within the graph, further enhancing performance on downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

The architecture and connectivity of the MI-HGNN are constructed from the robot morphology, in which nodes and edges are robot joints and links, respectively. By incorporating the morphology-informed constraints into a neural network, we improve a learning-based approach using model-based knowledge. We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness, generalization ability, model efficiency, and sample efficiency. Our MI-HGNN improved the performance of a state-of-the-art model that leverages robot morphological symmetry by 8.4% with only 0.21% of its parameters. Although MI-HGNN is applied to contact perception problems for legged robots in this work, it can be seamlessly applied to other types of multi-body dynamical systems and has the potential to improve other robot learning frameworks.

| **[A Hybrid Similarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02615v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node classification has gained significant importance in graph deep learning with real-world applications such as recommendation systems, drug discovery, and citation networks. Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Transformers have achieved superior performance in node classification tasks. However, the key concern with Graph Convolutional Networks is over-squashing, which limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies in the network. Additionally, Graph Transformers face scalability challenges, making it difficult to process large graphs efficiently. To address this, we propose a novel framework, A Hybrid SImilarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification (SIGNNet), which capitalizes on local and global structural information, enhances the model's capability to effectively capture fine-grained relationships and broader contextual patterns within the graph structure. The proposed method leverages Graph Convolutional Networks alongside a score-based mechanism to effectively capture local and global node interactions while addressing the limitations of over-squashing. Our proposed method employs a novel Personalized PageRank-based node sampling method to address scalability issues by generating subgraphs of nodes. Additionally, SIGNNet incorporates a novel attention mechanism, Structure-Aware Multi-Head Attention (SA-MHA), which integrates node structural information for informed attention weighting, enabling the model to prioritize nodes based on topological significance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods, with average accuracy gains of 6.03%, 5.47%, 4.78%, 19.10%, 19.61%, 7.22%, 19.54%, and 14.94% on Cora, Citeseer, CS, Wisconsin, Texas, Actor, Cornell and Chameleon datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward General and Robust LLM-enhanced Text-attributed Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02343v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the proliferation of Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) across various domains have positioned LLM-enhanced TAG learning as a critical research area. By utilizing rich graph descriptions, this paradigm leverages LLMs to generate high-quality embeddings, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the field faces significant challenges: (1) the absence of a unified framework to systematize the diverse optimization perspectives arising from the complex interactions between LLMs and GNNs, and (2) the lack of a robust method capable of handling real-world TAGs, which often suffer from texts and edge sparsity, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose UltraTAG, a unified pipeline for LLM-enhanced TAG learning. UltraTAG provides a unified comprehensive and domain-adaptive framework that not only organizes existing methodologies but also paves the way for future advancements in the field. Building on this framework, we propose UltraTAG-S, a robust instantiation of UltraTAG designed to tackle the inherent sparsity issues in real-world TAGs. UltraTAG-S employs LLM-based text propagation and text augmentation to mitigate text sparsity, while leveraging LLM-augmented node selection techniques based on PageRank and edge reconfiguration strategies to address edge sparsity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraTAG-S significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving improvements of 2.12\% and 17.47\% in ideal and sparse settings, respectively. Moreover, as the data sparsity ratio increases, the performance improvement of UltraTAG-S also rises, which underscores the effectiveness and robustness of UltraTAG-S.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Customer Contact Efficiency with Graph Neural Networks in Credit Card Fraud Detection Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02275v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Credit card fraud has been a persistent issue since the last century, causing significant financial losses to the industry. The most effective way to prevent fraud is by contacting customers to verify suspicious transactions. However, while these systems are designed to detect fraudulent activity, they often mistakenly flag legitimate transactions, leading to unnecessary declines that disrupt the user experience and erode customer trust. Frequent false positives can frustrate customers, resulting in dissatisfaction, increased complaints, and a diminished sense of security. To address these limitations, we propose a fraud detection framework incorporating Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying fraudulent transactions. By leveraging the relational structure of transaction data, our model reduces the need for direct customer confirmation while maintaining high detection performance. Our experiments are conducted using the IBM credit card transaction dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.</p></details> |  |

However, many popular methods are prone to random walk behavior, i.e., diffusion-like exploration of the sample space, leading to slow mixing that requires intricate tuning to alleviate. Non-reversible samplers can resolve some of these issues. We introduce a device that turns jump processes that satisfy a skew-detailed balance condition for a reference measure into a process that samples a target measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to the reference measure. The resulting sampler is rejection-free, non-reversible, and continuous-time. As an example, we apply the device to Hamiltonian dynamics discretized by the leapfrog integrator, resulting in a rejection-free non-reversible continuous-time version of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). We prove the geometric ergodicity of the resulting sampler under certain convexity conditions, and demonstrate its qualitatively different behavior to HMC through numerical examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 7 figures; updated with additional references to related work</p></details> |

Despite significant advancements in generative models capable of creating highly photorealistic images, existing detection methods often struggle to generalize across different models and are highly sensitive to minor perturbations. To address these challenges, DeeCLIP incorporates DeeFuser, a fusion module that combines high-level and low-level features, improving robustness against degradations such as compression and blurring. Additionally, we apply triplet loss to refine the embedding space, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between real and synthetic content. To further enable lightweight adaptation while preserving pre-trained knowledge, we adopt parameter-efficient fine-tuning using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) within the CLIP-ViT backbone. This approach supports effective zero-shot learning without sacrificing generalization. Trained exclusively on 4-class ProGAN data, DeeCLIP achieves an average accuracy of 89.00% on 19 test subsets composed of generative adversarial network (GAN) and diffusion models. Despite having fewer trainable parameters, DeeCLIP outperforms existing methods, demonstrating superior robustness against various generative models and real-world distortions. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Mamadou-Keita/DeeCLIP for research purposes.</p></details> |  |

However, SDS-based methods struggle to maintain semantic fidelity for user prompts, particularly when involving multiple objects with intricate interactions. While existing approaches often address 3D consistency through multiview diffusion model fine-tuning on 3D datasets, this strategy inadvertently exacerbates text-3D alignment degradation. The limitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases during optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment direction. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel SDS objective, dubbed as Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD), which integrates alignment feedback from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our TCSD leverages cross-modal understanding capabilities of MLLMs to assess and guide the text-3D correspondence during the optimization. We further develop 3DLLaVA-CRITIC - a fine-tuned MLLM specialized for evaluating multiview text alignment in 3D generations. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-layout initialization that significantly accelerates optimization convergence through semantic-aware spatial configuration. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework, CoherenDream, establishes state-of-the-art performance in text-aligned 3D generation across multiple benchmarks, including T$^3$Bench and TIFA subset. Qualitative results showcase the superior performance of CoherenDream in preserving textual consistency and semantic interactions. As the first study to incorporate MLLMs into SDS optimization, we also conduct extensive ablation studies to explore optimal MLLM adaptations for 3D generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniEdit: Building Image Editing Generalist Models Through Specialist Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07199v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-guided image editing methods have demonstrated significant potential by training diffusion models on automatically synthesized or manually annotated image editing pairs. However, these methods remain far from practical, real-life applications. We identify three primary challenges contributing to this gap. Firstly, existing models have limited editing skills due to the biased synthesis process. Secondly, these methods are trained with datasets with a high volume of noise and artifacts. This is due to the application of simple filtering methods like CLIP-score. Thirdly, all these datasets are restricted to a single low resolution and fixed aspect ratio, limiting the versatility to handle real-world use cases. In this paper, we present \omniedit, which is an omnipotent editor to handle seven different image editing tasks with any aspect ratio seamlessly. Our contribution is in four folds: (1) \omniedit is trained by utilizing the supervision from seven different specialist models to ensure task coverage. (2) we utilize importance sampling based on the scores provided by large multimodal models (like GPT-4o) instead of CLIP-score to improve the data quality. (3) we propose a new editing architecture called EditNet to greatly boost the editing success rate, (4) we provide images with different aspect ratios to ensure that our model can handle any image in the wild. We have curated a test set containing images of different aspect ratios, accompanied by diverse instructions to cover different tasks. Both automatic evaluation and human evaluations demonstrate that \omniedit can significantly outperform all the existing models. Our code, dataset and model will be available at https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/OmniEdit/</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Evolution Meets Diffusion: Efficient Neural Architecture Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17827v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we start from an naive assumption that text understanding is only a sufficient condition for text rendering, but not a necessary condition. Based on this, we present RepText, which aims to empower pre-trained monolingual text-to-image generation models with the ability to accurately render, or more precisely, replicate, multilingual visual text in user-specified fonts, without the need to really understand them. Specifically, we adopt the setting from ControlNet and additionally integrate language agnostic glyph and position of rendered text to enable generating harmonized visual text, allowing users to customize text content, font and position on their needs. To improve accuracy, a text perceptual loss is employed along with the diffusion loss. Furthermore, to stabilize rendering process, at the inference phase, we directly initialize with noisy glyph latent instead of random initialization, and adopt region masks to restrict the feature injection to only the text region to avoid distortion of the background. We conducted extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our RepText relative to existing works, our approach outperforms existing open-source methods and achieves comparable results to native multi-language closed-source models. To be more fair, we also exhaustively discuss its limitations in the end.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report. https://reptext.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Open-set Anomaly Segmentation in Complex Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19706v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise segmentation of out-of-distribution (OoD) objects, herein referred to as anomalies, is crucial for the reliable deployment of semantic segmentation models in open-set, safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving. Current anomalous segmentation benchmarks predominantly focus on favorable weather conditions, resulting in untrustworthy evaluations that overlook the risks posed by diverse meteorological conditions in open-set environments, such as low illumination, dense fog, and heavy rain. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the ComsAmy, a challenging benchmark specifically designed for open-set anomaly segmentation in complex scenarios. ComsAmy encompasses a wide spectrum of adverse weather conditions, dynamic driving environments, and diverse anomaly types to comprehensively evaluate the model performance in realistic open-world scenarios. Our extensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art anomalous segmentation models reveals that existing methods demonstrate significant deficiencies in such challenging scenarios, highlighting their serious safety risks for real-world deployment. To solve that, we propose a novel energy-entropy learning (EEL) strategy that integrates the complementary information from energy and entropy to bolster the robustness of anomaly segmentation under complex open-world environments. Additionally, a diffusion-based anomalous training data synthesizer is proposed to generate diverse and high-quality anomalous images to enhance the existing copy-paste training data synthesizer. Extensive experimental results on both public and ComsAmy benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed diffusion-based synthesizer with energy and entropy learning (DiffEEL) serves as an effective and generalizable plug-and-play method to enhance existing models, yielding an average improvement of around 4.96% in $\rm{AUPRC}$ and 9.87% in $\rm{FPR}_{95}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Basic Evaluation of Neural Networks Trained with the Error Diffusion Learning Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14814v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial neural networks are powerful tools capable of addressing various tasks. Although the backpropagation algorithm has become a standard training method for these neural networks, its lack of biological plausibility has inspired the development of alternative learning approaches. One such alternative is Kaneko's Error Diffusion Learning Algorithm (EDLA), a biologically motivated approach wherein a single global error signal diffuses throughout a network composed of paired excitatory-inhibitory sublayers, thereby eliminating the necessity for layer-wise backpropagation. This study presents a contemporary formulation of the EDLA framework and evaluates its effectiveness through parity check, regression, and image classification tasks. Our experimental results indicate that EDLA networks can consistently achieve high accuracy across these benchmarks, with performance efficiency and convergence speed notably influenced by the choice of learning rate, neuron count, and network depth. Further investigation of the internal representations formed by EDLA networks reveals their capacity for meaningful feature extraction, similar to traditional neural networks. These results suggest that EDLA is a biologically motivated alternative for training feedforward networks and will motivate future work on extending this method to biologically inspired neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Conditioned Diffusive Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19669v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models achieve remarkable success in processing images and text, and have been extended to special domains such as time series forecasting (TSF). Existing diffusion-based approaches for TSF primarily focus on modeling single-modality numerical sequences, overlooking the rich multimodal information in time series data. To effectively leverage such information for prediction, we propose a multimodal conditioned diffusion model for TSF, namely, MCD-TSF, to jointly utilize timestamps and texts as extra guidance for time series modeling, especially for forecasting. Specifically, Timestamps are combined with time series to establish temporal and semantic correlations among different data points when aggregating information along the temporal dimension. Texts serve as supplementary descriptions of time series' history, and adaptively aligned with data points as well as dynamically controlled in a classifier-free manner. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets across eight domains demonstrate that the proposed MCD-TSF model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

While the diffusion model allows for high-quality motion generation, its computational cost is too expensive to control a robot in real time. To achieve high quality and efficiency simultaneously, our one-step diffusion model takes an approximately generated motion, which is predicted directly from input images. This approximate motion is optimized by additive noise provided by our novel noise optimizer. Unlike general isotropic noise, our noise optimizer adjusts noise anisotropically depending on the uncertainty of each motion element. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining its efficiency by one-step diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making significant contributions to the field of image editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step1X-Edit</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Stochastic Learning Over Adaptive Competing Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19635v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies a stochastic dynamic game between two competing teams, each consisting of a network of collaborating agents. Unlike fully cooperative settings, where all agents share a common objective, each team in this game aims to minimize its own distinct objective. In the adversarial setting, their objectives could be conflicting as in zero-sum games. Throughout the competition, agents share strategic information within their own team while simultaneously inferring and adapting to the strategies of the opposing team. We propose diffusion learning algorithms to address two important classes of this network game: i) a zero-sum game characterized by weak cross-team subgraph interactions, and ii) a general non-zero-sum game exhibiting strong cross-team subgraph interactions. We analyze the stability performance of the proposed algorithms under reasonable assumptions and illustrate the theoretical results through experiments on Cournot team competition and decentralized GAN training.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical framework to evaluate the dependency of medical imaging ML models on sensitive attributes, such as demographics. Our method leverages the concept of counterfactual invariance, measuring the extent to which a model's predictions remain unchanged under hypothetical changes to sensitive attributes. We present a practical algorithm that combines conditional latent diffusion models with statistical hypothesis testing to identify and quantify such biases without requiring direct access to counterfactual data. Through experiments on synthetic datasets and large-scale real-world medical imaging datasets, including \textsc{cheXpert} and MIMIC-CXR, we demonstrate that our approach aligns closely with counterfactual fairness principles and outperforms standard baselines. This work provides a robust tool to ensure that ML diagnostic systems generalize well, e.g., across demographic groups, offering a critical step towards AI safety in healthcare.

Yet, the videos generated by recent works suffer from poor quality and spatiotemporal consistency, undermining their utility in advancing perception tasks under driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DiVE, a diffusion transformer-based generative framework meticulously engineered to produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent, and cross-view consistent multi-view videos, aligning seamlessly with bird's-eye view layouts and textual descriptions. DiVE leverages a unified cross-attention and a SketchFormer to exert precise control over multimodal data, while incorporating a view-inflated attention mechanism that adds no extra parameters, thereby guaranteeing consistency across views. Despite these advancements, synthesizing high-resolution videos under multimodal constraints introduces dual challenges: investigating the optimal classifier-free guidance coniguration under intricate multi-condition inputs and mitigating excessive computational latency in high-resolution rendering--both of which remain underexplored in prior researches. To resolve these limitations, we introduce two innovations: Multi-Control Auxiliary Branch Distillation, which streamlines multi-condition CFG selection while circumventing high computational overhead, and Resolution Progressive Sampling, a training-free acceleration strategy that staggers resolution scaling to reduce high latency due to high resolution. These innovations collectively achieve a 2.62x speedup with minimal quality degradation. Evaluated on the nuScenes dataset, DiVE achieves SOTA performance in multi-view video generation, yielding photorealistic outputs with exceptional temporal and cross-view coherence.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we consider the case where one has to resort to time discretization of the diffusion and numerical simulation of such schemes. Inspired by recent works, we introduce a new MLMC estimator of expectations, which does not require any L\'evy area simulation and has a strong error of order 2 and a weak error of order 2. We then show how this approach can be used in the context of the filtering problem associated to partially observed diffusions with discrete time observations. We illustrate that in numerical simulations our new approaches provide efficiency gains for several problems, particularly when the diffusion process is hypo-elliptic, relative to some existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Since adjacent pixels are highly likely to belong to the same object, we propose the Heat Diffusion Model (HDM) to further preserve image details and generate more realistic images. HDM is a model that incorporates pixel-level operations while maintaining the same training process as DDPM. In HDM, the discrete form of the two-dimensional heat equation is integrated into the diffusion and generation formulas of DDPM, enabling the model to compute relationships between neighboring pixels during image processing. Our experiments demonstrate that HDM can generate higher-quality samples compared to models such as DDPM, Consistency Diffusion Models (CDM), Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), and Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN).</p></details> |  |

Existing image watermarking methods, though partially effective, often rely on post-processing or reference images, and struggle to balance fidelity, robustness, and tamper localization. To address these limitations, we propose GenPTW, an In-Generation image watermarking framework for latent diffusion models (LDMs), which integrates Provenance Tracing and Tamper Localization into a unified Watermark-based design. It embeds structured watermark signals during the image generation phase, enabling unified provenance tracing and tamper localization. For extraction, we construct a frequency-coordinated decoder to improve robustness and localization precision in complex editing scenarios. Additionally, a distortion layer that simulates AIGC editing is introduced to enhance robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenPTW outperforms existing methods in image fidelity, watermark extraction accuracy, and tamper localization performance, offering an efficient and practical solution for trustworthy AIGC image generation.</p></details> |  |

Despite these successes, VLAs struggle with novel robot setups and require fine-tuning to achieve good performance, yet how to most effectively fine-tune them is unclear given many possible strategies. In this work, we study key VLA adaptation design choices such as different action decoding schemes, action representations, and learning objectives for fine-tuning, using OpenVLA as our representative base model. Our empirical analysis informs an Optimized Fine-Tuning (OFT) recipe that integrates parallel decoding, action chunking, a continuous action representation, and a simple L1 regression-based learning objective to altogether improve inference efficiency, policy performance, and flexibility in the model's input-output specifications. We propose OpenVLA-OFT, an instantiation of this recipe, which sets a new state of the art on the LIBERO simulation benchmark, significantly boosting OpenVLA's average success rate across four task suites from 76.5% to 97.1% while increasing action generation throughput by 26$\times$. In real-world evaluations, our fine-tuning recipe enables OpenVLA to successfully execute dexterous, high-frequency control tasks on a bimanual ALOHA robot and outperform other VLAs ($\pi_0$ and RDT-1B) fine-tuned using their default recipes, as well as strong imitation learning policies trained from scratch (Diffusion Policy and ACT) by up to 15% (absolute) in average success rate.

It is very challenging due to the high dimensionality of the data and the temporal consistency required for obtaining convincing results. Recently, diffusion models have shown impressive results in modeling complex data distributions, including images and videos. Such models remain nonetheless very expensive to train and to perform inference with, which strongly reduce their applicability to videos, and yields unreasonable computational loads. We show that in the case of video inpainting, thanks to the highly auto-similar nature of videos, the training data of a diffusion model can be restricted to the input video and still produce very satisfying results. With this internal learning approach, where the training data is limited to a single video, our lightweight models perform very well with only half a million parameters, in contrast to the very large networks with billions of parameters typically found in the literature. We also introduce a new method for efficient training and inference of diffusion models in the context of internal learning, by splitting the diffusion process into different learning intervals corresponding to different noise levels of the diffusion process. We show qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating that our method reaches or exceeds state of the art performance in the case of dynamic textures and complex dynamic backgrounds</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures.

Despite recent advances, the scarcity of high-quality data that balances diversity, plausibility, and fidelity remains a major obstacle. To address this challenge, we identify three critical elements: leveraging in-the-wild image data for diversity, incorporating human expertise for plausibility, and utilizing generative priors for fidelity. We propose SynergyAmodal, a novel framework for co-synthesizing in-the-wild amodal datasets with comprehensive shape and appearance annotations, which integrates these elements through a tripartite data-human-model collaboration. First, we design an occlusion-grounded self-supervised learning algorithm to harness the diversity of in-the-wild image data, fine-tuning an inpainting diffusion model into a partial completion diffusion model. Second, we establish a co-synthesis pipeline to iteratively filter, refine, select, and annotate the initial deocclusion results of the partial completion diffusion model, ensuring plausibility and fidelity through human expert guidance and prior model constraints. This pipeline generates a high-quality paired amodal dataset with extensive category and scale diversity, comprising approximately 16K pairs. Finally, we train a full completion diffusion model on the synthesized dataset, incorporating text prompts as conditioning signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in achieving zero-shot generalization and textual controllability. Our code, dataset, and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/imlixinyang/SynergyAmodal.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Simultaneous Pick and Place Detection by Combining SE(3) Diffusion Models with Differential Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19502v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grasp detection methods typically target the detection of a set of free-floating hand poses that can grasp the object. However, not all of the detected grasp poses are executable due to physical constraints. Even though it is straightforward to filter invalid grasp poses in the post-process, such a two-staged approach is computationally inefficient, especially when the constraint is hard. In this work, we propose an approach to take the following two constraints into account during the grasp detection stage, namely, (i) the picked object must be able to be placed with a predefined configuration without in-hand manipulation (ii) it must be reachable by the robot under the joint limit and collision-avoidance constraints for both pick and place cases. Our key idea is to train an SE(3) grasp diffusion network to estimate the noise in the form of spatial velocity, and constrain the denoising process by a multi-target differential inverse kinematics with an inequality constraint, so that the states are guaranteed to be reachable and placement can be performed without collision. In addition to an improved success ratio, we experimentally confirmed that our approach is more efficient and consistent in computation time compared to a naive two-stage approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance Evaluation of Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Quantum Dynamics Algorithms on the Advection-Diffusion Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24045v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the potential of near-term quantum algorithms for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), focusing on a linear one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation as a test case. This study benchmarks a ground-state algorithm, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), against three leading quantum dynamics algorithms, Trotterization, Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQTE), and Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics Simulation (AVQDS), applied to the same PDE on small quantum hardware. While Trotterization is fully quantum, VarQTE and AVQDS are variational algorithms that reduce circuit depth for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, hardware results from these dynamics methods show sizable errors due to noise and limited shot statistics. To establish a noise-free performance baseline, we implement the VQE-based solver on a noiseless statevector simulator. Our results show VQE can reach final-time infidelities as low as ${O}(10^{-9})$ with $N=4$ qubits and moderate circuit depths, outperforming hardware-deployed dynamics methods that show infidelities $\gtrsim 10^{-1}$. By comparing noiseless VQE to shot-based and hardware-run algorithms, we assess their accuracy and resource demands, providing a baseline for future quantum PDE solvers. We conclude with a discussion of limitations and potential extensions to higher-dimensional, nonlinear PDEs relevant to engineering and finance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures. v2: added references, corrected typos</p></details> |
| **[Lifting Motion to the 3D World via 2D Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18808v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating 3D motion from 2D observations is a long-standing research challenge. Prior work typically requires training on datasets containing ground truth 3D motions, limiting their applicability to activities well-represented in existing motion capture data. This dependency particularly hinders generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios or subjects where collecting 3D ground truth is challenging, such as complex athletic movements or animal motion. We introduce MVLift, a novel approach to predict global 3D motion -- including both joint rotations and root trajectories in the world coordinate system -- using only 2D pose sequences for training. Our multi-stage framework leverages 2D motion diffusion models to progressively generate consistent 2D pose sequences across multiple views, a key step in recovering accurate global 3D motion. MVLift generalizes across various domains, including human poses, human-object interactions, and animal poses. Despite not requiring 3D supervision, it outperforms prior work on five datasets, including those methods that require 3D supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (Highlight), project page: https://lijiaman.github.io/projects/mvlift/</p></details> |
| **[Automated Black-box Prompt Engineering for Personalized Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19103v3)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering is an effective but labor-intensive way to control text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Its time-intensive nature and complexity have spurred the development of algorithms for automated prompt generation. However, these methods often struggle with transferability across T2I models, require white-box access to the underlying model, or produce non-intuitive prompts. In this work, we introduce PRISM, an algorithm that automatically produces human-interpretable and transferable prompts that can effectively generate desired concepts given only black-box access to T2I models. Inspired by large language model (LLM) jailbreaking, PRISM leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs to iteratively refine the candidate prompt distribution built upon the reference images. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of PRISM in generating accurate prompts for objects, styles, and images across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Consistent Nested Diffusion Bridge for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09998v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerated MRI reconstruction plays a vital role in reducing scan time while preserving image quality. While most existing methods rely on complex-valued image-space or k-space data, these formats are often inaccessible in clinical practice due to proprietary reconstruction pipelines, leaving only magnitude images stored in DICOM files. To address this gap, we focus on the underexplored task of magnitude-image-based MRI reconstruction. Recent advancements in diffusion models, particularly denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling image priors. However, their task-agnostic denoising nature limits performance in source-to-target image translation tasks, such as MRI reconstruction. In this work, we propose a novel Self-Consistent Nested Diffusion Bridge (SC-NDB) framework that models accelerated MRI reconstruction as a bi-directional image translation process between under-sampled and fully-sampled magnitude MRI images. SC-NDB introduces a nested diffusion architecture with a self-consistency constraint and reverse bridge diffusion pathways to improve intermediate prediction fidelity and better capture the explicit priors of source images. Furthermore, we incorporate a Contour Decomposition Embedding Module (CDEM) to inject structural and textural knowledge by leveraging Laplacian pyramids and directional filter banks. Extensive experiments on the fastMRI and IXI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both magnitude-based and non-magnitude-based diffusion models, confirming the effectiveness and clinical relevance of SC-NDB.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTSD: Generative Text Steganography Based on Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19433v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of deep learning, existing generative text steganography methods based on autoregressive models have achieved success. However, these autoregressive steganography approaches have certain limitations. Firstly, existing methods require encoding candidate words according to their output probability and generating each stego word one by one, which makes the generation process time-consuming. Secondly, encoding and selecting candidate words changes the sampling probabilities, resulting in poor imperceptibility of the stego text. Thirdly, existing methods have low robustness and cannot resist replacement attacks. To address these issues, we propose a generative text steganography method based on a diffusion model (GTSD), which improves generative speed, robustness, and imperceptibility while maintaining security. To be specific, a novel steganography scheme based on diffusion model is proposed to embed secret information through prompt mapping and batch mapping. The prompt mapping maps secret information into a conditional prompt to guide the pre-trained diffusion model generating batches of candidate sentences. The batch mapping selects stego text based on secret information from batches of candidate sentences. Extensive experiments show that the GTSD outperforms the SOTA method in terms of generative speed, robustness, and imperceptibility while maintaining comparable anti-steganalysis performance. Moreover, we verify that the GTSD has strong potential: embedding capacity is positively correlated with prompt capacity and model batch sizes while maintaining security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided Multi-objective Generative AI to Enhance Structure-based Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11785v3)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. Yet, despite recent advances in deep learning, existing models cannot generate molecules that satisfy all desired physicochemical properties. Herein, we describe IDOLpro, a generative chemistry AI combining diffusion with multi-objective optimization for structure-based drug design. Differentiable scoring functions guide the latent variables of the diffusion model to explore uncharted chemical space and generate novel ligands in silico, optimizing a plurality of target physicochemical properties. We demonstrate our platform's effectiveness by generating ligands with optimized binding affinity and synthetic accessibility on two benchmark sets. IDOLpro produces ligands with binding affinities over 10%-20% better than the next best state-of-the-art method on each test set, producing more drug-like molecules with generally better synthetic accessibility scores than other methods. We do a head-to-head comparison of IDOLpro against a classic virtual screen of a large database of drug-like molecules. We show that IDOLpro can generate molecules for a range of important disease-related targets with better binding affinity and synthetic accessibility than any molecule found in the virtual screen while being over 100x faster and less expensive to run. On a test set of experimental complexes, IDOLpro is the first to produce molecules with better binding affinities than experimentally observed ligands. IDOLpro can accommodate other scoring functions (e.g. ADME-Tox) to accelerate hit-finding, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization for drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantitative estimates for a nonlinear inverse source problem in a coupled diffusion equations with uncertain measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19421v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers a nonlinear inverse source problem in a coupled diffusion equation from the terminal observation. Theoretically, under some conditions on problem data, we build the uniqueness theorem for this inverse problem and show two Lipschitz-type stability results in $L^2$ and $(H^1(\cdot))^*$ norms, respectively. However, in practice, we could only observe the measurements at discrete sensors, which contain the noise. Hence, this work further investigates the recovery of the unknown source from the discrete noisy measurements. We propose a stable inversion scheme and provide probabilistic convergence estimates between the reconstructions and exact solution in two cases: convergence respect to expectation and convergence with an exponential tail. We provide several numerical experiments to illustrate and complement our theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-based Semi-supervised and Unsupervised Methods for Local Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19419v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local clustering aims to identify specific substructures within a large graph without requiring full knowledge of the entire graph. These substructures are typically small compared to the overall graph, enabling the problem to be approached by finding a sparse solution to a linear system associated with the graph Laplacian. In this work, we first propose a method for identifying specific local clusters when very few labeled data is given, which we term semi-supervised local clustering. We then extend this approach to the unsupervised setting when no prior information on labels is available. The proposed methods involve randomly sampling the graph, applying diffusion through local cluster extraction, then examining the overlap among the results to find each cluster. We establish the co-membership conditions for any pair of nodes and rigorously prove the correctness of our methods. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-arts results in the low-label rates regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting 3D Liver Shape Datasets with Diffusion Models and Implicit Neural Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19402v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the availability of open 3D medical shape datasets is increasing, offering substantial benefits to the research community, we have found that many of these datasets are, unfortunately, disorganized and contain artifacts. These issues limit the development and training of robust models, particularly for accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. In this paper, we examine the current state of available 3D liver shape datasets and propose a solution using diffusion models combined with implicit neural representations (INRs) to augment and expand existing datasets. Our approach utilizes the generative capabilities of diffusion models to create realistic, diverse 3D liver shapes, capturing a wide range of anatomical variations and addressing the problem of data scarcity. Experimental results indicate that our method enhances dataset diversity, providing a scalable solution to improve the accuracy and reliability of 3D liver reconstruction and generation in medical applications. Finally, we suggest that diffusion models can also be applied to other downstream tasks in 3D medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Token-Shuffle: Towards High-Resolution Image Generation with Autoregressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17789v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models, long dominant in language generation, are increasingly applied to image synthesis but are often considered less competitive than Diffusion-based models. A primary limitation is the substantial number of image tokens required for AR models, which constrains both training and inference efficiency, as well as image resolution. To address this, we present Token-Shuffle, a novel yet simple method that reduces the number of image tokens in Transformer. Our key insight is the dimensional redundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where low-dimensional visual codes from visual encoder are directly mapped to high-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key operations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel dimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which untangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial arrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy requires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support extremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction way while maintaining efficient training and inference. For the first time, we push the boundary of AR text-to-image generation to a resolution of 2048x2048 with gratifying generation performance. In GenAI-benchmark, our 2.7B model achieves 0.77 overall score on hard prompts, outperforming AR models LlamaGen by 0.18 and diffusion models LDM by 0.15. Exhaustive large-scale human evaluations also demonstrate our prominent image generation ability in terms of text-alignment, visual flaw, and visual appearance. We hope that Token-Shuffle can serve as a foundational design for efficient high-resolution image generation within MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ma-xu.github.io/token-shuffle/ Add related works</p></details> |

Even with state-of-the-art robot learning methods, haptic-oblivious control strategies (i.e. those relying only on external vision and/or proprioception) often fall short due to occlusions, visual complexities, and the need for precise contact interaction control. To address these limitations, we introduce PolyTouch, a novel robot finger that integrates camera-based tactile sensing, acoustic sensing, and peripheral visual sensing into a single design that is compact and durable. PolyTouch provides high-resolution tactile feedback across multiple temporal scales, which is essential for efficiently learning complex manipulation tasks. Experiments demonstrate an at least 20-fold increase in lifespan over commercial tactile sensors, with a design that is both easy to manufacture and scalable. We then use this multi-modal tactile feedback along with visuo-proprioceptive observations to synthesize a tactile-diffusion policy from human demonstrations; the resulting contact-aware control policy significantly outperforms haptic-oblivious policies in multiple contact-aware manipulation policies. This paper highlights how effectively integrating multi-modal contact sensing can hasten the development of effective contact-aware manipulation policies, paving the way for more reliable and versatile domestic robots.

| **[AlphaFuse: Learn ID Embeddings for Sequential Recommendation in Null Space of Language Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19218v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in sequential recommendation have underscored the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhancing item embeddings. However, existing approaches face three key limitations: 1) the degradation of the semantic space when high-dimensional language embeddings are mapped to lower-dimensional ID embeddings, 2) the underutilization of language embeddings, and 3) the reliance on additional trainable parameters, such as an adapter, to bridge the gap between the semantic and behavior spaces.In this paper, we introduce AlphaFuse, a simple but effective language-guided learning strategy that addresses these challenges by learning ID embeddings within the null space of language embeddings. Specifically, we decompose the semantic space of language embeddings via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), distinguishing it into a semantic-rich row space and a semantic-sparse null space. Collaborative signals are then injected into the null space, while preserving the rich semantics of the row space. AlphaFuse prevents degradation of the semantic space, integrates the retained language embeddings into the final item embeddings, and eliminates the need for auxiliary trainable modules, enabling seamless adaptation to any sequential recommendation framework. We validate the effectiveness and flexibility of AlphaFuse through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, including cold-start user and long-tail settings, showcasing significant improvements in both discriminative and diffusion-based generative sequential recommenders. Our codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Hugo-Chinn/AlphaFuse.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hidden in the Noise: Two-Stage Robust Watermarking for Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04653v5)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques. In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.</p></details> |  |

Animators use the 2D sketches in storyboards as references to craft the desired 3D animations through a trial-and-error process. The traditional approach requires exceptional expertise and is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, there is a high demand for automated methods that can directly translate 2D storyboard sketches into 3D animations. This task is under-explored to date and inspired by the significant advancements of motion diffusion models, we propose to address it from the perspective of conditional motion synthesis. We thus present Sketch2Anim, composed of two key modules for sketch constraint understanding and motion generation. Specifically, due to the large domain gap between the 2D sketch and 3D motion, instead of directly conditioning on 2D inputs, we design a 3D conditional motion generator that simultaneously leverages 3D keyposes, joint trajectories, and action words, to achieve precise and fine-grained motion control. Then, we invent a neural mapper dedicated to aligning user-provided 2D sketches with their corresponding 3D keyposes and trajectories in a shared embedding space, enabling, for the first time, direct 2D control of motion generation. Our approach successfully transfers storyboards into high-quality 3D motions and inherently supports direct 3D animation editing, thanks to the flexibility of our multi-conditional motion generator. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zhongleilz.github.io/Sketch2Anim/</p></details> |

Recent advancements have positioned diffusion models as effective MDE tools by framing the challenge as a conditional image generation task. Despite their progress, these methods often struggle with accurately reconstructing distant depths, due largely to the imbalanced distribution of depth values and an over-reliance on spatial-domain features. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VistaDepth, a novel framework that integrates adaptive frequency-domain feature enhancements with an adaptive weight-balancing mechanism into the diffusion process. Central to our approach is the Latent Frequency Modulation (LFM) module, which dynamically refines spectral responses in the latent feature space, thereby improving the preservation of structural details and reducing noisy artifacts. Furthermore, we implement an adaptive weighting strategy that modulates the diffusion loss in real-time, enhancing the model's sensitivity towards distant depth reconstruction. These innovations collectively result in superior depth perception performance across both distance and detail. Experimental evaluations confirm that VistaDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion-based MDE techniques, particularly excelling in the accurate reconstruction of distant regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Our method generates Multiplane Images (MPIs) that ensure geometric consistency, making them ideal for immersive viewing experiences like binocular videos for VR headsets. Unlike existing methods that often require a separate stage or joint optimization to reconstruct a 3D representation (such as NeRF or 3D Gaussians), our approach directly generates the final output through a single denoising process, eliminating the need for post-processing steps to render novel views efficiently. To effectively learn from monocular videos, we introduce a training mechanism that reconstructs the output MPI randomly in either the target or the reference camera space. This approach enables the model to simultaneously learn sharp image details and underlying 3D information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves competitive avatar quality and novel-view rendering capabilities, even without explicit 3D reconstruction or high-quality multi-view training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025; project page: https://y-u-a-n-l-i.github.io/projects/IM-Portrait/</p></details> |

Previous studies rely on pre-defined action taxonomies or direct teleoperation to alleviate or circumvent these issues, often making them lack simplicity, versatility and scalability. Differently, we believe that the most effective and efficient way for teaching bimanual manipulation is learning from human demonstrated videos, where rich features such as spatial-temporal positions, dynamic postures, interaction states and dexterous transitions are available almost for free. In this work, we propose the YOTO (You Only Teach Once), which can extract and then inject patterns of bimanual actions from as few as a single binocular observation of hand movements, and teach dual robot arms various complex tasks. Furthermore, based on keyframes-based motion trajectories, we devise a subtle solution for rapidly generating training demonstrations with diverse variations of manipulated objects and their locations. These data can then be used to learn a customized bimanual diffusion policy (BiDP) across diverse scenes. In experiments, YOTO achieves impressive performance in mimicking 5 intricate long-horizon bimanual tasks, possesses strong generalization under different visual and spatial conditions, and outperforms existing visuomotor imitation learning methods in accuracy and efficiency.

The main challenges of this task lie on the insufficiency of high-quality paired stereo videos for training and the difficulty of maintaining the spatio-temporal consistency between frames. Existing methods primarily address these issues by directly applying novel view synthesis (NVS) techniques to video, while facing limitations such as the inability to effectively represent dynamic scenes and the requirement for large amounts of training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-supervised stereo video synthesis paradigm via a video diffusion model, termed SpatialDreamer, which meets the challenges head-on. Firstly, to address the stereo video data insufficiency, we propose a Depth based Video Generation module DVG, which employs a forward-backward rendering mechanism to generate paired videos with geometric and temporal priors. Leveraging data generated by DVG, we propose RefinerNet along with a self-supervised synthetic framework designed to facilitate efficient and dedicated training. More importantly, we devise a consistency control module, which consists of a metric of stereo deviation strength and a Temporal Interaction Learning module TIL for geometric and temporal consistency ensurance respectively. We evaluated the proposed method against various benchmark methods, with the results showcasing its superior performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website, see https://spatialdreamer.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing works still struggle to maintain consistency between the generated views and the input views, especially when there is a significant camera pose difference, leading to poor-quality 3D geometries and textures. We attribute this issue to their treatment of all target views with equal priority according to our empirical observation that the target views closer to the input views exhibit higher fidelity. With this inspiration, we propose AR-1-to-3, a novel next-view prediction paradigm based on diffusion models that first generates views close to the input views, which are then utilized as contextual information to progressively synthesize farther views. To encode the generated view subsequences as local and global conditions for the next-view prediction, we accordingly develop a stacked local feature encoding strategy (Stacked-LE) and an LSTM-based global feature encoding strategy (LSTM-GE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the consistency between the generated views and the input views, producing high-fidelity 3D assets.</p></details> |  |

However, demonstrations for contact-rich manipulation tasks that require complex coordination of multiple contacts are difficult to collect due to the limitations of current teleoperation interfaces. We investigate how to leverage model-based planning and optimization to generate training data for contact-rich dexterous manipulation tasks. Our analysis reveals that popular sampling-based planners like rapidly exploring random tree (RRT), while efficient for motion planning, produce demonstrations with unfavorably high entropy. This motivates modifications to our data generation pipeline that prioritizes demonstration consistency while maintaining solution diversity. Combined with a diffusion-based goal-conditioned BC approach, our method enables effective policy learning and zero-shot transfer to hardware for two challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Free-Mask: A Novel Paradigm of Integration Between the Segmentation Diffusion Model and Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01819v3)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current semantic segmentation models typically require a substantial amount of manually annotated data, a process that is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Alternatively, leveraging advanced text-to-image models such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has emerged as an efficient strategy, enabling the automatic generation of synthetic data in place of manual annotations. However, previous methods have been limited to generating single-instance images, as the generation of multiple instances with Stable Diffusion has proven unstable. To address this limitation and expand the scope and diversity of synthetic datasets, we propose a framework \textbf{Free-Mask} that combines a Diffusion Model for segmentation with advanced image editing capabilities, allowing for the integration of multiple objects into images via text-to-image models. Our method facilitates the creation of highly realistic datasets that closely emulate open-world environments while generating accurate segmentation masks. It reduces the labor associated with manual annotation and also ensures precise mask generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic data generated by \textbf{Free-Mask} enables segmentation models to outperform those trained on real data, especially in zero-shot settings.

This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality. Our code is open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/svg-project/Sparse-VideoGen</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Recent breakthroughs in foundation and diffusion models have reduced the time and cost of producing animated content. Characters are central animation components, involving motion, emotions, gestures, and facial expressions. The pace and breadth of advances in recent months make it difficult to maintain a coherent view of the field, motivating the need for an integrative review. Unlike earlier overviews that treat avatars, gestures, or facial animation in isolation, this survey offers a single, comprehensive perspective on all the main generative AI applications for character animation. We begin by examining the state-of-the-art in facial animation, expression rendering, image synthesis, avatar creation, gesture modeling, motion synthesis, object generation, and texture synthesis. We highlight leading research, practical deployments, commonly used datasets, and emerging trends for each area. To support newcomers, we also provide a comprehensive background section that introduces foundational models and evaluation metrics, equipping readers with the knowledge needed to enter the field.

However, existing training-based methods for layout pattern generation rely on large datasets. In practical scenarios, especially when developing a new technology node, obtaining such extensive layout data is challenging. Consequently, training models with large datasets becomes impractical, limiting the scalability and adaptability of prior approaches. To this end, we propose PatternPaint, a diffusion-based framework capable of generating legal patterns with limited design-rule-compliant training samples. PatternPaint simplifies complex layout pattern generation into a series of inpainting processes with a template-based denoising scheme. Furthermore, we perform few-shot finetuning on a pretrained image foundation model with only 20 design-rule-compliant samples. Experimental results show that using a sub-3nm technology node (Intel 18A), our model is the only one that can generate legal patterns in complex 2D metal interconnect design rule settings among all previous works and achieves a high diversity score. Additionally, our few-shot finetuning can boost the legality rate with 1.87X improvement compared to the original pretrained model. As a result, we demonstrate a production-ready approach for layout pattern generation in developing new technology nodes.</p></details> | DAC 2025 accepted |

These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 appendices (10 pages), 4 figures; https://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/compmech/pubs/currents.htm</p></details> |
| **[REED-VAE: RE-Encode Decode Training for Iterative Image Editing with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18989v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While latent diffusion models achieve impressive image editing results, their application to iterative editing of the same image is severely restricted. When trying to apply consecutive edit operations using current models, they accumulate artifacts and noise due to repeated transitions between pixel and latent spaces. Some methods have attempted to address this limitation by performing the entire edit chain within the latent space, sacrificing flexibility by supporting only a limited, predetermined set of diffusion editing operations. We present a RE-encode decode (REED) training scheme for variational autoencoders (VAEs), which promotes image quality preservation even after many iterations. Our work enables multi-method iterative image editing: users can perform a variety of iterative edit operations, with each operation building on the output of the previous one using both diffusion-based operations and conventional editing techniques. We demonstrate the advantage of REED-VAE across a range of image editing scenarios, including text-based and mask-based editing frameworks. In addition, we show how REED-VAE enhances the overall editability of images, increasing the likelihood of successful and precise edit operations. We hope that this work will serve as a benchmark for the newly introduced task of multi-method image editing.

| **[MRI super-resolution reconstruction using efficient diffusion probabilistic model with residual shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01576v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective:This study introduces a residual error-shifting mechanism that drastically reduces sampling steps while preserving critical anatomical details, thus accelerating MRI reconstruction. Approach:We propose a novel diffusion-based SR framework called Res-SRDiff, which integrates residual error shifting into the forward diffusion process. This enables efficient HR image reconstruction by aligning the degraded HR and LR distributions.We evaluated Res-SRDiff on ultra-high-field brain T1 MP2RAGE maps and T2-weighted prostate images, comparing it with Bicubic, Pix2pix, CycleGAN, and a conventional denoising diffusion probabilistic model with vision transformer backbone (TM-DDPM), using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). Main results: Res-SRDiff significantly outperformed all comparative methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and GMSD across both datasets, with statistically significant improvements (p-values<<0.05). The model achieved high-fidelity image restoration with only four sampling steps, drastically reducing computational time to under one second per slice, which is substantially faster than conventional TM-DDPM with around 20 seconds per slice. Qualitative analyses further demonstrated that Res-SRDiff effectively preserved fine anatomical details and lesion morphology in both brain and pelvic MRI images. Significance: Our findings show that Res-SRDiff is an efficient and accurate MRI SR method, markedly improving computational efficiency and image quality. Integrating residual error shifting into the diffusion process allows for rapid and robust HR image reconstruction, enhancing clinical MRI workflows and advancing medical imaging research.

| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> |  |

By first isolating only temporally novel objects with Mask R\-CNN, then guiding diffusion updates through hierarchical cross attention to object and global contexts, and finally categorizing each pixel into one of C change types, our method delivers detailed, interpretable multi\-class maps. It outperforms traditional differencing, Siamese CNNs, and GAN\-based detectors by 10\-25 points in F1 and IoU on both synthetic and real world benchmarks, marking a new state of the art in remote sensing change detection.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods suffer several drawbacks, such as requiring multi-view data, time-consuming per-scene optimization, distorted geometry in occluded areas, and low visual quality in backgrounds. Our novel 3D scene reconstruction pipeline overcomes these limitations to tackle the aforesaid challenge. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale reconstruction model that leverages latents from a video diffusion model to predict 3D Gaussian Splattings of scenes in a feed-forward manner. The video diffusion model is designed to create videos precisely following specified camera trajectories, allowing it to generate compressed video latents that encode multi-view information while maintaining 3D consistency. We train the 3D reconstruction model to operate on the video latent space with a progressive learning strategy, enabling the efficient generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes. Extensive evaluations across various datasets affirm that our model significantly outperforms existing single-view 3D scene generation methods, especially with out-of-domain images. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that a 3D reconstruction model can effectively be built upon the latent space of a diffusion model in order to realize efficient 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/wonderland/</p></details> |

Two estimators of linear functionals of $\mu_\phi $ based on the discretized Markov process are considered: a time-averaging estimator based on a single trajectory and an ensemble-averaging estimator based on multiple independent trajectories. Imposing no restrictions beyond a nominal level of smoothness on $\phi$, first-order error bounds, in discretization step size, on the bias and variance/mean-square error of both estimators are derived. The order of error matches the optimal rate in Euclidean and flat spaces, and leads to a first-order bound on distance between the invariant measure $\mu_\phi$ and a stationary measure of the discretized Markov process. This order is preserved even upon using retractions when exponential maps are unavailable in closed form, thus enhancing practicality of the proposed algorithms. Generality of the proof techniques, which exploit links between two partial differential equations and the semigroup of operators corresponding to the Langevin diffusion, renders them amenable for the study of a more general class of sampling algorithms related to the Langevin diffusion. Conditions for extending analysis to the case of non-compact manifolds are discussed. Numerical illustrations with distributions, log-concave and otherwise, on the manifolds of positive and negative curvature elucidate on the derived bounds and demonstrate practical utility of the sampling algorithm.</p></details> |  |

However, solutions often use the standard albeit computationally intensive route of training and inferring with the whole image on the diffusion prior. While patch-based approaches to evaluating diffusion priors in plug-and-play methods have received some interest, they remain an open area of study. In this work, we explore the feasibility of the usage of patches for training and inference of a diffusion prior on MRI images. We explore the minor adaptation necessary for artifact avoidance, the performance and the efficiency of memory usage of patch-based methods as well as the adaptability of whole image training to patch-based evaluation - evaluating across multiple plug-and-play methods, tasks and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium for Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2025</p></details> |

Numerous efforts employ generative models to generate high-fidelity, unlabeled 3D volumes across diverse modalities and anatomical regions. However, the intricate and indistinguishable anatomical structures within the abdomen pose a unique challenge to abdominal CT volume generation compared to other anatomical regions. To address the overlooked challenge, we introduce the Locality-Aware Diffusion (Lad), a novel method tailored for exquisite 3D abdominal CT volume generation. We design a locality loss to refine crucial anatomical regions and devise a condition extractor to integrate abdominal priori into generation, thereby enabling the generation of large quantities of high-quality abdominal CT volumes essential for SSL tasks without the need for additional data such as labels or radiology reports. Volumes generated through our method demonstrate remarkable fidelity in reproducing abdominal structures, achieving a decrease in FID score from 0.0034 to 0.0002 on AbdomenCT-1K dataset, closely mirroring authentic data and surpassing current methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in self-supervised organ segmentation tasks, resulting in an improvement in mean Dice scores on two abdominal datasets effectively. These results underscore the potential of synthetic data to advance self-supervised learning in medical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM 2024.

To address this problem, we propose U-Shape Mamba (USM), a novel diffusion model that leverages Mamba-based layers within a U-Net-like hierarchical structure. By progressively reducing sequence length in the encoder and restoring it in the decoder through Mamba blocks, USM significantly lowers computational overhead while maintaining strong generative capabilities. Experimental results against Zigma, which is currently the most efficient Mamba-based diffusion model, demonstrate that USM achieves one-third the GFlops, requires less memory and is faster, while outperforming Zigma in image quality. Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is improved by 15.3, 0.84 and 2.7 points on AFHQ, CelebAHQ and COCO datasets, respectively. These findings highlight USM as a highly efficient and scalable solution for diffusion-based generative models, making high-quality image synthesis more accessible to the research community while reducing computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 eLVM workshop.

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery platform for nucleic acids were used in the COVID-19 vaccines and have received much attention. While modern manufacturing processes which involve rapidly mixing an organic stream containing the lipids with an aqueous stream containing the nucleic acids are conceptually straightforward, detailed understanding of LNP formation and structure is still limited and scale-up can be challenging. Mathematical and computational methods are a promising avenue for deepening scientific understanding of the LNP formation process and facilitating improved process development and control. This article describes strategies for the mechanistic modeling of LNP formation, starting with strategies to estimate and predict important physicochemical properties of the various species such as diffusivities and solubilities. Subsequently, a framework is outlined for constructing mechanistic models of reactor- and particle-scale processes. Insights gained from the various models are mapped back to product quality attributes and process insights. Lastly, the use of the models to guide development of advanced process control and optimization strategies is discussed.</p></details> | 70 pages, 10 figures |

Existing solutions have tackled these challenges by optimizing the cross-attention mechanism or learning from the caption pairs with minimal semantic changes. However, can we generate high-quality complex contrastive images that diffusion models can directly discriminate based on visual representations? In this work, we leverage large-language models (LLMs) to compose realistic, complex scenarios and harness Visual-Question Answering (VQA) systems alongside diffusion models to automatically curate a contrastive dataset, ConPair, consisting of 15k pairs of high-quality contrastive images. These pairs feature minimal visual discrepancies and cover a wide range of attribute categories, especially complex and natural scenarios. To learn effectively from these error cases, i.e., hard negative images, we propose EvoGen, a new multi-stage curriculum for contrastive learning of diffusion models. Through extensive experiments across a wide range of compositional scenarios, we showcase the effectiveness of our proposed framework on compositional T2I benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose SCoPE (Scheduled interpolation of Coarse-to-fine Prompt Embeddings), a training-free method to improve text-to-image alignment by progressively refining the input prompt in a coarse-to-fine-grained manner. Given a detailed input prompt, we first decompose it into multiple sub-prompts which evolve from describing broad scene layout to highly intricate details. During inference, we interpolate between these sub-prompts and thus progressively introduce finer-grained details into the generated image. Our training-free plug-and-play approach significantly enhances prompt alignment, achieves an average improvement of up to +4% in Visual Question Answering (VQA) scores over the Stable Diffusion baselines on 85% of the prompts from the GenAI-Bench dataset.</p></details> |  |

While effective, these policies typically require a large number of trainable parameters. This model size affords powerful representations but also incurs high computational cost during training. Ideally, it would be beneficial to dynamically adjust the trainable portion as needed, balancing representational power with computational efficiency. For example, while overparameterization enables diffusion policies to capture complex robotic behaviors via offline behavioral cloning, the increased computational demand makes online interactive imitation learning impractical due to longer training time. To address this challenge, we present a framework, called DRIFT, that uses the Singular Value Decomposition to enable dynamic rank adjustment during diffusion policy training. We implement and demonstrate the benefits of this framework in DRIFT-DAgger, an imitation learning algorithm that can seamlessly slide between an offline bootstrapping phase and an online interactive phase. We perform extensive experiments to better understand the proposed framework, and demonstrate that DRIFT-DAgger achieves improved sample efficiency and faster training with minimal impact on model performance.

Nevertheless, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains a challenging task that has received significant attention in recent years. Specifically, OOD detection refers to the detection of instances that do not belong to the training distribution, while still having good performance on the in-distribution task (e.g., classification or object detection). Recent work has focused on generating synthetic outliers and using them to train an outlier detector, generally achieving improved OOD detection than traditional OOD methods. In this regard, outliers can be generated either in feature or pixel space. Feature space driven methods have shown strong performance on both the classification and object detection tasks, at the expense that the visualization of training outliers remains unknown, making further analysis on OOD failure modes challenging. On the other hand, pixel space outlier generation techniques enabled by diffusion models have been used for image classification using, providing improved OOD detection performance and outlier visualization, although their adaption to the object detection task is as yet unexplored. We therefore introduce Dream-Box, a method that provides a link to object-wise outlier generation in the pixel space for OOD detection. Specifically, we use diffusion models to generate object-wise outliers that are used to train an object detector for an in-distribution task and OOD detection. Our method achieves comparable performance to previous traditional methods while being the first technique to provide concrete visualization of generated OOD objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, LatinX in AI CVPR 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

However, before any forecast can begin, weather centers must identify the current atmospheric state from vast amounts of observational data. To address this challenging problem, we introduce Appa, a score-based data assimilation model producing global atmospheric trajectories at 0.25-degree resolution and 1-hour intervals. Powered by a 1.5B-parameter spatio-temporal latent diffusion model trained on ERA5 reanalysis data, Appa can be conditioned on any type of observations to infer the posterior distribution of plausible state trajectories, without retraining. Our unified probabilistic framework flexibly tackles multiple inference tasks -- reanalysis, filtering, and forecasting -- using the same model, eliminating the need for task-specific architectures or training procedures. Experiments demonstrate physical consistency on a global scale and good reconstructions from observations, while showing competitive forecasting skills. Our results establish latent score-based data assimilation as a promising foundation for future global atmospheric modeling systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReDistill: Residual Encoded Distillation for Peak Memory Reduction of CNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03744v3)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expansion of neural network sizes and the enhanced resolution of modern image sensors result in heightened memory and power demands to process modern computer vision models. In order to deploy these models in extremely resource-constrained edge devices, it is crucial to reduce their peak memory, which is the maximum memory consumed during the execution of a model. A naive approach to reducing peak memory is aggressive down-sampling of feature maps via pooling with large stride, which often results in unacceptable degradation in network performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose residual encoded distillation (ReDistill) for peak memory reduction in a teacher-student framework, in which a student network with less memory is derived from the teacher network using aggressive pooling. We apply our distillation method to multiple problems in computer vision, including image classification and diffusion-based image generation. For image classification, our method yields 4x-5x theoretical peak memory reduction with less degradation in accuracy for most CNN-based architectures. For diffusion-based image generation, our proposed distillation method yields a denoising network with 4x lower theoretical peak memory while maintaining decent diversity and fidelity for image generation. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to other feature-based and response-based distillation methods when applied to the same student network.

In this work, we enhance exploration through a two-fold approach within a hybrid framework that tackles both discrete and continuous action spaces. First, we model the continuous motion parameter policy as a diffusion model, and second, we incorporate this into a maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework that unifies both the discrete and continuous components. The discrete action space, such as contact point selection, is optimized through Q-value function maximization, while the continuous part is guided by a diffusion-based policy. This hybrid approach leads to a principled objective, where the maximum entropy term is derived as a lower bound using structured variational inference. We propose the Hybrid Diffusion Policy algorithm (HyDo) and evaluate its performance on both simulation and zero-shot sim2real tasks. Our results show that HyDo encourages more diverse behavior policies, leading to significantly improved success rates across tasks - for example, increasing from 53% to 72% on a real-world 6D pose alignment task.

The method combines explicit semantic correspondences with multi-view consistency to achieve precise and coherent stylization. Unlike conventional stylization methods that apply a reference style globally, ReStyle3D uses open-vocabulary segmentation to establish dense, instance-level correspondences between the style and real-world images. This ensures that each object is stylized with semantically matched textures. It first transfers the style to a single view using a training-free semantic-attention mechanism in a diffusion model. It then lifts the stylization to additional views via a learned warp-and-refine network guided by monocular depth and pixel-wise correspondences. Experiments show that ReStyle3D consistently outperforms prior methods in structure preservation, perceptual style similarity, and multi-view coherence. User studies further validate its ability to produce photo-realistic, semantically faithful results. Our code, pretrained models, and dataset will be publicly released, to support new applications in interior design, virtual staging, and 3D-consistent stylization.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH 2025.

This work adopts the novel SI time integrators from [44] for enhanced stability and extends the single-level SI-SDC method with a multilevel approach to increase computational efficiency. The favourable properties of the resulting SI-MLSDC method are shown by linear temporal stability analysis for a convection-diffusion problem. The robustness and efficiency of the fully discrete method involving a high-order discontinuous Galerkin SEM discretization are demonstrated through numerical experiments for the convection-diffusion, Burgers, Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. The method is shown to yield substantial reductions in fine-grid iterations compared to single-level SI-SDC across a broad range of test cases. Finally, current limitations of the SI-MLSDC framework are identified and discussed, providing guidance for future improvements.</p></details> |  |

However, its clinical utility is limited by technical challenges, including a low signal-to-noise ratio, aliasing artefacts, and the need for accurate quantitative fidelity. To address these limitations, we introduce RSFR (Reconstruction, Segmentation, Fusion & Refinement), a novel framework for cardiac diffusion-weighted image reconstruction. RSFR employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, leveraging zero-shot semantic priors via the Segment Anything Model and a robust Vision Mamba-based reconstruction backbone. Our framework integrates semantic features effectively to mitigate artefacts and enhance fidelity, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and accurate DT parameter estimation under high undersampling rates. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superior performance of RSFR compared to existing methods, highlighting its robustness, scalability, and potential for clinical translation in quantitative cardiac DTI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18506v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Instant Policy, which learns new tasks instantly (without further training) from just one or two demonstrations, achieving ICIL through two key components. First, we introduce inductive biases through a graph representation and model ICIL as a graph generation problem with a learned diffusion process, enabling structured reasoning over demonstrations, observations, and actions. Second, we show that such a model can be trained using pseudo-demonstrations - arbitrary trajectories generated in simulation - as a virtually infinite pool of training data. Simulated and real experiments show that Instant Policy enables rapid learning of various everyday robot tasks. We also show how it can serve as a foundation for cross-embodiment and zero-shot transfer to language-defined tasks.

However, acquiring HBP images requires prolonged scan times, which may compromise patient comfort and scanner throughput. In this study, we propose a deep learning based approach for synthesizing HBP images from earlier contrast phases (precontrast and transitional) and compare three generative models: a perceptual U-Net, a perceptual GAN (pGAN), and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). We curated a multi-site DCE-MRI dataset from diverse clinical settings and introduced a contrast evolution score (CES) to assess training data quality, enhancing model performance. Quantitative evaluation using pixel-wise and perceptual metrics, combined with qualitative assessment through blinded radiologist reviews, showed that pGAN achieved the best quantitative performance but introduced heterogeneous contrast in out-of-distribution cases. In contrast, the U-Net produced consistent liver enhancement with fewer artifacts, while DDPM underperformed due to limited preservation of fine structural details. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of synthetic HBP image generation as a means to reduce scan time without compromising diagnostic utility, highlighting the clinical potential of deep learning for dynamic contrast enhancement in liver MRI.

However, conventional methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset. We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation. Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis across datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future large-scale white matter shape analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

The challenge in this setting is that the models usually induce a joint distribution which is intractable. Resorting to instead sampling from the joint distribution by means of a Monte Carlo approach is also challenging. For example, a naive rejection sampling does not work when the probability mass of the constraint is zero. A typical example of such constrained problems is to learn energy consumption for a higher resolution level based on data at a lower resolution, e.g., to decompose a daily reading into readings at a finer level. We introduce a novel Monte Carlo sampling algorithm based on Langevin diffusions and rejection sampling to solve the problem of sampling from equality-constrained models. Our method has the advantage of being exact for linear constraints and naturally deals with multimodal distributions on arbitrary constraints. We test our method on statistical disaggregation problems for electricity consumption datasets, and our approach provides better uncertainty estimation and accuracy in data imputation compared with other naive/unconstrained methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 11 figures, to be published in Scandinavian Journal of Statistics</p></details> |

Our learning framework leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with only control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns the infinitesimal generator of a controlled stochastic diffusion in an infinite-dimensional hypothesis space. We demonstrate that our approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven solution to the optimal control problems. Furthermore, our learning framework includes nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled infinitesimal generators as a special case. Numerical experiments, ranging from synthetic differential equations to simulated robotic systems, showcase the advantages of our approach compared to both modern data-driven and classical nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at 7th Annual Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference (L4DC 2025)</p></details> |

Although HMDs provide joint signals from the head and hands, reconstructing a full-body pose remains challenging due to the unconstrained lower body. Recent advancements often rely on conventional neural networks and generative models to improve performance in this task, such as Transformers and diffusion models. However, these approaches struggle to strike a balance between achieving precise pose reconstruction and maintaining fast inference speed. To overcome these challenges, a lightweight and efficient model, SSD-Poser, is designed for robust full-body motion estimation from sparse observations. SSD-Poser incorporates a well-designed hybrid encoder, State Space Attention Encoders, to adapt the state space duality to complex motion poses and enable real-time realistic pose reconstruction. Moreover, a Frequency-Aware Decoder is introduced to mitigate jitter caused by variable-frequency motion signals, remarkably enhancing the motion smoothness. Comprehensive experiments on the AMASS dataset demonstrate that SSD-Poser achieves exceptional accuracy and computational efficiency, showing outstanding inference efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, conference ICMR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods often fail to incorporate adequate spatio-temporal modeling and prompt alignment within a unified framework, resulting in temporal inconsistencies, geometric distortions, or low-quality 4D content that deviates from the provided texts. Therefore, we propose STP4D, a novel approach that aims to integrate comprehensive spatio-temporal-prompt consistency modeling for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Specifically, STP4D employs three carefully designed modules: Time-varying Prompt Embedding, Geometric Information Enhancement, and Temporal Extension Deformation, which collaborate to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, STP4D is among the first methods to exploit the Diffusion model to generate 4D Gaussians, combining the fine-grained modeling capabilities and the real-time rendering process of 4DGS with the rapid inference speed of the Diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP4D excels in generating high-fidelity 4D content with exceptional efficiency (approximately 4.6s per asset), surpassing existing methods in both quality and speed.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, a significant challenge remains in applying these models for the more intricate task of story visualization. Since it requires resolving pronouns (he, she, they) in the frame descriptions, i.e., anaphora resolution, and ensuring consistent characters and background synthesis across frames. Yet, the emerging Large Language Model (LLM) showcases robust reasoning abilities to navigate through ambiguous references and process extensive sequences. Therefore, we introduce \emph{StoryGPT-V}, which leverages the merits of the latent diffusion (LDM) and LLM to produce images with consistent and high-quality characters grounded on given story descriptions. First, we train a character-aware LDM, which takes character-augmented semantic embedding as input and includes the supervision of the cross-attention map using character segmentation masks, aiming to enhance character generation accuracy and faithfulness. In the second stage, we enable an alignment between the output of LLM and the character-augmented embedding residing in the input space of the first-stage model. This harnesses the reasoning ability of LLM to address ambiguous references and the comprehension capability to memorize the context. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two visual story visualization benchmarks. Our model reports superior quantitative results and consistently generates accurate characters of remarkable quality with low memory consumption.

By combining the energy method with the coercivity of fractional derivatives, we convert the original partial differential equations into a coupled ordinary differential system. Through Laplace transform and maximum principle arguments, we reveal a dichotomy in decay behavior: When the highest fractional order is less than one, solutions exhibit sublinear decay, whereas systems with the highest order equal to one demonstrate a distinct superlinear decay pattern. This phenomenon fundamentally distinguishes coupled systems from single fractional diffusion equations, where such accelerated superlinear decay never occurs. Numerical experiments employing finite difference methods and implicit discretization schemes validate the theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The model couples a Fokker-Planck equation representing pedestrian density with a Hamilton-Jacobi-type (eikonal) equation. This Hughes model belongs to the class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems that often exhibit complex solution structures, including shocks and discontinuities. In this study, we assess the performance of three state-of-the-art neural operators (Fourier Neural Operator, Wavelet Neural Operator, and Multiwavelet Neural Operator) in various challenging scenarios. Specifically, we consider (1) discontinuous and Gaussian initial conditions and (2) diverse boundary conditions, while also examining the impact of different numerical schemes. Our results show that these neural operators perform well in easy scenarios with fewer discontinuities in the initial condition, yet they struggle in complex scenarios with multiple initial discontinuities and dynamic boundary conditions, even when trained specifically on such complex samples. The predicted solutions often appear smoother, resulting in a reduction in total variation and a loss of important physical features. This smoothing behavior is similar to issues discussed by Daganzo (1995), where models that introduce artificial diffusion were shown to miss essential features such as shock waves in hyperbolic systems. These results suggest that current neural operator architectures may introduce unintended regularization effects that limit their ability to capture transport dynamics governed by discontinuities. They also raise concerns about generalizing these methods to traffic applications where shock preservation is essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables, under review at Artificial Intelligence for Transportation | Journal</p></details> |

Observing this is a separable non-linear least-square problem which is linear w.r.t. the outer layer's weights, we consider a Variable Projection (VarPro) or two-timescale learning algorithm, thereby eliminating the linear variables and reducing the learning problem to the training of the feature distribution. Whereas most convergence rates or the training of neural networks rely on a neural tangent kernel analysis where features are fixed, we show such a strategy enables provable convergence rates for the sampling of a teacher feature distribution. Precisely, in the limit where the regularization strength vanishes, we show that the dynamic of the feature distribution corresponds to a weighted ultra-fast diffusion equation. Relying on recent results on the asymptotic behavior of such PDEs, we obtain guarantees for the convergence of the trained feature distribution towards the teacher feature distribution in a teacher-student setup.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, multi-round interactions are necessary to ensure the generated images meet expectations. Previous methods enhanced prompts via reward feedback but did not optimize over a multi-round dialogue dataset. In this work, we present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback, leveraging a well-trained reward model aligned with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, our framework applies multiple reward functions, such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback, while fine-tuning the diffusion model through LoRA, thus optimizing image generation based on user input. We also construct multi-round dialogue datasets of prompts and image pairs aligned with user intent. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly improving image consistency and alignment with user intent. Our approach consistently surpasses competing models in user satisfaction, especially in multi-turn dialogue scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.17660</p></details> |

Yet, the existing methods often produce stiff and unreasonable gestures with unseen human speech inputs due to the limited 3D speech-gesture data. In this paper, we propose CoCoGesture, a novel framework enabling vivid and diverse gesture synthesis from unseen human speech prompts. Our key insight is built upon the custom-designed pretrain-fintune training paradigm. At the pretraining stage, we aim to formulate a large generalizable gesture diffusion model by learning the abundant postures manifold. Therefore, to alleviate the scarcity of 3D data, we first construct a large-scale co-speech 3D gesture dataset containing more than 40M meshed posture instances across 4.3K speakers, dubbed GES-X. Then, we scale up the large unconditional diffusion model to 1B parameters and pre-train it to be our gesture experts. At the finetune stage, we present the audio ControlNet that incorporates the human voice as condition prompts to guide the gesture generation. Here, we construct the audio ControlNet through a trainable copy of our pre-trained diffusion model. Moreover, we design a novel Mixture-of-Gesture-Experts (MoGE) block to adaptively fuse the audio embedding from the human speech and the gesture features from the pre-trained gesture experts with a routing mechanism. Such an effective manner ensures audio embedding is temporal coordinated with motion features while preserving the vivid and diverse gesture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CoCoGesture outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the zero-shot speech-to-gesture generation.

While diffusion generative modeling relies on pre-training the score function $\nabla \log f_t$ using samples from $\pi$, SBTM addresses the more general and challenging setting where only $\nabla \log\pi$ is known. SBTM approximates the Wasserstein gradient flow on KL$(f_t\|\pi)$ by learning the time-varying score $\nabla \log f_t$ on the fly using score matching. The learned score gives immediate access to relative Fisher information, providing a built-in convergence diagnostic. The deterministic trajectories are smooth, interpretable, and free of Brownian-motion noise, while having the same distribution as ULA. We prove that SBTM dissipates relative entropy at the same rate as the exact gradient flow, provided sufficient training. We further extend our framework to annealed dynamics, to handle non log-concave targets. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings: SBTM converges at the optimal rate, has smooth trajectories, and is easily integrated with annealed dynamics. We compare to the baselines of ULA and annealed ULA.</p></details> |  |

We identify three critical limitations in current emotional talking head generation: insufficient utilization of audio's inherent emotional cues, identity leakage in emotion representations, and isolated learning of emotion correlations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework dubbed as DICE-Talk, following the idea of disentangling identity with emotion, and then cooperating emotions with similar characteristics. First, we develop a disentangled emotion embedder that jointly models audio-visual emotional cues through cross-modal attention, representing emotions as identity-agnostic Gaussian distributions. Second, we introduce a correlation-enhanced emotion conditioning module with learnable Emotion Banks that explicitly capture inter-emotion relationships through vector quantization and attention-based feature aggregation. Third, we design an emotion discrimination objective that enforces affective consistency during the diffusion process through latent-space classification. Extensive experiments on MEAD and HDTF datasets demonstrate our method's superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in emotion accuracy while maintaining competitive lip-sync performance. Qualitative results and user studies further confirm our method's ability to generate identity-preserving portraits with rich, correlated emotional expressions that naturally adapt to unseen identities.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.03270</p></details> |

Unlike the typical face swapping training process, which often relies on implicit supervision and struggles to achieve satisfactory results. DreamID establishes explicit supervision for face swapping by constructing Triplet ID Group data, significantly enhancing identity similarity and attribute preservation. The iterative nature of diffusion models poses challenges for utilizing efficient image-space loss functions, as performing time-consuming multi-step sampling to obtain the generated image during training is impractical. To address this issue, we leverage the accelerated diffusion model SD Turbo, reducing the inference steps to a single iteration, enabling efficient pixel-level end-to-end training with explicit Triplet ID Group supervision. Additionally, we propose an improved diffusion-based model architecture comprising SwapNet, FaceNet, and ID Adapter. This robust architecture fully unlocks the power of the Triplet ID Group explicit supervision. Finally, to further extend our method, we explicitly modify the Triplet ID Group data during training to fine-tune and preserve specific attributes, such as glasses and face shape. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of identity similarity, pose and expression preservation, and image fidelity. Overall, DreamID achieves high-quality face swapping results at 512*512 resolution in just 0.6 seconds and performs exceptionally well in challenging scenarios such as complex lighting, large angles, and occlusions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://superhero-7.github.io/DreamID/</p></details> |

While prior research has focused on image diffusion models (IDMs), video diffusion models (VDMs) remain underexplored. To address this gap, we first formally define the two types of memorization in VDMs (content memorization and motion memorization) in a practical way that focuses on privacy preservation and applies to all generation types. We then introduce new metrics specifically designed to separately assess content and motion memorization in VDMs. Additionally, we curate a dataset of text prompts that are most prone to triggering memorization when used as conditioning in VDMs. By leveraging these prompts, we generate diverse videos from various open-source VDMs, successfully extracting numerous training videos from each tested model. Through the application of our proposed metrics, we systematically analyze memorization across various pretrained VDMs, including text-conditional and unconditional models, on a variety of datasets. Our comprehensive study reveals that memorization is widespread across all tested VDMs, indicating that VDMs can also memorize image training data in addition to video datasets. Finally, we propose efficient and effective detection strategies for both content and motion memorization, offering a foundational approach for improving privacy in VDMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at DATA-FM Workshop @ ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, their inherent tendency to memorize and replicate training data during inference raises significant concerns, including potential copyright infringement. In response, various methods have been proposed to evaluate, detect, and mitigate memorization. Our analysis reveals that existing approaches significantly underperform in handling local memorization, where only specific image regions are memorized, compared to global memorization, where the entire image is replicated. Also, they cannot locate the local memorization regions, making it hard to investigate locally. To address these, we identify a novel "bright ending" (BE) anomaly in diffusion models prone to memorizing training images. BE refers to a distinct cross-attention pattern observed in text-to-image diffusion models, where memorized image patches exhibit significantly greater attention to the final text token during the last inference step than non-memorized patches. This pattern highlights regions where the generated image replicates training data and enables efficient localization of memorized regions. Equipped with this, we propose a simple yet effective method to integrate BE into existing frameworks, significantly improving their performance by narrowing the performance gap caused by local memorization. Our results not only validate the successful execution of the new localization task but also establish new state-of-the-art performance across all existing tasks, underscoring the significance of the BE phenomenon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 (Spotlight).

However, adapting on incoming site leads to catastrophic forgetting on past sites and decreases generalizablity on unseen sites. Existing Continual Learning (CL) and Domain Generalization (DG) methods have been proposed to solve these two challenges respectively, but none of them can address both simultaneously. Recognizing this limitation, this paper proposes a novel training paradigm, learning towards Synchronous Memorizability and Generalizability (SMG-Learning). To achieve this, we create the orientational gradient alignment to ensure memorizability on previous sites, and arbitrary gradient alignment to enhance generalizability on unseen sites. This approach is named as Parallel Gradient Alignment (PGA). Furthermore, we approximate the PGA as dual meta-objectives using the first-order Taylor expansion to reduce computational cost of aligning gradients. Considering that performing gradient alignments, especially for previous sites, is not feasible due to the privacy constraints, we design a Site-Modulated Diffusion (SMD) model to generate images with site-specific learnable prompts, replaying images have similar data distributions as previous sites. We evaluate our method on two medical image segmentation tasks, where data from different sites arrive sequentially. Experimental results show that our method efficiently enhances both memorizability and generalizablity better than other state-of-the-art methods, delivering satisfactory performance across all sites. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/dyxu-cuhkcse/SMG-Learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is not proper to be published on arXiv, since we think some method are quite similar with one other paper</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Privacy-Utility Trade-offs to Mitigate Memorization in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18032v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in creating images highly aligned with user prompts, yet their proclivity for memorizing training set images has sparked concerns about the originality of the generated images and privacy issues, potentially leading to legal complications for both model owners and users, particularly when the memorized images contain proprietary content. Although methods to mitigate these issues have been suggested, enhancing privacy often results in a significant decrease in the utility of the outputs, as indicated by text-alignment scores. To bridge the research gap, we introduce a novel method, PRSS, which refines the classifier-free guidance approach in diffusion models by integrating prompt re-anchoring (PR) to improve privacy and incorporating semantic prompt search (SS) to enhance utility. Extensive experiments across various privacy levels demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the privacy-utility trade-off, establishing a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025.

| **[Diffusion-Driven Universal Model Inversion Attack for Face Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18015v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial recognition technology poses significant privacy risks, as it relies on biometric data that is inherently sensitive and immutable if compromised. To mitigate these concerns, face recognition systems convert raw images into embeddings, traditionally considered privacy-preserving. However, model inversion attacks pose a significant privacy threat by reconstructing these private facial images, making them a crucial tool for evaluating the privacy risks of face recognition systems. Existing methods usually require training individual generators for each target model, a computationally expensive process. In this paper, we propose DiffUMI, a training-free diffusion-driven universal model inversion attack for face recognition systems. DiffUMI is the first approach to apply a diffusion model for unconditional image generation in model inversion. Unlike other methods, DiffUMI is universal, eliminating the need for training target-specific generators. It operates within a fixed framework and pretrained diffusion model while seamlessly adapting to diverse target identities and models. DiffUMI breaches privacy-preserving face recognition systems with state-of-the-art success, demonstrating that an unconditional diffusion model, coupled with optimized adversarial search, enables efficient and high-fidelity facial reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce a novel application of out-of-domain detection (OODD), marking the first use of model inversion to distinguish non-face inputs from face inputs based solely on embeddings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Importance-Based Token Merging for Efficient Image and Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16720v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Token merging can effectively accelerate various vision systems by processing groups of similar tokens only once and sharing the results across them. However, existing token grouping methods are often ad hoc and random, disregarding the actual content of the samples. We show that preserving high-information tokens during merging - those essential for semantic fidelity and structural details - significantly improves sample quality, producing finer details and more coherent, realistic generations. Despite being simple and intuitive, this approach remains underexplored. To do so, we propose an importance-based token merging method that prioritizes the most critical tokens in computational resource allocation, leveraging readily available importance scores, such as those from classifier-free guidance in diffusion models. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple applications, including text-to-image synthesis, multi-view image generation, and video generation with various model architectures such as Stable Diffusion, Zero123++, AnimateDiff, or PixArt-$\alpha$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Video Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00200v3)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A unified video and action model holds significant promise for robotics, where videos provide rich scene information for action prediction, and actions provide dynamics information for video prediction. However, effectively combining video generation and action prediction remains challenging, and current video generation-based methods struggle to match the performance of direct policy learning in action accuracy and inference speed. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unified Video Action model (UVA), which jointly optimizes video and action predictions to achieve both high accuracy and efficient action inference. The key lies in learning a joint video-action latent representation and decoupling video-action decoding. The joint latent representation bridges the visual and action domains, effectively modeling the relationship between video and action sequences. Meanwhile, the decoupled decoding, powered by two lightweight diffusion heads, enables high-speed action inference by bypassing video generation during inference. Such a unified framework further enables versatile functionality through masked input training. By selectively masking actions or videos, a single model can tackle diverse tasks beyond policy learning, such as forward and inverse dynamics modeling and video generation. Via an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that UVA can serve as a general-purpose solution for a wide range of robotics tasks, such as policy learning, forward/inverse dynamics and video observation prediction, without compromising performance compared to methods tailored for specific applications.

| **[DCT-Shield: A Robust Frequency Domain Defense against Malicious Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17894v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in diffusion models have enabled effortless image editing via text prompts, raising concerns about image security. Attackers with access to user images can exploit these tools for malicious edits. Recent defenses attempt to protect images by adding a limited noise in the pixel space to disrupt the functioning of diffusion-based editing models. However, the adversarial noise added by previous methods is easily noticeable to the human eye. Moreover, most of these methods are not robust to purification techniques like JPEG compression under a feasible pixel budget. We propose a novel optimization approach that introduces adversarial perturbations directly in the frequency domain by modifying the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of the input image. By leveraging the JPEG pipeline, our method generates adversarial images that effectively prevent malicious image editing. Extensive experiments across a variety of tasks and datasets demonstrate that our approach introduces fewer visual artifacts while maintaining similar levels of edit protection and robustness to noise purification techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Consistency in Diffusion Models for Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13807v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods exploit the powerful text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models for real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) and achieve impressive results compared to previous models. However, we observe two kinds of inconsistencies in diffusion-based methods which hinder existing models from fully exploiting diffusion priors. The first is the semantic inconsistency arising from diffusion guidance. T2I generation focuses on semantic-level consistency with text prompts, while Real-ISR emphasizes pixel-level reconstruction from low-quality (LQ) images, necessitating more detailed semantic guidance from LQ inputs. The second is the training-inference inconsistency stemming from the DDPM, which improperly assumes high-quality (HQ) latent corrupted by Gaussian noise as denoising inputs for each timestep. To address these issues, we introduce ConsisSR to handle both semantic and training-inference consistencies. On the one hand, to address the semantic inconsistency, we proposed a Hybrid Prompt Adapter (HPA). Instead of text prompts with coarse-grained classification information, we leverage the more powerful CLIP image embeddings to explore additional color and texture guidance. On the other hand, we introduce Time-Aware Latent Augmentation (TALA) to bridge the training-inference inconsistency. Based on the probability function p(t), we accordingly enhance the SDSR training strategy. With LQ latent with Gaussian noise as inputs, our TALA not only focuses on diffusion noise but also refine the LQ latent towards the HQ counterpart. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among existing diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Fixed Topologies: Unregistered Training and Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics for 3D Talking Heads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11041v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating speech-driven 3D talking heads presents numerous challenges; among those is dealing with varying mesh topologies where no point-wise correspondence exists across all meshes the model can animate. While simplifying the problem, it limits applicability as unseen meshes must adhere to the training topology. This work presents a framework capable of animating 3D faces in arbitrary topologies, including real scanned data. Our approach relies on a model leveraging heat diffusion to predict features robust to the mesh topology. We explore two training settings: a registered one, in which meshes in a training sequences share a fixed topology but any mesh can be animated at test time, and an fully unregistered one, which allows effective training with varying mesh structures. Additionally, we highlight the limitations of current evaluation metrics and propose new metrics for better lip-syncing evaluation between speech and facial movements. Our extensive evaluation shows our approach performs favorably compared to fixed topology techniques, setting a new benchmark by offering a versatile and high-fidelity solution for 3D talking head generation where the topology constraint is dropped.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://fedenoce.github.io/scantalk/</p></details> |

The latest works addressing scene completion with diffusion models tackle this problem by reformulating the original DDPM as a local diffusion process. It contrasts with the common practice of operating at the level of objects, where vanilla DDPMs are currently used. In this work, we close the gap between these two lines of work. We identify approximations in the local diffusion formulation, show that they are not required to operate at the scene level, and that a vanilla DDPM with a well-chosen starting point is enough for completion. Finally, we demonstrate that our method, LiDPM, leads to better results in scene completion on SemanticKITTI.

By initializing from multimodal Generative PreTraining (mGPT), we demonstrate that decoder-only Autoregressive (AR) model can achieve image generation performance comparable to modern diffusion models with high efficiency through Flexible Progressive Supervised Fine-tuning (FP-SFT). Equipped with our proposed Unambiguous image Representation (UniRep), Lumina-mGPT can flexibly generate high-quality images of varying aspect ratios. Building on the strong image generation capabilities, we further explore Ominiponent Supervised Fine-tuning (Omni-SFT), an initial attempt to elevate Lumina-mGPT into a unified multi-modal generalist. The resulting model demonstrates versatile multimodal capabilities, including visual generation tasks like text-to-image/multiview generation and controllable generation, visual recognition tasks like segmentation and depth estimation, and vision-language tasks like multi-turn visual question answering, showing the rosy potential of the technical direction.

| **[Weak-to-Strong Diffusion with Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00473v3)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of diffusion generative models is to align the learned distribution with the real data distribution through gradient score matching. However, inherent limitations in training data quality, modeling strategies, and architectural design lead to inevitable gap between generated outputs and real data. To reduce this gap, we propose Weak-to-Strong Diffusion (W2SD), a novel framework that utilizes the estimated difference between existing weak and strong models (i.e., weak-to-strong difference) to bridge the gap between an ideal model and a strong model. By employing a reflective operation that alternates between denoising and inversion with weak-to-strong difference, we theoretically understand that W2SD steers latent variables along sampling trajectories toward regions of the real data distribution. W2SD is highly flexible and broadly applicable, enabling diverse improvements through the strategic selection of weak-to-strong model pairs (e.g., DreamShaper vs. SD1.5, good experts vs. bad experts in MoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that W2SD significantly improves human preference, aesthetic quality, and prompt adherence, achieving SOTA performance across various modalities (e.g., image, video), architectures (e.g., UNet-based, DiT-based, MoE), and benchmarks. For example, Juggernaut-XL with W2SD can improve with the HPSv2 winning rate up to 90% over the original results. Moreover, the performance gains achieved by W2SD markedly outweigh its additional computational overhead, while the cumulative improvements from different weak-to-strong difference further solidify its practical utility and deployability.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 23 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Learning with Synthetic Positives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16965v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning with the nearest neighbor has proved to be one of the most efficient self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques by utilizing the similarity of multiple instances within the same class. However, its efficacy is constrained as the nearest neighbor algorithm primarily identifies "easy" positive pairs, where the representations are already closely located in the embedding space. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Contrastive Learning with Synthetic Positives (CLSP) that utilizes synthetic images, generated by an unconditional diffusion model, as the additional positives to help the model learn from diverse positives. Through feature interpolation in the diffusion model sampling process, we generate images with distinct backgrounds yet similar semantic content to the anchor image. These images are considered "hard" positives for the anchor image, and when included as supplementary positives in the contrastive loss, they contribute to a performance improvement of over 2% and 1% in linear evaluation compared to the previous NNCLR and All4One methods across multiple benchmark datasets such as CIFAR10, achieving state-of-the-art methods. On transfer learning benchmarks, CLSP outperforms existing SSL frameworks on 6 out of 8 downstream datasets. We believe CLSP establishes a valuable baseline for future SSL studies incorporating synthetic data in the training process.</p></details> | 8 pages, conference |

Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for their intrinsic structural flexibility.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces the Attention Diffusion Zero-shot Unsupervised System (ADZUS), a novel text-guided diffusion model that performs wound segmentation without relying on labeled training data. Unlike conventional deep learning models, which require extensive annotation, ADZUS leverages zero-shot learning to dynamically adapt segmentation based on descriptive prompts, offering enhanced flexibility and adaptability in clinical applications. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ADZUS surpasses traditional and state-of-the-art segmentation models, achieving an IoU of 86.68\% and the highest precision of 94.69\% on the chronic wound dataset, outperforming supervised approaches such as FUSegNet. Further validation on a custom-curated DFU dataset reinforces its robustness, with ADZUS achieving a median DSC of 75\%, significantly surpassing FUSegNet's 45\%. The model's text-guided segmentation capability enables real-time customization of segmentation outputs, allowing targeted analysis of wound characteristics based on clinical descriptions. Despite its competitive performance, the computational cost of diffusion-based inference and the need for potential fine-tuning remain areas for future improvement. ADZUS represents a transformative step in wound segmentation, providing a scalable, efficient, and adaptable AI-driven solution for medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, journal article</p></details> |
| **[TarDiff: Target-Oriented Diffusion Guidance for Synthetic Electronic Health Record Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17613v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series generation is crucial for advancing clinical machine learning models, as it helps address data scarcity by providing more training data. However, most existing approaches focus primarily on replicating statistical distributions and temporal dependencies of real-world data. We argue that fidelity to observed data alone does not guarantee better model performance, as common patterns may dominate, limiting the representation of rare but important conditions. This highlights the need for generate synthetic samples to improve performance of specific clinical models to fulfill their target outcomes. To address this, we propose TarDiff, a novel target-oriented diffusion framework that integrates task-specific influence guidance into the synthetic data generation process. Unlike conventional approaches that mimic training data distributions, TarDiff optimizes synthetic samples by quantifying their expected contribution to improving downstream model performance through influence functions. Specifically, we measure the reduction in task-specific loss induced by synthetic samples and embed this influence gradient into the reverse diffusion process, thereby steering the generation towards utility-optimized data. Evaluated on six publicly available EHR datasets, TarDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by up to 20.4% in AUPRC and 18.4% in AUROC. Our results demonstrate that TarDiff not only preserves temporal fidelity but also enhances downstream model performance, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and class imbalance in healthcare analytics.</p></details> |  |

GCL approaches can be categorized into augmentation-based and augmentation-free methods. The former relies on complex data augmentations, while the latter depends on encoders that can generate distinct views of the same input. Both approaches may require negative samples for training. In this paper, we introduce a novel augmentation-free GCL framework based on graph neural diffusion models. Specifically, we utilize learnable encoders governed by Fractional Differential Equations (FDE). Each FDE is characterized by an order parameter of the differential operator. We demonstrate that varying these parameters allows us to produce learnable encoders that generate diverse views, capturing either local or global information, for contrastive learning. Our model does not require negative samples for training and is applicable to both homophilic and heterophilic datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | Submitted to ICML |
| **[Fast Autoregressive Models for Continuous Latent Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18391v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models have demonstrated remarkable success in sequential data generation, particularly in NLP, but their extension to continuous-domain image generation presents significant challenges. Recent work, the masked autoregressive model (MAR), bypasses quantization by modeling per-token distributions in continuous spaces using a diffusion head but suffers from slow inference due to the high computational cost of the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose the Fast AutoRegressive model (FAR), a novel framework that replaces MAR's diffusion head with a lightweight shortcut head, enabling efficient few-step sampling while preserving autoregressive principles. Additionally, FAR seamlessly integrates with causal Transformers, extending them from discrete to continuous token generation without requiring architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that FAR achieves $2.3\times$ faster inference than MAR while maintaining competitive FID and IS scores. This work establishes the first efficient autoregressive paradigm for high-fidelity continuous-space image generation, bridging the critical gap between quality and scalability in visual autoregressive modeling.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods primarily utilize information from adjacent pixels for reconstructing missing areas, while they struggle to preserve complex details and structures. Simultaneously, models based on deep learning necessitate substantial amounts of training data. To address this challenge, an encoding strategy-inspired diffusion model with few-shot learning for color image inpainting is proposed in this paper. The main idea of this novel encoding strategy is the deployment of a "virtual mask" to construct high-dimensional objects through mutual perturbations between channels. This approach enables the diffusion model to capture diverse image representations and detailed features from limited training samples. Moreover, the encoding strategy leverages redundancy between channels, integrates with low-rank methods during iterative inpainting, and incorporates the diffusion model to achieve accurate information output. Experimental results indicate that our method exceeds current techniques in quantitative metrics, and the reconstructed images quality has been improved in aspects of texture and structural integrity, leading to more precise and coherent results.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages,10 figures,Submit to tcsvt</p></details> |

However, due to the complex and diverse pathological features of medical images and the imbalanced class distribution in medical data, generating high-quality and diverse medical images from limited data is significantly challenging. Additionally, to fully leverage the information in limited data, such as anatomical structure information and generate more structurally stable medical images while avoiding distortion or inconsistency. In this paper, in order to enhance the clinical relevance of generated data and improve the interpretability of the model, we propose a novel medical image generation framework, which generates independent pathological and structural features based on causal disentanglement and utilizes text-guided modeling of pathological features to regulate the generation of counterfactual images. First, we achieve feature separation through causal disentanglement and analyze the interactions between features. Here, we introduce group supervision to ensure the independence of pathological and identity features. Second, we leverage a diffusion model guided by pathological findings to model pathological features, enabling the generation of diverse counterfactual images. Meanwhile, we enhance accuracy by leveraging a large language model to extract lesion severity and location from medical reports. Additionally, we improve the performance of the latent diffusion model on long-tailed categories through initial noise optimization.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods struggle to generate high-quality and temporally consistent results when handling complex clothing patterns and diverse body poses. We present 3DV-TON, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating high-fidelity and temporally consistent video try-on results. Our approach employs generated animatable textured 3D meshes as explicit frame-level guidance, alleviating the issue of models over-focusing on appearance fidelity at the expanse of motion coherence. This is achieved by enabling direct reference to consistent garment texture movements throughout video sequences. The proposed method features an adaptive pipeline for generating dynamic 3D guidance: (1) selecting a keyframe for initial 2D image try-on, followed by (2) reconstructing and animating a textured 3D mesh synchronized with original video poses. We further introduce a robust rectangular masking strategy that successfully mitigates artifact propagation caused by leaking clothing information during dynamic human and garment movements. To advance video try-on research, we introduce HR-VVT, a high-resolution benchmark dataset containing 130 videos with diverse clothing types and scenarios.

It aims to synthesize images tailored to individual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances, layout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by leveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite notable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large language models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately capture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular, the state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual features, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to preserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics. To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image generation framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation Composition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic intentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form user-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs. Specifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement learning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style and semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with difficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which applies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled representations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while effectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance of disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective personalized image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyper-Transforming Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16580v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel generative framework for functions by integrating Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Transformer-based hypernetworks into latent variable models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on MLP-based hypernetworks with scalability limitations, our method employs a Transformer-based decoder to generate INR parameters from latent variables, addressing both representation capacity and computational efficiency. Our framework extends latent diffusion models (LDMs) to INR generation by replacing standard decoders with a Transformer-based hypernetwork, which can be trained either from scratch or via hyper-transforming-a strategy that fine-tunes only the decoder while freezing the pre-trained latent space. This enables efficient adaptation of existing generative models to INR-based representations without requiring full retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalized and Training-Free Text-Guided Semantic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17269v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided semantic manipulation refers to semantically editing an image generated from a source prompt to match a target prompt, enabling the desired semantic changes (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) while preserving irrelevant contents. With the powerful generative capabilities of the diffusion model, the task has shown the potential to generate high-fidelity visual content. Nevertheless, existing methods either typically require time-consuming fine-tuning (inefficient), fail to accomplish multiple semantic manipulations (poorly extensible), and/or lack support for different modality tasks (limited generalizability). Upon further investigation, we find that the geometric properties of noises in the diffusion model are strongly correlated with the semantic changes. Motivated by this, we propose a novel $\textit{GTF}$ for text-guided semantic manipulation, which has the following attractive capabilities: 1) $\textbf{Generalized}$: our $\textit{GTF}$ supports multiple semantic manipulations (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) and can be seamlessly integrated into all diffusion-based methods (i.e., Plug-and-play) across different modalities (i.e., modality-agnostic); and 2) $\textbf{Training-free}$: $\textit{GTF}$ produces high-fidelity results via simply controlling the geometric relationship between noises without tuning or optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, highlighting its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in semantics manipulation.</p></details> |  |

This paper studies the problem of leveraging pretrained diffusion models for performing discriminative tasks. Specifically, we extend the discriminative capability of pretrained frozen generative diffusion models from the classification task to the more complex object detection task, by "inverting" a pretrained layout-to-image diffusion model. To this end, a gradient-based discrete optimization approach for replacing the heavy prediction enumeration process, and a prior distribution model for making more accurate use of the Bayes' rule, are proposed respectively. Empirical results show that this method is on par with basic discriminative object detection baselines on COCO dataset. In addition, our method can greatly speed up the previous diffusion-based method for classification without sacrificing accuracy.

To address these challenges, we introduce OmegAMP, a framework that leverages a diffusion-based generative model with efficient low-dimensional embeddings, precise controllability mechanisms, and novel classifiers with drastically reduced false positive rates for candidate filtering. OmegAMP enables the targeted generation of AMPs with specific physicochemical properties, activity profiles, and species-specific effectiveness. Moreover, it maximizes sample diversity while ensuring faithfulness to the underlying data distribution during generation. We demonstrate that OmegAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance across all stages of the AMP discovery pipeline, significantly advancing the potential of computational frameworks in combating antimicrobial resistance.</p></details> |  |

We utilize the geometric products between Clifford multivectors and the rich geometric information encoded in Clifford subspaces in \emph{Clifford Diffusion Models} (CDMs). We extend the diffusion process beyond just Clifford one-vectors to incorporate all higher-grade multivector subspaces. The data is embedded in grade-$k$ subspaces, allowing us to apply latent diffusion across complete multivectors. This enables CDMs to capture the joint distribution across different subspaces of the algebra, incorporating richer geometric information through higher-order features. We provide empirical results for unconditional molecular generation on the QM9 dataset, showing that CDMs provide a promising avenue for generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Variational Autoencoders with Smooth Robust Latent Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17219v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have played a key role in scaling up diffusion-based generative models, as in Stable Diffusion, yet questions regarding their robustness remain largely underexplored. Although adversarial training has been an established technique for enhancing robustness in predictive models, it has been overlooked for generative models due to concerns about potential fidelity degradation by the nature of trade-offs between performance and robustness. In this work, we challenge this presumption, introducing Smooth Robust Latent VAE (SRL-VAE), a novel adversarial training framework that boosts both generation quality and robustness. In contrast to conventional adversarial training, which focuses on robustness only, our approach smooths the latent space via adversarial perturbations, promoting more generalizable representations while regularizing with originality representation to sustain original fidelity. Applied as a post-training step on pre-trained VAEs, SRL-VAE improves image robustness and fidelity with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show that SRL-VAE improves both generation quality, in image reconstruction and text-guided image editing, and robustness, against Nightshade attacks and image editing attacks. These results establish a new paradigm, showing that adversarial training, once thought to be detrimental to generative models, can instead enhance both fidelity and robustness.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Diffusion Models Are Real-Time Game Engines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14837v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GameNGen, the first game engine powered entirely by a neural model that also enables real-time interaction with a complex environment over long trajectories at high quality. When trained on the classic game DOOM, GameNGen extracts gameplay and uses it to generate a playable environment that can interactively simulate new trajectories. GameNGen runs at 20 frames per second on a single TPU and remains stable over extended multi-minute play sessions. Next frame prediction achieves a PSNR of 29.4, comparable to lossy JPEG compression. Human raters are only slightly better than random chance at distinguishing short clips of the game from clips of the simulation, even after 5 minutes of auto-regressive generation. GameNGen is trained in two phases: (1) an RL-agent learns to play the game and the training sessions are recorded, and (2) a diffusion model is trained to produce the next frame, conditioned on the sequence of past frames and actions. Conditioning augmentations help ensure stable auto-regressive generation over long trajectories, and decoder fine-tuning improves the fidelity of visual details and text.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

This paper presents a physics-informed generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) for synthesizing feasible power flow data. By incorporating auxiliary training and physics-informed loss functions, the proposed method ensures that the generated data exhibit both statistical fidelity and adherence to power system feasibility. We evaluate the approach on the IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus benchmark systems, demonstrating its ability to capture key distributional properties and generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios. Comparative results show that the proposed model outperforms three baseline models in terms of feasibility, diversity, and accuracy of statistical features.

| **[Dual Prompting Image Restoration with Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17825v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent state-of-the-art image restoration methods mostly adopt latent diffusion models with U-Net backbones, yet still facing challenges in achieving high-quality restoration due to their limited capabilities. Diffusion transformers (DiTs), like SD3, are emerging as a promising alternative because of their better quality with scalability. In this paper, we introduce DPIR (Dual Prompting Image Restoration), a novel image restoration method that effectivly extracts conditional information of low-quality images from multiple perspectives. Specifically, DPIR consits of two branches: a low-quality image conditioning branch and a dual prompting control branch. The first branch utilizes a lightweight module to incorporate image priors into the DiT with high efficiency. More importantly, we believe that in image restoration, textual description alone cannot fully capture its rich visual characteristics. Therefore, a dual prompting module is designed to provide DiT with additional visual cues, capturing both global context and local appearance. The extracted global-local visual prompts as extra conditional control, alongside textual prompts to form dual prompts, greatly enhance the quality of the restoration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DPIR delivers superior image restoration performance.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |

However, even when trained using millions of miles of real-world data, AVs are often unable to detect rare failure modes (RFMs). The problem of RFMs is commonly referred to as the "long-tail challenge", due to the distribution of data including many instances that are very rarely seen. In this paper, we present a novel approach that utilizes advanced generative and explainable AI techniques to aid in understanding RFMs. Our methods can be used to enhance the robustness and reliability of AVs when combined with both downstream model training and testing. We extract segmentation masks for objects of interest (e.g., cars) and invert them to create environmental masks. These masks, combined with carefully crafted text prompts, are fed into a custom diffusion model. We leverage the Stable Diffusion inpainting model guided by adversarial noise optimization to generate images containing diverse environments designed to evade object detection models and expose vulnerabilities in AI systems. Finally, we produce natural language descriptions of the generated RFMs that can guide developers and policymakers to improve the safety and reliability of AV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures.

Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Diffuse Domain Approximation with Transmission-Type Boundary Conditions I: Asymptotic Analysis and Numerics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07007v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffuse domain methods (DDMs) have garnered significant attention for approximating solutions to partial differential equations on complex geometries. These methods implicitly represent the geometry by replacing the sharp boundary interface with a diffuse layer of thickness $\varepsilon$, which scales with the minimum grid size. This approach reformulates the original equations on an extended regular domain, incorporating boundary conditions through singular source terms. In this work, we conduct a matched asymptotic analysis of a DDM for a two-sided problem with transmission-type Robin boundary conditions. Our results show that, in the one dimensional space, the solution of the diffuse domain approximation asymptotically converges to the solution of the original problem, with exactly first-order accuracy in $\varepsilon$. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations that validate and illustrate the analytical result.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Entropy Stable Formulation of Two-equation Turbulence Models with Particular Reference to the k-epsilon Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17110v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistency and stability are two essential ingredients in the design of numerical algorithms for partial differential equations. Robust algorithms can be developed by incorporating nonlinear physical stability principles in their design, such as the entropy production inequality (i.e., the Clausius-Duhem inequality or second law of thermodynamics), rather than by simply adding artificial viscosity (a common approach). This idea is applied to the k-epsilon and two-equation turbulence models by introducing space-time averaging. Then, a set of entropy variables can be defined which leads to a symmetric system of advective-diffusive equations. Positivity and symmetry of the equations require certain constraints on the turbulence diffusivity coefficients and the turbulence source terms. With these, we are able to design entropy producing two-equation turbulence models and, in particular, the k-epsilon model.</p></details> | 50 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Physics-guided and fabrication-aware inverse design of photonic devices using diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17077v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing free-form photonic devices is fundamentally challenging due to the vast number of possible geometries and the complex requirements of fabrication constraints. Traditional inverse-design approaches--whether driven by human intuition, global optimization, or adjoint-based gradient methods--often involve intricate binarization and filtering steps, while recent deep learning strategies demand prohibitively large numbers of simulations (10^5 to 10^6). To overcome these limitations, we present AdjointDiffusion, a physics-guided framework that integrates adjoint sensitivity gradients into the sampling process of diffusion models. AdjointDiffusion begins by training a diffusion network on a synthetic, fabrication-aware dataset of binary masks. During inference, we compute the adjoint gradient of a candidate structure and inject this physics-based guidance at each denoising step, steering the generative process toward high figure-of-merit (FoM) solutions without additional post-processing. We demonstrate our method on two canonical photonic design problems--a bent waveguide and a CMOS image sensor color router--and show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art nonlinear optimizers (such as MMA and SLSQP) in both efficiency and manufacturability, while using orders of magnitude fewer simulations (approximately 2 x 10^2) than pure deep learning approaches (approximately 10^5 to 10^6). By eliminating complex binarization schedules and minimizing simulation overhead, AdjointDiffusion offers a streamlined, simulation-efficient, and fabrication-aware pipeline for next-generation photonic device design. Our open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/dongjin-seo2020/AdjointDiffusion.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 Figures |

Remote sensing provides high data accuracy and enables large-scale observations. Optical images facilitate long-term monitoring, which is crucial for future carbon stock estimation studies. This study focuses on Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China, utilizing GF-1 WFV satellite imagery. The KD-VGG and KD-UNet modules were introduced for initial feature extraction, and the improved implicit diffusion model (IIDM) was proposed. The results showed: (1) The VGG module improved initial feature extraction, improving accuracy, and reducing inference time with optimized model parameters. (2) The Cross-attention + MLPs module enabled effective feature fusion, establishing critical relationships between global and local features, achieving high-accuracy estimation. (3) The IIDM model, a novel contribution, demonstrated the highest estimation accuracy with an RMSE of 12.17%, significantly improving by 41.69% to 42.33% compared to the regression model. In carbon stock estimation, the generative model excelled in extracting deeper features, significantly outperforming other models, demonstrating the feasibility of AI-generated content in quantitative remote sensing. The 16-meter resolution estimates provide a robust basis for tailoring forest carbon sink regulations, enhancing regional carbon stock management.</p></details> |  |

Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem, which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence, and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal, we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current operational state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a workshop paper in "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning", ICLR 2025 Workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning. https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/iclr2025/12</p></details> |

The \textit{manifold hypothesis} states that high-dimensional data often lie on lower-dimensional manifolds within the ambient space, and is widely believed to hold in provided examples. While recent results have provided invaluable insight into how diffusion models adapt to the manifold hypothesis, they do not capture the great empirical success of these models, making this a very fruitful research direction. In this work, we study DDPMs under the manifold hypothesis and prove that they achieve rates independent of the ambient dimension in terms of score learning. In terms of sampling complexity, we obtain rates independent of the ambient dimension w.r.t. the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and $O(\sqrt{D})$ w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance. We do this by developing a new framework connecting diffusion models to the well-studied theory of extrema of Gaussian Processes.</p></details> |  |

Synthetic datasets are often used for training, yet the domain gap limits generalization to real data. We propose a novel image-to-image translation framework that preserves structure while generating realistic textures from clinical data. Our key innovation integrates Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, conditioned on a latent representation extracted from a Per-Pixel Shading (PPS) map. PPS captures surface lighting effects, providing a stronger structural constraint than depth maps. Experiments show our approach produces more realistic translations and improves depth estimation over GAN-based MI-CycleGAN.

In many applications, this distribution is believed to concentrate on a much lower $d$-dimensional manifold embedded into $D$-dimensional space; this is known as the manifold hypothesis. The current best-known convergence guarantees are either linear in $D$ or polynomial (superlinear) in $d$. The latter exploits a novel integration scheme for the backward SDE. We take the best of both worlds and show that the number of steps diffusion models require in order to converge in Kullback-Leibler~(KL) divergence is linear (up to logarithmic terms) in the intrinsic dimension $d$. Moreover, we show that this linear dependency is sharp.</p></details> |  |

However, such brain information is often scarce, expensive, and difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose the first approach capable of generating synthetic brain MRI segmentations -- specifically, 3D white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) segmentations -- for individuals using their easily obtainable and often readily available demographic, interview, and cognitive test information. Our approach features a novel deep generative model, CSegSynth, which outperforms existing prominent generative models, including conditional variational autoencoder (C-VAE), conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN), and conditional latent diffusion model (C-LDM). We demonstrate the high quality of our synthetic segmentations through extensive evaluations. Also, in assessing the effectiveness of the individual-specific generation, we achieve superior volume prediction, with mean absolute errors of only 36.44mL, 29.20mL, and 35.51mL between the ground-truth WM, GM, and CSF volumes of test individuals and those volumes predicted based on generated individual-specific segmentations, respectively.</p></details> |  |
