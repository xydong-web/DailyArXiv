| **[MolGA: Molecular Graph Adaptation with Pre-trained 2D Graph Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07289v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular graph representation learning is widely used in chemical and biomedical research. While pre-trained 2D graph encoders have demonstrated strong performance, they overlook the rich molecular domain knowledge associated with submolecular instances (atoms and bonds). While molecular pre-training approaches incorporate such knowledge into their pre-training objectives, they typically employ designs tailored to a specific type of knowledge, lacking the flexibility to integrate diverse knowledge present in molecules. Hence, reusing widely available and well-validated pre-trained 2D encoders, while incorporating molecular domain knowledge during downstream adaptation, offers a more practical alternative. In this work, we propose MolGA, which adapts pre-trained 2D graph encoders to downstream molecular applications by flexibly incorporating diverse molecular domain knowledge. First, we propose a molecular alignment strategy that bridge the gap between pre-trained topological representations with domain-knowledge representations. Second, we introduce a conditional adaptation mechanism that generates instance-specific tokens to enable fine-grained integration of molecular domain knowledge for downstream tasks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on eleven public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MolGA.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[SubGrapher: Visual Fingerprinting of Chemical Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19695v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic extraction of chemical structures from scientific literature plays a crucial role in accelerating research across fields ranging from drug discovery to materials science. Patent documents, in particular, contain molecular information in visual form, which is often inaccessible through traditional text-based searches. In this work, we introduce SubGrapher, a method for the visual fingerprinting of chemical structure images. Unlike conventional Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) models that attempt to reconstruct full molecular graphs, SubGrapher focuses on extracting molecular fingerprints directly from chemical structure images. Using learning-based instance segmentation, SubGrapher identifies functional groups and carbon backbones, constructing a substructure-based fingerprint that enables chemical structure retrieval. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art OCSR and fingerprinting methods, demonstrating superior retrieval performance and robustness across diverse molecular depictions. The dataset, models, and code are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Now UKAN!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11200v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional multilayer perceptrons. However, their reliance on predefined, bounded grids restricts their ability to approximate functions on unbounded domains. To address this, we present Unbounded Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (UKANs), a method that removes the need for bounded grids in traditional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The key innovation of this method is a coefficient-generator (CG) model that produces, on the fly, only the B-spline coefficients required locally on an unbounded symmetric grid. UKANs couple multilayer perceptrons with KANs by feeding the positional encoding of grid groups into the CG model, enabling function approximation on unbounded domains without requiring data normalization. To reduce the computational cost of both UKANs and KANs, we introduce a GPU-accelerated library that lowers B-spline evaluation complexity by a factor proportional to the grid size, enabling large-scale learning by leveraging efficient memory management, in line with recent software advances such as FlashAttention and FlashFFTConv. Performance benchmarking confirms the superior memory and computational efficiency of our accelerated KAN (warpKAN), and UKANs, showing a 3-30x speed-up and up to 1000x memory reduction compared to vanilla KANs. Experiments on regression, classification, and generative tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of UKANs to match or surpass KAN accuracy. Finally, we use both accelerated KAN and UKAN in a molecular property prediction task, establishing the feasibility of large-scale end-to-end training with our optimized implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Unified Molecule Pre-training with Flexible 2D and 3D Modalities: Single and Paired Modality Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07035v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in advancing applications such as drug discovery and material design. Existing work leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training, aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However, these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically, inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/tewiSong/FlexMol.</p></details> | CIKM 2025 |
| **[GROMACS Unplugged: How Power Capping and Frequency Shapes Performance on GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06902v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular dynamics simulations are essential tools in computational biophysics, but their performance depend heavily on hardware choices and configuration. In this work, we presents a comprehensive performance analysis of four NVIDIA GPU accelerators -- A40, A100, L4, and L40 -- using six representative GROMACS biomolecular workloads alongside two synthetic benchmarks: Pi Solver (compute bound) and STREAM Triad (memory bound). We investigate how performance scales with GPU graphics clock frequency and how workloads respond to power capping. The two synthetic benchmarks define the extremes of frequency scaling: Pi Solver shows ideal compute scalability, while STREAM Triad reveals memory bandwidth limits -- framing GROMACS's performance in context. Our results reveal distinct frequency scaling behaviors: Smaller GROMACS systems exhibit strong frequency sensitivity, while larger systems saturate quickly, becoming increasingly memory bound. Under power capping, performance remains stable until architecture- and workload-specific thresholds are reached, with high-end GPUs like the A100 maintaining near-maximum performance even under reduced power budgets. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting GPU hardware and optimizing GROMACS performance for large-scale MD workflows under power constraints.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[ExLLM: Experience-Enhanced LLM Optimization for Molecular Design and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12845v4)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular design involves an enormous and irregular search space, where traditional optimizers such as Bayesian optimization, genetic algorithms, and generative models struggle to leverage expert knowledge or handle complex feedback. Recently, LLMs have been used as optimizers, achieving promising results on benchmarks such as PMO. However, existing approaches rely only on prompting or extra training, without mechanisms to handle complex feedback or maintain scalable memory. In particular, the common practice of appending or summarizing experiences at every query leads to redundancy, degraded exploration, and ultimately poor final outcomes under large-scale iterative search. We introduce ExLLM (Experience-Enhanced LLM optimization), an LLM-as-optimizer framework with three components: (1) a compact, evolving experience snippet tailored to large discrete spaces that distills non-redundant cues and improves convergence at low cost; (2) a simple yet effective k-offspring scheme that widens exploration per call and reduces orchestration cost; and (3) a lightweight feedback adapter that normalizes objectives for selection while formatting constraints and expert hints for iteration. ExLLM sets new state-of-the-art results on PMO and generalizes strongly in our setup, it sets records on circle packing and stellarator design, and yields consistent gains across additional domains requiring only a task-description template and evaluation functions to transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, under review</p></details> |
| **[MultiCNKG: Integrating Cognitive Neuroscience, Gene, and Disease Knowledge Graphs Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06742v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) in biomedical and cognitive sciences, overcoming limitations in traditional machine learning methods for capturing intricate semantic links among genes, diseases, and cognitive processes. We introduce MultiCNKG, an innovative framework that merges three key knowledge sources: the Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graph (CNKG) with 2.9K nodes and 4.3K edges across 9 node types and 20 edge types; Gene Ontology (GO) featuring 43K nodes and 75K edges in 3 node types and 4 edge types; and Disease Ontology (DO) comprising 11.2K nodes and 8.8K edges with 1 node type and 2 edge types. Leveraging LLMs like GPT-4, we conduct entity alignment, semantic similarity computation, and graph augmentation to create a cohesive KG that interconnects genetic mechanisms, neurological disorders, and cognitive functions. The resulting MultiCNKG encompasses 6.9K nodes across 5 types (e.g., Genes, Diseases, Cognitive Processes) and 11.3K edges spanning 7 types (e.g., Causes, Associated with, Regulates), facilitating a multi-layered view from molecular to behavioral domains. Assessments using metrics such as precision (85.20%), recall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), graph consistency (82.50%), novelty detection (40.28%), and expert validation (89.50%) affirm its robustness and coherence. Link prediction evaluations with models like TransE (MR: 391, MRR: 0.411) and RotatE (MR: 263, MRR: 0.395) show competitive performance against benchmarks like FB15k-237 and WN18RR. This KG advances applications in personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis formulation in cognitive neuroscience.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Inertial Langevin Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06723v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel method for drawing samples from Gibbs distributions with densities of the form $\pi(x) \propto \exp(-U(x))$. The method accelerates the unadjusted Langevin algorithm by introducing an inertia term similar to Polyak's heavy ball method, together with a corresponding noise rescaling. Interpreting the scheme as a discretization of \emph{kinetic} Langevin dynamics, we prove ergodicity (in continuous and discrete time) for twice continuously differentiable, strongly convex, and $L$-smooth potentials and bound the bias of the discretization to the target in Wasserstein-2 distance. In particular, the presented proofs allow for smaller friction parameters in the kinetic Langevin diffusion compared to existing literature. Moreover, we show the close ties of the proposed method to the over-relaxed Gibbs sampler. The scheme is tested in an extensive set of numerical experiments covering simple toy examples, total variation image denoising, and the complex task of maximum likelihood learning of an energy-based model for molecular structure generation. The experimental results confirm the acceleration provided by the proposed scheme even beyond the strongly convex and $L$-smooth setting.</p></details> |  |

| **[HOG-Diff: Higher-Order Guided Diffusion for Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04308v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph generation is a critical yet challenging task as empirical analyses require a deep understanding of complex, non-Euclidean structures. Diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, but these models are typically adapted from image generation frameworks and overlook inherent higher-order topology, leaving them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff), a principled framework that progressively generates plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. HOG-Diff follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum guided by higher-order topology and implemented via diffusion bridges. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiminghh/HOG-Diff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow-Matching Based Refiner for Molecular Conformer Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04878v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-energy molecular conformers generation (MCG) is a foundational yet challenging problem in drug discovery. Denoising-based methods include diffusion and flow-matching methods that learn mappings from a simple base distribution to the molecular conformer distribution. However, these approaches often suffer from error accumulation during sampling, especially in the low SNR steps, which are hard to train. To address these challenges, we propose a flow-matching refiner for the MCG task. The proposed method initializes sampling from mixed-quality outputs produced by upstream denoising models and reschedules the noise scale to bypass the low-SNR phase, thereby improving sample quality. On the GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs benchmark datasets, the generator-refiner pipeline improves quality with fewer total denoising steps while preserving diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frame-based Equivariant Diffusion Models for 3D Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19506v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity, we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention. On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale, alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of global structure preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive Feature Caching for Training-free Acceleration of Molecular Geometry Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04646v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching models generate high-fidelity molecular geometries but incur significant computational costs during inference, requiring hundreds of network evaluations. This inference overhead becomes the primary bottleneck when such models are employed in practice to sample large numbers of molecular candidates. This work discusses a training-free caching strategy that accelerates molecular geometry generation by predicting intermediate hidden states across solver steps. The proposed method operates directly on the SE(3)-equivariant backbone, is compatible with pretrained models, and is orthogonal to existing training-based accelerations and system-level optimizations. Experiments on the GEOM-Drugs dataset demonstrate that caching achieves a twofold reduction in wall-clock inference time at matched sample quality and a speedup of up to 3x compared to the base model with minimal sample quality degradation. Because these gains compound with other optimizations, applying caching alongside other general, lossless optimizations yield as much as a 7x speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AI for Science Workshop @ NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Controlled Generation with Equivariant Variational Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18340v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models, or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolLangBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Language-Prompted Molecular Structure Recognition, Editing, and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15054v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise recognition, editing, and generation of molecules are essential prerequisites for both chemists and AI systems tackling various chemical tasks. We present MolLangBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate fundamental molecule-language interface tasks: language-prompted molecular structure recognition, editing, and generation. To ensure high-quality, unambiguous, and deterministic outputs, we construct the recognition tasks using automated cheminformatics tools, and curate editing and generation tasks through rigorous expert annotation and validation. MolLangBench supports the evaluation of models that interface language with different molecular representations, including linear strings, molecular images, and molecular graphs. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal significant limitations: the strongest model (GPT-5) achieves $86.2\%$ and $85.5\%$ accuracy on recognition and editing tasks, which are intuitively simple for humans, and performs even worse on the generation task, reaching only $43.0\%$ accuracy. These results highlight the shortcomings of current AI systems in handling even preliminary molecular recognition and manipulation tasks. We hope MolLangBench will catalyze further research toward more effective and reliable AI systems for chemical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Template-Guided 3D Molecular Pose Generation via Flow Matching and Differentiable Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06305v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the 3D conformation of small molecules within protein binding sites is a key challenge in drug design. When a crystallized reference ligand (template) is available, it provides geometric priors that can guide 3D pose prediction. We present a two-stage method for ligand conformation generation guided by such templates. In the first stage, we introduce a molecular alignment approach based on flow-matching to generate 3D coordinates for the ligand, using the template structure as a reference. In the second stage, a differentiable pose optimization procedure refines this conformation based on shape and pharmacophore similarities, internal energy, and, optionally, the protein binding pocket. We introduce a new benchmark of ligand pairs co-crystallized with the same target to evaluate our approach and show that it outperforms standard docking tools and open-access alignment methods, especially in cases involving low similarity to the template or high ligand flexibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mol-LLaMA: Towards General Understanding of Molecules in Large Molecular Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13449v5)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding molecules is key to understanding organisms and driving advances in drug discovery, requiring interdisciplinary knowledge across chemistry and biology. Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in task transfer, they often struggle to accurately analyze molecular features due to limited knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this issue, we present Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules and exhibits explainability and reasoning ability. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental molecular features, taking into account the essential abilities for molecular reasoning. Further, to improve molecular understanding, we propose a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and providing informative responses, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.

| **[Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01902v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g., program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample -- while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that approximate the LM's distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding Evolutionary Molecular Design: Adding Reinforcement Learning for Mutation Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00802v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient exploration of chemical space remains a central challenge, as many generative models still produce unstable or non-synthesizable compounds. To address these limitations, we present EvoMol-RL, a significant extension of the EvoMol evolutionary algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning to guide molecular mutations based on local structural context. By leveraging Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs), EvoMol-RL learns context-aware mutation policies that prioritize chemically plausible transformations. This approach significantly improves the generation of valid and realistic molecules, reducing the frequency of structural artifacts and enhancing optimization performance. The results demonstrate that EvoMol-RL consistently outperforms its baseline in molecular pre-filtering realism. These results emphasize the effectiveness of combining reinforcement learning with molecular fingerprints to generate chemically relevant molecular structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Accepted for publication in the proceedings of ICTAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[MarS-FM: Generative Modeling of Molecular Dynamics via Markov State Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24779v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues) with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events, and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing methods, often by a substantial margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature-aware Hypergraph Generation via Next-Scale Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01467v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph generative models have shown strong results in molecular design but struggle to scale to large, complex structures. While hierarchical methods improve scalability, they usually ignore node and edge features, which are critical in real-world applications. This issue is amplified in hypergraphs, where hyperedges capture higher-order relationships among multiple nodes. Despite their importance in domains such as 3D geometry, molecular systems, and circuit design, existing generative models rarely support both hypergraphs and feature generation at scale. In this paper, we introduce FAHNES (feature-aware hypergraph generation via next-scale prediction), a hierarchical framework that jointly generates hypergraph topology and features. FAHNES builds multi-scale representations through node coarsening and refines them via localized expansion, guided by a novel node budget mechanism that controls granularity and ensures consistency across scales. Experiments on synthetic, 3D mesh and graph point cloud datasets show that FAHNES achieves state-of-the-art performance in jointly generating features and structure, advancing scalable hypergraph and graph generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Solutions to the Quantum Schrödinger Bridge Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25980v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that, similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions, we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework, and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings, including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation and applications in Mean-Field Games.</p></details> |  |
| **[Composable Score-based Graph Diffusion Model for Multi-Conditional Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09451v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints. While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration (PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for flexible, multi-property molecular design.</p></details> |  |
| **[DEMO:Diffusion-based Evolutionary Optimization for 3D Multi-Objective Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11037v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing multiple objective properties while satisfying structural constraints is a major challenge in 3D molecular discovery. This difficulty arises because optimization objectives can be non-differentiable and the structure-property relationship is often unknown. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are widely used for multi-objective optimization to find Pareto fronts and can naturally handle structural constraints without any explicit modelling; however, in the 3D molecular space they lack mechanisms to guarantee chemical validity and are therefore prone to producing invalid structures. Conversely, diffusion models excel at generating chemically valid 3D molecules but typically require modifying the model and retraining to incorporate structural constraints. Moreover, diffusion models are not inherently designed for direct multi-objective optimization and struggle to explore the Pareto front of the learned property distribution - a critical capability for discovering novel, high-performing molecules. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel 3D molecular multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that leverages the generative power of a pretrained diffusion model. Instead of manipulating molecules directly in the complex chemical space, our method performs crossover operations in the noise space defined by the diffusion model's forward process, thereby enabling parental features or desired fragments to be fused into offspring. The pretrained model's denoising process then restores structural validity. The approach is highly composable and, requiring no retraining, can be readily integrated with existing guidance methods to improve discovery. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance on single-objective, multi-objective, and structurally constrained optimization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In this version, we thoroughly revised the paper: redesigned motivation, all experiments (design, fairness, ablation), added algorithmic details, mathematical analysis, and supplementary experiments in the appendix</p></details> |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism, implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves original feature information through residual connections, which is critical for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint was submitted to IEEE TrustCom 2025.

Adaptive meshes improve computational efficiency by refining resolution in critical regions, but typically require task-specific heuristics or cumbersome manual design by a human expert. We propose Adaptive Meshing By Expert Reconstruction (AMBER), a supervised learning approach to mesh adaptation. Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e., a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes. AMBER generalizes to unseen geometries and consistently outperforms multiple recent baselines, including ones using Graph and Convolutional Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS2025</p></details> |
| **[GNN-enhanced Traffic Anomaly Detection for Next-Generation SDN-Enabled Consumer Electronics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07109v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consumer electronics (CE) connected to the Internet of Things are susceptible to various attacks, including DDoS and web-based threats, which can compromise their functionality and facilitate remote hijacking. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to exploit CE for broader system attacks while enabling the propagation of malicious code across the CE network, resulting in device failures. Existing deep learning-based traffic anomaly detection systems exhibit high accuracy in traditional network environments but are often overly complex and reliant on static infrastructure, necessitating manual configuration and management. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable network model that integrates Software-defined Networking (SDN) and Compute First Networking (CFN) for next-generation CE networks. In this network model, we propose a Graph Neural Networks-based Network Anomaly Detection framework (GNN-NAD) that integrates SDN-based CE networks and enables the CFN architecture. GNN-NAD uniquely fuses a static, vulnerability-aware attack graph with dynamic traffic features, providing a holistic view of network security. The core of the framework is a GNN model (GSAGE) for graph representation learning, followed by a Random Forest (RF) classifier. This design (GSAGE+RF) demonstrates superior performance compared to existing feature selection methods. Experimental evaluations on CE environment reveal that GNN-NAD achieves superior metrics in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, even with small sample sizes, exceeding the performance of current network anomaly detection methods. This work advances the security and efficiency of next-generation intelligent CE networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics. 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Graph Condensation: Advancing Data Versatility through Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17063v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing computation of training graph neural networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs, graph condensation (GC) has emerged as a promising solution to synthesize a compact, substitute graph of the large-scale original graph for efficient GNN training. However, existing GC methods predominantly employ classification as the surrogate task for optimization, thus excessively relying on node labels and constraining their utility in label-sparsity scenarios. More critically, this surrogate task tends to overfit class-specific information within the condensed graph, consequently restricting the generalization capabilities of GC for other downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce Contrastive Graph Condensation (CTGC), which adopts a self-supervised surrogate task to extract critical, causal information from the original graph and enhance the cross-task generalizability of the condensed graph. Specifically, CTGC employs a dual-branch framework to disentangle the generation of the node attributes and graph structures, where a dedicated structural branch is designed to explicitly encode geometric information through nodes' positional embeddings. By implementing an alternating optimization scheme with contrastive loss terms, CTGC promotes the mutual enhancement of both branches and facilitates high-quality graph generation through the model inversion technique. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CTGC excels in handling various downstream tasks with a limited number of labels, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art GC methods.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |
| **[Revisiting Node Affinity Prediction in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06940v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS - Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising, training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is available at https://github.com/orfeld415/NAVIS</p></details> | preprint |

Algorithms are integral to robotics and safety-critical applications due to their predictable and consistent performance through logical and mathematical principles. In contrast, while neural networks are highly adaptable, handling complex, high-dimensional data and generalising across tasks, they often lack interpretability and transparency in their internal computations. To bridge the two, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, NAR-*ICP, that learns the intermediate computations of classical ICP-based registration algorithms, extending the CLRS Benchmark. We evaluate our approach across real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating its flexibility in handling complex inputs, and its potential to be used within larger learning pipelines. Our method achieves superior performance compared to the baselines, even surpassing the algorithms it was trained on, further demonstrating its ability to generalise beyond the capabilities of traditional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 16 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce MoRE-GNN (Multi-omics Relational Edge Graph Neural Network), a heterogeneous graph autoencoder that combines graph convolution and attention mechanisms to dynamically construct relational graphs directly from data. Evaluations on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that MoRE-GNN captures biologically meaningful relationships and outperforms existing methods, particularly in settings with strong inter-modality correlations. Furthermore, the learned representations allow for accurate downstream cross-modal predictions. While performance may vary with dataset complexity, MoRE-GNN offers an adaptive, scalable and interpretable framework for advancing multi-omics integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalization of Graph Neural Networks for AC Optimal Power Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06860v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale power systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times. Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to 10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical, generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print has been submitted for review</p></details> |

We propose a novel integration framework that enables effective fusion between powerful pre-trained text encoders and Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs). Our method enhances the alignment of textual and structural representations through a bidirectional fusion mechanism and contrastive node-level optimization. To evaluate the approach, we train two variants using different PLMs: Snowflake-Embed (state-of-the-art) and GTE-base, each paired with an R-GCN backbone. Experiments on five heterophilic benchmarks demonstrate that our integration method achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, surpassing existing GNN and large language model-based approaches. Notably, Snowflake-Embed + R-GCN improves accuracy on the Texas dataset by over 8\% and on Wisconsin by nearly 5\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our fusion strategy for advancing text-rich graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-Aware Compound-Protein Affinity Prediction via Graph Neural Network with Group Lasso Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03318v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end explainable models for structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as the limited number of compound-protein interaction activity data for specific protein targets, and plenty of subtle changes in molecular configuration sites significantly affecting molecular properties. We exploit pairs of molecules with activity cliffs that share scaffolds but differ at substituent sites, characterized by large potency differences for specific protein targets. We propose a framework by implementing graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage property and structure information from activity cliff pairs to predict compound-protein affinity (i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). To enhance model performance and explainability, we train GNNs with structure-aware loss functions using group lasso and sparse group lasso regularizations, which prune and highlight molecular subgraphs relevant to activity differences. We applied this framework to activity cliff data of molecules targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (PDB IDs: 1O42, 2H8H, 4MXO). Our approach improved property prediction by integrating common and uncommon node information with sparse group lasso, as reflected in reduced root mean squared error (RMSE) and improved Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). Applying regularizations also enhances feature attribution for GNN by boosting graph-level global direction scores and improving atom-level coloring accuracy. These advances strengthen model interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly for identifying critical molecular substructures in lead optimization.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Spatiotemporal Graph Learning with Direct Volumetric Information Passing and Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18013v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven learning of physical systems has kindled significant attention, where many neural models have been developed. In particular, mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in modeling spatiotemporal dynamics across arbitrary geometric domains. However, the existing node-edge message-passing and aggregation mechanism in GNNs limits the representation learning ability. In this paper, we proposed a dual-module framework, Cell-embedded and Feature-enhanced Graph Neural Network (aka, CeFeGNN), for learning spatiotemporal dynamics. Specifically, we embed learnable cell attributions to the common node-edge message passing process, which better captures the spatial dependency of regional features. Such a strategy essentially upgrades the local aggregation scheme from first order (e.g., from edge to node) to a higher order (e.g., from volume and edge to node), which takes advantage of volumetric information in message passing. Meanwhile, a novel feature-enhanced block is designed to further improve the model's performance and alleviate the over-smoothness problem. Extensive experiments on various PDE systems and one real-world dataset demonstrate that CeFeGNN achieves superior performance compared with other baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing the Effect of Embedding Norms and Singular Values to Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06066v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e., adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size (i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds. This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of the GNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey of Mamba Architectures for Medical Image Analysis: Classification, Segmentation, Restoration and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02362v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a special case of the State Space Model, is gaining popularity as an alternative to template-based deep learning approaches in medical image analysis. While transformers are powerful architectures, they have drawbacks, including quadratic computational complexity and an inability to address long-range dependencies efficiently. This limitation affects the analysis of large and complex datasets in medical imaging, where there are many spatial and temporal relationships. In contrast, Mamba offers benefits that make it well-suited for medical image analysis. It has linear time complexity, which is a significant improvement over transformers. Mamba processes longer sequences without attention mechanisms, enabling faster inference and requiring less memory. Mamba also demonstrates strong performance in merging multimodal data, improving diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes. The organization of this paper allows readers to appreciate the capabilities of Mamba in medical imaging step by step. We begin by defining core concepts of SSMs and models, including S4, S5, and S6, followed by an exploration of Mamba architectures such as pure Mamba, U-Net variants, and hybrid models with convolutional neural networks, transformers, and Graph Neural Networks. We also cover Mamba optimizations, techniques and adaptations, scanning, datasets, applications, experimental results, and conclude with its challenges and future directions in medical imaging. This review aims to demonstrate the transformative potential of Mamba in overcoming existing barriers within medical imaging while paving the way for innovative advancements in the field. A comprehensive list of Mamba architectures applied in the medical field, reviewed in this work, is available at Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[A comprehensive comparison of neural operators for 3D industry-scale engineering designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05995v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning nonlinear mappings between function spaces, enabling real-time prediction of complex dynamics in diverse scientific and engineering applications. With their growing adoption in engineering design evaluation, a wide range of neural operator architectures have been proposed for various problem settings. However, model selection remains challenging due to the absence of fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address this, we propose and standardize six representative 3D industry-scale engineering design datasets spanning thermal analysis, linear elasticity, elasto-plasticity, time-dependent plastic problems, and computational fluid dynamics. All datasets include fully preprocessed inputs and outputs for model training, making them directly usable across diverse neural operator architectures. Using these datasets, we conduct a systematic comparison of four types of neural operator variants, including Branch-Trunk-based Neural Operators inspired by DeepONet, Graph-based Neural Operators inspired by Graph Neural Networks, Grid-based Neural Operators inspired by Fourier Neural Operators, and Point-based Neural Operators inspired by PointNet. We further introduce practical enhancements to adapt these models to different engineering settings, improving the fairness of the comparison. Our benchmarking study evaluates each model strengths and limitations in terms of predictive performance, computational efficiency, memory usage, and deployment complexity. The findings provide actionable insights to guide future neural operator development.</p></details> |  |

While NLI has developed many sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm: CDCL-NLI, which extends traditional NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 25,410 instances and spanning 26 languages. To address the limitations of previous methods on CDCL-NLI task, we further propose an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion with interpretability-aware prediction. Our approach leverages RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) within heterogeneous graph neural networks for cross-document context modeling, and employs a structure-aware semantic alignment based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI interpretability, we develop an EDU (Elementary Discourse Unit)-level attribution framework that produces extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both conventional NLI models as well as large language models. Our work sheds light on the study of NLI and will bring research interest on cross-document cross-lingual context understanding, hallucination elimination and interpretability inference.

| **[Uncertainty assessment in satellite-based greenhouse gas emissions estimates using emulated atmospheric transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05751v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales. However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their associated uncertainty. We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport "footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole fractions. While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks Truly Effective? A Causal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05750v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly, aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However, whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21 datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses, with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/YXNTU/CausalHGNN.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design. Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world datasets, as quantum resources mature.

| **[Inductive inference of gradient-boosted decision trees on graphs for insurance fraud detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05676v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies. That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine (G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world, proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights into the predictions made by G-GBM.</p></details> |  |

Current generative depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent space, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details. Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

Among these top-down influences, language plays a crucial role in guiding attention by shaping how visual information is interpreted. Existing methods primarily focus on modeling perceptual information while neglecting the reasoning process facilitated by language, where ranking cues are crucial outcomes of this process and practical guidance for saliency prediction. In this paper, we propose CaRDiff (Caption, Rank, and generate with Diffusion), a framework that imitates the process by integrating a multimodal large language model (MLLM), a grounding module, and a diffusion model, to enhance video saliency prediction. Specifically, we introduce a novel prompting method VSOR-CoT (Video Salient Object Ranking Chain of Thought), which utilizes an MLLM with a grounding module to caption video content and infer salient objects along with their rankings and positions. This process derives ranking maps that can be sufficiently leveraged by the diffusion model to decode the saliency maps for the given video accurately. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of VSOR-CoT in improving the performance of video saliency prediction. The proposed CaRDiff performs better than state-of-the-art models on the MVS dataset and demonstrates cross-dataset capabilities on the DHF1k dataset through zero-shot evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

The algorithm operates in discrete bit space, where the noising process is a continuous-time Markov chain that flips labels uniformly at random. The time-reversal process, like the forward noise process, is a jump process with its intensity governed by a discrete analogue of the classical score function. Crucially, this intensity is proven to be the conditional expectation of a function of the forward process, underlining theoretical alignment with score-based generative models. We establish convergence bounds for the algorithm under minimal assumptions, ensuring robustness and efficiency, which we demonstrate through experiments on low-dimensional Bernoulli-distributed datasets and high-dimensional binary MNIST data. The results highlight competitive performance in generating discrete structures compared to the state-of-the-art. This work bridges theoretical foundations and practical applications, advancing the development of effective and theoretically grounded discrete generative modeling.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces an efficient framework based on approximate Gaussian mapping governed by a scale factor calibrated through capacity-aware adaptive optimization. Using this framework as a unified analytical tool, systematic comparative analysis of steganography in pixel-space models versus VAE-based latent-space systems is conducted. The investigation reveals a pronounced architecture dependent security-robustness trade-off: pixel-space models achieve high security against steganalysis but exhibit fragility to channel distortions, while VAE-based systems like Stable Diffusion offer substantial robustness at the cost of security vulnerabilities. Further analysis indicates that the VAE component drives this behavior through opposing mechanisms where the encoder confers robustness via manifold regularization while the decoder introduces vulnerabilities by amplifying latent perturbations into detectable artifacts. These findings characterize the conflicting architectural roles in generative steganography and establish a foundation for future research.</p></details> | 13 pages |

These challenges have historically impeded the efficiency and scalability of Cel-Animation production. The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), encompassing large language models, multimodal models, and diffusion models, offers innovative solutions by automating tasks such as inbetween frame generation, colorization, and storyboard creation. This survey explores how GenAI integration is revolutionizing traditional animation workflows by lowering technical barriers, broadening accessibility for a wider range of creators through tools like AniDoc, ToonCrafter, and AniSora, and enabling artists to focus more on creative expression and artistic innovation.

| **[EigenScore: OOD Detection using Covariance in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07206v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of machine learning systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex data distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress, recent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose EigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum of the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that posterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift, leading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear spectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior covariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for OOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace iteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward evaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance, with up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains robust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing diffusion-based methods often fail.</p></details> |  |
| **[MV-Performer: Taming Video Diffusion Model for Faithful and Synchronized Multi-view Performer Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07190v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in video generation, powered by large-scale datasets and diffusion techniques, have shown that video diffusion models can function as implicit 4D novel view synthesizers. Nevertheless, current methods primarily concentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while struggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on human-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for creating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel view synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 conference track</p></details> |

We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T> n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta>0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> | 48 pages, 6 figures |

We consider the rate equation on the discretized circle for a process in which pairs of particles occupying the same site simultaneously jump to the two neighboring sites; the reverse process involves pairs of particles at adjacent sites simultaneously jumping back to the site located between them. Depending on the rates, in the vanishing-mesh-size limit we obtain either the classical DLSS equation or a variant with nonlinear mobility of power type. Via EDP convergence, we identify the limiting gradient structure to be driven by entropy with respect to a generalization of diffusive transport with nonlinear mobility. Interestingly, the DLSS equation with power-type mobility shares qualitative similarities with the fast diffusion and porous medium equation, since we find traveling wave solutions with algebraic tails or compactly supported polynomials, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 2 figure.

| **[A Digital Twin Framework for Metamorphic Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems Using Generative Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07133v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of self-driving cars remains a major challenge due to the complexity and unpredictability of real-world driving environments. Traditional testing methods face significant limitations, such as the oracle problem, which makes it difficult to determine whether a system's behavior is correct, and the inability to cover the full range of scenarios an autonomous vehicle may encounter. In this paper, we introduce a digital twin-driven metamorphic testing framework that addresses these challenges by creating a virtual replica of the self-driving system and its operating environment. By combining digital twin technology with AI-based image generative models such as Stable Diffusion, our approach enables the systematic generation of realistic and diverse driving scenes. This includes variations in weather, road topology, and environmental features, all while maintaining the core semantics of the original scenario. The digital twin provides a synchronized simulation environment where changes can be tested in a controlled and repeatable manner. Within this environment, we define three metamorphic relations inspired by real-world traffic rules and vehicle behavior. We validate our framework in the Udacity self-driving simulator and demonstrate that it significantly enhances test coverage and effectiveness. Our method achieves the highest true positive rate (0.719), F1 score (0.689), and precision (0.662) compared to baseline approaches. This paper highlights the value of integrating digital twins with AI-powered scenario generation to create a scalable, automated, and high-fidelity testing solution for autonomous vehicle safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Conditioned Diffusion for Controllable Histopathology Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07129v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new standards in high-quality image synthesis. Yet, controlled generation remains challenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical images feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape or texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs operate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors, making it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To address this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding to each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer module and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning mechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this approach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream segmentation tasks. The code is available here.</p></details> |  |

Mainstream Object-Centric Learning (OCL) methods adopt Slot Attention or its variants to iteratively aggregate objects' super-pixels into a fixed set of query feature vectors, termed slots. However, their reliance on a static slot count leads to an object being represented as multiple parts when the number of objects varies. We introduce MetaSlot, a plug-and-play Slot Attention variant that adapts to variable object counts. MetaSlot (i) maintains a codebook that holds prototypes of objects in a dataset by vector-quantizing the resulting slot representations; (ii) removes duplicate slots from the traditionally aggregated slots by quantizing them with the codebook; and (iii) injects progressively weaker noise into the Slot Attention iterations to accelerate and stabilize the aggregation. MetaSlot is a general Slot Attention variant that can be seamlessly integrated into existing OCL architectures. Across multiple public datasets and tasks--including object discovery and recognition--models equipped with MetaSlot achieve significant performance gains and markedly interpretable slot representations, compared with existing Slot Attention variants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Reasoning to Learning: Unmasking Illusions using Complexity Out of Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06274v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress has pushed AI frontiers from pattern recognition tasks toward problems that require step by step, System2 style reasoning, especially with large language models. Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear, consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts; reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack: incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design, rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate computation with respect to complexity.</p></details> |  |

These models have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark, VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation. Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Same Task, Different Circuits: Disentangling Modality-Specific Mechanisms in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09047v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the \textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach for reducing it.</p></details> |  |

We propose a multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11 underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains, demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset, highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable ecological insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+1 p...</summary><p>8+1 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[OmniCount: Multi-label Object Counting with Semantic-Geometric Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05435v9)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object counting is pivotal for understanding the composition of scenes. Previously, this task was dominated by class-specific methods, which have gradually evolved into more adaptable class-agnostic strategies. However, these strategies come with their own set of limitations, such as the need for manual exemplar input and multiple passes for multiple categories, resulting in significant inefficiencies. This paper introduces a more practical approach enabling simultaneous counting of multiple object categories using an open-vocabulary framework. Our solution, OmniCount, stands out by using semantic and geometric insights (priors) from pre-trained models to count multiple categories of objects as specified by users, all without additional training. OmniCount distinguishes itself by generating precise object masks and leveraging varied interactive prompts via the Segment Anything Model for efficient counting. To evaluate OmniCount, we created the OmniCount-191 benchmark, a first-of-its-kind dataset with multi-label object counts, including points, bounding boxes, and VQA annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation in OmniCount-191, alongside other leading benchmarks, demonstrates OmniCount's exceptional performance, significantly outpacing existing solutions.

We present QL-Adapter, a framework for multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and significantly outperforms existing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAR-KnowLIP: Towards Multimodal Foundation Models for Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23927v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images. However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT), providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships. (3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11 representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision Language Models are Biased](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23941v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) memorize a vast amount of prior knowledge from the Internet that helps them on downstream tasks but also may notoriously sway their outputs towards wrong or biased answers. In this work, we test how the knowledge about popular subjects hurt the accuracy of vision language models (VLMs) on standard, objective visual tasks of counting and identification. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs are strongly biased (e.g., unable to recognize the 4th stripe has been added to a 3-stripe Adidas logo) scoring an average of 17.05% accuracy in counting (e.g., counting stripes in an Adidas-like logo) across 7 diverse domains from animals, logos, chess, board games, optical illusions, to patterned grids. Removing image backgrounds nearly doubles accuracy (21.09 percentage points), revealing that contextual visual cues trigger these biased responses. Further analysis of VLMs' reasoning patterns shows that counting accuracy initially rises with thinking tokens, reaching ~40%, before declining with excessive reasoning. Our work presents an interesting failure mode in VLMs and a human-supervised automated framework for testing VLM biases.

| **[Training-Free Layout-to-Image Generation with Marginal Attention Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10495v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, many text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-resolution images from text but struggle with precise control over spatial composition and object counting. To address these challenges, prior works developed layout-to-image (L2I) approaches that incorporate layout instructions into text-to-image models. However, existing L2I methods typically require fine-tuning of pre-trained parameters or training additional control modules for the diffusion models. In this work, we propose a training-free L2I approach, MAC (Marginal Attention Constrained Generation), which eliminates the need for additional modules or fine-tuning. Specifically, we use text-visual cross-attention feature maps to quantify inconsistencies between the layout of the generated images and the provided instructions, and then compute loss functions to optimize latent features during the diffusion reverse process. To enhance spatial controllability and mitigate semantic failures in complex layout instructions, we leverage pixel-to-pixel correlations in the self-attention feature maps to align cross-attention maps and combine three loss functions constrained by boundary attention to update latent features. Comprehensive experimental results on both L2I and non-L2I pretrained diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing training-free L2I techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of image composition on the DrawBench and HRS benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While extensive research has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object counting, these tasks cover only the most elementary layer of spatial reasoning and are largely approaching saturation in the latest reasoning models. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology. OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained subcategories. Through careful manual annotation, we construct over 8.4K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both open- and closed-source VLMs exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial reasoning. We also explore two strategies-PointGraph (explicit scene graph cues) and SpatialCoT (novel-view chain-of-thought)-to bolster spatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://qizekun.github.io/omnispatial/</p></details> |

To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door", "approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper", etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://bpiyush.github.io/lift-website/</p></details> |

This is a nontrivial extension of the TPD method [Chen et al. (2023) arXiv:2312.12355] incorporating proximal splitting techniques to address the challenges arising from the nonsmoothness of the objective function. Our key contributions include: (i) a semi-implicit-explicit iteration that combines proximal steps for the nonsmooth part with explicit gradient steps for the smooth part, and variable preconditioners constructed from the Hessian of a regularized objective to balance iteration count and per-iteration cost; (ii) a proof of existence and uniqueness of bounded solutions for the resulting generalized proximal operator, along with a convergent and bound-preserving Newton solver; and (iii) an adaptive step-size strategy to improve robustness and accelerate convergence under poor Lipschitz conditions of the energy derivative. Comprehensive numerical experiments spanning from 1D to 3D settings demonstrate that our method achieves superior computational efficiency compared to existing methods, highlighting its broad applicability through several challenging simulations.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

Using a structured, reason-then-estimate pipeline on street-view imagery, GPT-4o infers neighborhood poverty and tree canopy, which we embed in a quasi-experimental design evaluating the legacy of 1930s redlining. GPT-4o recovers the expected adverse socio-environmental legacy effects of redlining, with estimates statistically indistinguishable from authoritative sources, and it outperforms a conventional pixel-based segmentation baseline-consistent with the idea that holistic scene reasoning extracts higher-order information beyond object counts alone. These results position MLLMs as policy-grade instruments for neighborhood measurement and motivate broader validation across policy-evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |

A Benchmark and Systematic Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13939v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual counting is a fundamental yet challenging task, especially when users need to count objects of a specific type in complex scenes. While recent models, including class-agnostic counting models and large vision-language models (VLMs), show promise in counting tasks, their ability to perform fine-grained, intent-driven counting remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce PairTally, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate fine-grained visual counting. Each of the 681 high-resolution images in PairTally contains two object categories, requiring models to distinguish and count based on subtle differences in shape, size, color, or semantics. The dataset includes both inter-category (distinct categories) and intra-category (closely related subcategories) settings, making it suitable for rigorous evaluation of selective counting capabilities. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art models, including exemplar-based methods, language-prompted models, and large VLMs. Our results show that despite recent advances, current models struggle to reliably count what users intend, especially in fine-grained and visually ambiguous cases. PairTally provides a new foundation for diagnosing and improving fine-grained visual counting systems.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this by annotating new data and fully retraining the model is time-consuming and does not guarantee generalization to additional novel categories at test time. Instead, we propose an alternative paradigm: Given a category name, tune a compact concept embedding derived from the prompt using synthetic images and pseudo-labels generated by a text-to-image diffusion model. This embedding conditions a specialization module that refines raw overcounts from any frozen counter into accurate, category-specific estimates\textemdash without requiring real images or human annotations. We validate our approach on \textsc{Lookalikes}, a challenging new benchmark containing 1,037 images across 27 fine-grained subcategories, and show substantial improvements over strong baselines.

However, their performance in the Intelligent Traffic Surveillance (ITS) domain remains limited due to the absence of dedicated multimodal datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MITS (Multimodal Intelligent Traffic Surveillance), the first large-scale multimodal benchmark dataset specifically designed for ITS. MITS includes 170,400 independently collected real-world ITS images sourced from traffic surveillance cameras, annotated with eight main categories and 24 subcategories of ITS-specific objects and events under diverse environmental conditions. Additionally, through a systematic data generation pipeline, we generate high-quality image captions and 5 million instruction-following visual question-answer pairs, addressing five critical ITS tasks: object and event recognition, object counting, object localization, background analysis, and event reasoning. To demonstrate MITS's effectiveness, we fine-tune mainstream LMMs on this dataset, enabling the development of ITS-specific applications. Experimental results show that MITS significantly improves LMM performance in ITS applications, increasing LLaVA-1.5's performance from 0.494 to 0.905 (+83.2%), LLaVA-1.6's from 0.678 to 0.921 (+35.8%), Qwen2-VL's from 0.584 to 0.926 (+58.6%), and Qwen2.5-VL's from 0.732 to 0.930 (+27.0%).

| **[Visual Representation Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07979v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning. We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/VIRAL/</p></details> |

In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.

In this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone, our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes, and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can be found via the following link https://github.com/ Gepardius/Taetz_Bordelius_Continual_ImageCaptioning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[AgriGPT-VL: Agricultural Vision-Language Understanding Suite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04002v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural applications remain constrained by the scarcity of domain-tailored models, curated vision-language corpora, and rigorous evaluation. To address these challenges, we present the AgriGPT-VL Suite, a unified multimodal framework for agriculture. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce Agri-3M-VL, the largest vision-language corpus for agriculture to our knowledge, curated by a scalable multi-agent data generator; it comprises 1M image-caption pairs, 2M image-grounded VQA pairs, 50K expert-level VQA instances, and 15K GRPO reinforcement learning samples. Second, we develop AgriGPT-VL, an agriculture-specialized vision-language model trained via a progressive curriculum of textual grounding, multimodal shallow/deep alignment, and GRPO refinement. This method achieves strong multimodal reasoning while preserving text-only capability. Third, we establish AgriBench-VL-4K, a compact yet challenging evaluation suite with open-ended and image-grounded questions, paired with multi-metric evaluation and an LLM-as-a-judge framework. Experiments show that AgriGPT-VL outperforms leading general-purpose VLMs on AgriBench-VL-4K, achieving higher pairwise win rates in the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Meanwhile, it remains competitive on the text-only AgriBench-13K with no noticeable degradation of language ability. Ablation studies further confirm consistent gains from our alignment and GRPO refinement stages. We will open source all of the resources to support reproducible research and deployment in low-resource agricultural settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenFake: An Open Dataset and Platform Toward Real-World Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09495v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, pose a growing threat to information integrity, particularly in politically sensitive contexts. This challenge is amplified by the increasing realism of modern generative models, which our human perception study confirms are often indistinguishable from real images. Yet, existing deepfake detection benchmarks rely on outdated generators or narrowly scoped datasets (e.g., single-face imagery), limiting their utility for real-world detection. To address these gaps, we present OpenFake, a large politically grounded dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking against modern generative models with high realism, and designed to remain extensible through an innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform that continually integrates new hard examples. OpenFake comprises nearly four million total images: three million real images paired with descriptive captions and almost one million synthetic counterparts from state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models. Detectors trained on OpenFake achieve near-perfect in-distribution performance, strong generalization to unseen generators, and high accuracy on a curated in-the-wild social media test set, significantly outperforming models trained on existing datasets. Overall, we demonstrate that with high-quality and continually updated benchmarks, automatic deepfake detection is both feasible and effective in real-world settings.</p></details> | 26 pages, 12 figures |
| **[LaB-RAG: Label Boosted Retrieval Augmented Generation for Radiology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16523v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current paradigm of image captioning, deep learning models are trained to generate text from image embeddings of latent features. We challenge the assumption that fine-tuning of large, bespoke models is required to improve model generation accuracy. Here we propose Label Boosted Retrieval Augmented Generation (LaB-RAG), a small-model-based approach to image captioning that leverages image descriptors in the form of categorical labels to boost standard retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with pretrained large language models (LLMs). We study our method in the context of radiology report generation (RRG) over MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus. We argue that simple classification models combined with zero-shot embeddings can effectively transform X-rays into text-space as radiology-specific labels. In combination with standard RAG, we show that these derived text labels can be used with general-domain LLMs to generate radiology reports. Without ever training our generative language model or image embedding models specifically for the task, and without ever directly "showing" the LLM an X-ray, we demonstrate that LaB-RAG achieves better results across natural language and radiology language metrics compared with other retrieval-based RRG methods, while attaining competitive results compared to other fine-tuned vision-language RRG models. We further conduct extensive ablation experiments to better understand the components of LaB-RAG. Our results suggest broader compatibility and synergy with fine-tuned methods to further enhance RRG performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast constrained sampling in pre-trained diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18804v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilized backpropagation through the denoiser network, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than simple text-to-image generation, or only enforced the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations in the sampled image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast, high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We show that in denoising diffusion models, we can employ an approximation to Newton's optimization method that allows us to speed up inference and avoid the expensive backpropagation operations. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference methods while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear (inpainting, super-resolution) and non-linear (style-guided generation) constraints. An implementation is provided at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/fast-constrained-sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Patch to Caption Them All: A Unified Zero-Shot Captioning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02898v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global representations and whole-image captions. We present Patch-ioner, a unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework. Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task, highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for scalable caption generation.

| **[VaseVQA-3D: Benchmarking 3D VLMs on Ancient Greek Pottery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04479v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved significant progress in multimodal understanding tasks, demonstrating strong capabilities particularly in general tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. However, when dealing with specialized cultural heritage domains like 3D vase artifacts, existing models face severe data scarcity issues and insufficient domain knowledge limitations. Due to the lack of targeted training data, current VLMs struggle to effectively handle such culturally significant specialized tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the VaseVQA-3D dataset, which serves as the first 3D visual question answering dataset for ancient Greek pottery analysis, collecting 664 ancient Greek vase 3D models with corresponding question-answer data and establishing a complete data construction pipeline. We further develop the VaseVLM model, enhancing model performance in vase artifact analysis through domain-adaptive training. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, where we improve by 12.8% on R@1 metrics and by 6.6% on lexical similarity compared with previous state-of-the-art on the VaseVQA-3D dataset, significantly improving the recognition and understanding of 3D vase artifacts, providing new technical pathways for digital heritage preservation research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18857v4)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) embed aligned image-text pairs into a joint space but often rely on deterministic embeddings, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between images and texts. This oversimplifies real-world relationships, which are inherently many-to-many, with multiple captions describing a single image and vice versa. We introduce Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-training (ProLIP), the first probabilistic VLM pre-trained on a billion-scale image-text dataset using only probabilistic objectives, achieving a strong zero-shot capability (e.g., 74.6% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy with ViT-B/16). ProLIP efficiently estimates uncertainty by an "uncertainty token" without extra parameters. We also introduce a novel inclusion loss that enforces distributional inclusion relationships between image-text pairs and between original and masked inputs. Experiments demonstrate that, by leveraging uncertainty estimates, ProLIP benefits downstream tasks and aligns with intuitive notions of uncertainty, e.g., shorter texts being more uncertain and more general inputs including specific ones. Utilizing text uncertainties, we further improve ImageNet accuracy from 74.6% to 75.8% (under a few-shot setting), supporting the practical advantages of our probabilistic approach.

| **[No Tokens Wasted: Leveraging Long Context in Biomedical Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03978v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding vision-language models (VLMs) are typically pretrained with short text windows (<77 tokens), which forces the truncation of long-format captions. Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance. Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.</p></details> |  |

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-TEXT, a large-scale and high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To construct the SAR-TEXT dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks: image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT: SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 12.97% and 10.0% on the OSdataset_512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves significant improvements over the original CoCa models in terms of BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores. In the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that, as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

However, the documentation burden associated with these procedures place significant strain on gastroenterologists, contributing to inefficiencies in clinical workflows and physician burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a novel automated report generation model that leverages a transformer-based vision encoder and text decoder within a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, both components are pre-trained on image/text caption pairs to capture generalized vision-language features, followed by fine-tuning on images/report pairs to generate clinically meaningful findings. Our approach not only streamlines the documentation process but also holds promise for reducing physician workload and improving patient care.</p></details> |  |
| **[Team Xiaomi EV-AD VLA: Caption-Guided Retrieval System for Cross-Modal Drone Navigation -- Technical Report for IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Track 4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02728v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-modal drone navigation remains a challenging task in robotics, requiring efficient retrieval of relevant images from large-scale databases based on natural language descriptions. The RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge addresses this challenge, focusing on robust, natural language-guided cross-view image retrieval across multiple platforms (drones, satellites, and ground cameras). Current baseline methods, while effective for initial retrieval, often struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic matching between text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage retrieval refinement method: Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) that enhances the baseline coarse ranking through intelligent reranking. Our method first leverages a baseline model to obtain an initial coarse ranking of the top 20 most relevant images for each query. We then use Vision-Language-Model (VLM) to generate detailed captions for these candidate images, capturing rich semantic descriptions of their visual content. These generated captions are then used in a multimodal similarity computation framework to perform fine-grained reranking of the original text query, effectively building a semantic bridge between the visual content and natural language descriptions. Our approach significantly improves upon the baseline, achieving a consistent 5\% improvement across all key metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10). Our approach win TOP-2 in the challenge, demonstrating the practical value of our semantic refinement strategy in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuroSwift: A Lightweight Cross-Subject Framework for fMRI Visual Reconstruction of Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02266v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms. Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion: AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Authentic Discrete Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01047v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations validate the measurable gains of each component.</p></details> |  |

We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency, open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git</p></details> |  |

As a key component of the transformer model, self-attention calculates the attention values by mapping the relationships among the head elements of the source and target sequence, yet there is no explicit mechanism to refine and intensify the attention values with respect to the context of the input and target sequences. Based on this intuition, we introduce a novel refine and intensify attention mechanism that is called Zoneup Dropout Injection Attention Calculation (ZoDIAC), in which the intensities of attention values in the elements of the input source and target sequences are first refined using GELU and dropout and then intensified using a proposed zoneup process which includes the injection of a learned scalar factor. Our extensive experiments show that ZoDIAC achieves statistically significant higher scores under all image captioning metrics using various feature extractors in comparison to the conventional self-attention module in the transformer model on the MS-COCO dataset. Our proposed ZoDIAC attention modules can be used as a drop-in replacement for the attention components in all transformer models.

Interpreting such creator intent is therefore essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) and effective information governance. To this end, we introduce DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark of 12,000 image-caption pairs grounded in trustworthy reference articles, created using an intent-guided simulation framework that models both the desired influence and the execution plan of news creators. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading cases, spanning manipulations across visual and textual modalities, and supports three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) and find that they struggle with intent reasoning, often relying on shallow cues such as surface-level alignment, stylistic polish, or heuristic authenticity signals. These results highlight the limitations of current VLMs and position DeceptionDecoded as a foundation for developing intent-aware models that go beyond shallow cues in MMD.</p></details> |  |

Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality. In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a scalable framework that shifts data curation from manual effort to automated, targeted synthesis, offering a promising direction for developing more reliable and continuously improving AI systems.

Current leading LLMs exhibit strong performance on a number of the most common languages (e.g. Swahili or Yoruba), but prioritise support for the languages with the most speakers first, resulting in piecemeal ability across disparate languages. We contend that a regionally focussed approach is more efficient, and present a case study for Uganda, a country with high linguistic diversity. We describe the development of Sunflower 14B and 32B, a pair of models based on Qwen 3 with state of the art comprehension in the majority of all Ugandan languages. These models are open source and can be used to reduce language barriers in a number of important practical applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[MeXtract: Light-Weight Metadata Extraction from Scientific Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06889v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metadata plays a critical role in indexing, documenting, and analyzing scientific literature, yet extracting it accurately and efficiently remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches often rely on rule-based or task-specific models, which struggle to generalize across domains and schema variations. In this paper, we present MeXtract, a family of lightweight language models designed for metadata extraction from scientific papers. The models, ranging from 0.5B to 3B parameters, are built by fine-tuning Qwen 2.5 counterparts. In their size family, MeXtract achieves state-of-the-art performance on metadata extraction on the MOLE benchmark. To further support evaluation, we extend the MOLE benchmark to incorporate model-specific metadata, providing an out-of-domain challenging subset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning on a given schema not only yields high accuracy but also transfers effectively to unseen schemas, demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of our approach. We release all the code, datasets, and models openly for the research community.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Consensus Graphs (ConGrs), a flexible DAG-based data structure that represents shared information, as well as semantic variation in a set of sampled LM responses to the same prompt. We construct ConGrs using a light-weight lexical sequence alignment algorithm from bioinformatics, supplemented by the targeted usage of a secondary LM judge. Further, we design task-dependent decoding methods to synthesize a single, final response from our ConGr data structure. Our experiments show that synthesizing responses from ConGrs improves factual precision on two biography generation tasks by up to 31% over an average response and reduces reliance on LM judges by more than 80% compared to other methods. We also use ConGrs for three refusal-based tasks requiring abstention on unanswerable queries and find that abstention rate is increased by up to 56%. We apply our approach to the MATH and AIME reasoning tasks and find an improvement over self-verification and majority vote baselines by up to 6 points of accuracy. We show that ConGrs provide a flexible method for capturing variation in LM responses and using the epistemic signals provided by response variation to synthesize more effective responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRISM-Consult: A Panel-of-Experts Architecture for Clinician-Aligned Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01114v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal, Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment standards.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Prompting Robot Teams with Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24575v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a framework towards prompting multi-robot teams with high-level tasks using natural language expressions. Our objective is to use the reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in understanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these for multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an individual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and must continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework that possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and semantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time operation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and sequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an RNN, and align its internal states with the semantics of a given task. By training a graph neural network (GNN) control policy that is conditioned on the hidden states of the RNN and the language embeddings, our method enables robots to execute task-relevant actions in a decentralized manner. We present evaluations of this single light-weight interpretable model on various simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks that require sequential and collaborative behavior by the team -- sites.google.com/view/prompting-teams.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination reduction with CASAL: Contrastive Activation Steering For Amortized Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02324v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations. These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning (CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by 30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment in production systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[EfficienT-HDR: An Efficient Transformer-Based Framework via Multi-Exposure Fusion for HDR Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19779v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving high-quality High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging on resource-constrained edge devices is a critical challenge in computer vision, as its performance directly impacts downstream tasks such as intelligent surveillance and autonomous driving. Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts, hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and practicality across various dynamic scenarios.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |
| **[RadarSFD: Single-Frame Diffusion with Pretrained Priors for Radar Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18068v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millimeter-wave radar provides perception robust to fog, smoke, dust, and low light, making it attractive for size, weight, and power constrained robotic platforms. Current radar imaging methods, however, rely on synthetic aperture or multi-frame aggregation to improve resolution, which is impractical for small aerial, inspection, or wearable systems. We present RadarSFD, a conditional latent diffusion framework that reconstructs dense LiDAR-like point clouds from a single radar frame without motion or SAR. Our approach transfers geometric priors from a pretrained monocular depth estimator into the diffusion backbone, anchors them to radar inputs via channel-wise latent concatenation, and regularizes outputs with a dual-space objective combining latent and pixel-space losses. On the RadarHD benchmark, RadarSFD achieves 35 cm Chamfer Distance and 28 cm Modified Hausdorff Distance, improving over the single-frame RadarHD baseline (56 cm, 45 cm) and remaining competitive with multi-frame methods using 5-41 frames. Qualitative results show recovery of fine walls and narrow gaps, and experiments across new environments confirm strong generalization. Ablation studies highlight the importance of pretrained initialization, radar BEV conditioning, and the dual-space loss. Together, these results establish the first practical single-frame, no-SAR mmWave radar pipeline for dense point cloud perception in compact robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEM-T: Generative Tabular Data via Fitting Moments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17752v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data dominates data science but poses challenges for generative models, especially when the data is limited or sensitive. We present a novel approach to generating synthetic tabular data based on the principle of maximum entropy -- MaxEnt -- called GEM-T, for ``generative entropy maximization for tables.'' GEM-T directly captures nth-order interactions -- pairwise, third-order, etc. -- among columns of training data. In extensive testing, GEM-T matches or exceeds deep neural network approaches previously regarded as state-of-the-art in 23 of 34 publicly available datasets representing diverse subject domains (68\%). Notably, GEM-T involves orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable parameters, demonstrating that much of the information in real-world data resides in low-dimensional, potentially human-interpretable correlations, provided that the input data is appropriately transformed first. Furthermore, MaxEnt better handles heterogeneous data types (continuous vs. discrete vs. categorical), lack of local structure, and other features of tabular data. GEM-T represents a promising direction for light-weight high-performance generative models for structured data.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |
| **[MS-YOLO: A Multi-Scale Model for Accurate and Efficient Blood Cell Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03972v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complete blood cell detection holds significant value in clinical diagnostics. Conventional manual microscopy methods suffer from time inefficiency and diagnostic inaccuracies. Existing automated detection approaches remain constrained by high deployment costs and suboptimal accuracy. While deep learning has introduced powerful paradigms to this field, persistent challenges in detecting overlapping cells and multi-scale objects hinder practical deployment. This study proposes the multi-scale YOLO (MS-YOLO), a blood cell detection model based on the YOLOv11 framework, incorporating three key architectural innovations to enhance detection performance. Specifically, the multi-scale dilated residual module (MS-DRM) replaces the original C3K2 modules to improve multi-scale discriminability; the dynamic cross-path feature enhancement module (DCFEM) enables the fusion of hierarchical features from the backbone with aggregated features from the neck to enhance feature representations; and the light adaptive-weight downsampling module (LADS) improves feature downsampling through adaptive spatial weighting while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the CBC benchmark demonstrate that MS-YOLO achieves precise detection of overlapping cells and multi-scale objects, particularly small targets such as platelets, achieving an mAP@50 of 97.4% that outperforms existing models. Further validation on the supplementary WBCDD dataset confirms its robust generalization capability. Additionally, with a lightweight architecture and real-time inference efficiency, MS-YOLO meets clinical deployment requirements, providing reliable technical support for standardized blood pathology assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There is a disagreement among the authors regarding the content and submission of the manuscript, which needs to be resolved before it can be made public</p></details> |
| **[InstanceAssemble: Layout-Aware Image Generation via Instance Assembling Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16691v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images. Recent advancements in Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation have leveraged positional conditions and textual descriptions to facilitate precise and controllable image synthesis. Despite overall progress, current L2I methods still exhibit suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose InstanceAssemble, a novel architecture that incorporates layout conditions via instance-assembling attention, enabling position control with bounding boxes (bbox) and multimodal content control including texts and additional visual content. Our method achieves flexible adaption to existing DiT-based T2I models through light-weighted LoRA modules. Additionally, we propose a Layout-to-Image benchmark, Denselayout, a comprehensive benchmark for layout-to-image generation, containing 5k images with 90k instances in total. We further introduce Layout Grounding Score (LGS), an interpretable evaluation metric to more precisely assess the accuracy of L2I generation. Experiments demonstrate that our InstanceAssemble method achieves state-of-the-art performance under complex layout conditions, while exhibiting strong compatibility with diverse style LoRA modules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Byte by Byte: Unmasking Browser Fingerprinting at the Function Level Using V8 Bytecode Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09950v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Browser fingerprinting enables persistent cross-site user tracking via subtle techniques that often evade conventional defenses or cause website breakage when script-level blocking countermeasures are applied. Addressing these challenges requires detection methods offering both function-level precision to minimize breakage and inherent robustness against code obfuscation and URL manipulation. We introduce ByteDefender, the first system leveraging V8 engine bytecode to detect fingerprinting operations specifically at the JavaScript function level. A Transformer-based classifier, trained offline on bytecode sequences, accurately identifies functions exhibiting fingerprinting behavior. We develop and evaluate light-weight signatures derived from this model to enable low-overhead, on-device matching against function bytecode during compilation but prior to execution, which only adds a 4% (average) latency to the page load time. This mechanism facilitates targeted, real-time prevention of fingerprinting function execution, thereby preserving legitimate script functionality. Operating directly on bytecode ensures inherent resilience against common code obfuscation and URL-based evasion. Our evaluation on the top 100k websites demonstrates high detection accuracy at both function- and script-level, with substantial improvements over state-of-the-art AST-based methods, particularly in robustness against obfuscation. ByteDefender offers a practical framework for effective, precise, and robust fingerprinting mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Light-Weight Cross-Modal Enhancement Method with Benchmark Construction for UAV-based Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06011v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) faces severe performance degradation when applied to UAV imagery due to the domain gap from ground-level datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a complete UAV-oriented solution that combines both dataset construction and model innovation. First, we design a refined UAV-Label Engine, which efficiently resolves annotation redundancy, inconsistency, and ambiguity, enabling the generation of largescale UAV datasets. Based on this engine, we construct two new benchmarks: UAVDE-2M, with over 2.4M instances across 1,800+ categories, and UAVCAP-15K, providing rich image-text pairs for vision-language pretraining. Second, we introduce the Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement (CAGE) module, a lightweight dual-path fusion design that integrates cross-attention, adaptive gating, and global FiLM modulation for robust textvision alignment. By embedding CAGE into the YOLO-World-v2 framework, our method achieves significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency, notably improving zero-shot detection on VisDrone by +5.3 mAP while reducing parameters and GFLOPs, and demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization on SIMD. Extensive experiments and real-world UAV deployment confirm the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed solution for UAV-based OVD</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal Camera-Based Detection of Vulnerable Road Users](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06333v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists represent more than half of global traffic deaths, yet their detection remains challenging in poor lighting, adverse weather, and unbalanced data sets. This paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI, BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy and efficiency, while class-weighted losses enhance recall for rare VRUs. Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and RGB-to-thermal augmentation boosts recall, demonstrating the potential of multimodal detection to improve VRU safety at intersections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Light-Weight Object Recognition for Real-Time Document Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06246v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions: improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model. Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system. The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while retaining a competitive OCR quality metric.

| **[Low-Dimensional Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding via Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05748v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding (FKGE) aims to facilitate collaborative learning of entity and relation embeddings from distributed Knowledge Graphs (KGs) across multiple clients, while preserving data privacy. Training FKGE models with higher dimensions is typically favored due to their potential for achieving superior performance. However, high-dimensional embeddings present significant challenges in terms of storage resource and inference speed. Unlike traditional KG embedding methods, FKGE involves multiple client-server communication rounds, where communication efficiency is critical. Existing embedding compression methods for traditional KGs may not be directly applicable to FKGE as they often require multiple model trainings which potentially incur substantial communication costs. In this paper, we propose a light-weight component based on Knowledge Distillation (KD) which is titled FedKD and tailored specifically for FKGE methods. During client-side local training, FedKD facilitates the low-dimensional student model to mimic the score distribution of triples from the high-dimensional teacher model using KL divergence loss. Unlike traditional KD way, FedKD adaptively learns a temperature to scale the score of positive triples and separately adjusts the scores of corresponding negative triples using a predefined temperature, thereby mitigating teacher over-confidence issue. Furthermore, we dynamically adjust the weight of KD loss to optimize the training process. Extensive experiments on three datasets support the effectiveness of FedKD.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPU Acceleration of SQL Analytics on Compressed Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10092v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPUs are uniquely suited to accelerate (SQL) analytics workloads thanks to their massive compute parallelism and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) -- when datasets fit in the GPU HBM, performance is unparalleled. Unfortunately, GPU HBMs remain typically small when compared with lower-bandwidth CPU main memory. Besides brute-force scaling across many GPUs, current solutions to accelerate queries on large datasets include leveraging data partitioning and loading smaller data batches in GPU HBM, and hybrid execution with a connected device (e.g., CPUs). Unfortunately, these approaches are exposed to the limitations of lower main memory and host-to-device interconnect bandwidths, introduce additional I/O overheads, or incur higher costs. This is a substantial problem when trying to scale adoption of GPUs on larger datasets. Data compression can alleviate this bottleneck, but to avoid paying for costly decompression/decoding, an ideal solution must include computation primitives to operate directly on data in compressed form. This is the focus of our paper: a set of new methods for running queries directly on light-weight compressed data using schemes such as Run-Length Encoding (RLE), index encoding, bit-width reductions, and dictionary encoding. Our novelty includes operating on multiple RLE columns without decompression, handling heterogeneous column encodings, and leveraging PyTorch tensor operations for portability across devices. Experimental evaluations show speedups of an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art commercial CPU-only analytics systems, for real-world queries on a production dataset that would not fit into GPU memory uncompressed. This work paves the road for GPU adoption in a much broader set of use cases, and it is complementary to most other scale-out or fallback mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

However, the scenario becomes particularly challenging when data samples are insufficient, requiring on-device few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) to maintain consistent model performance. Although existing work has explored parameter-efficient FSCIL frameworks based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), their deployment is still fundamentally constrained by limited device resources. Inspired by neural mechanisms, Spiking neural networks (SNNs) process spatiotemporal information efficiently, offering lower energy consumption, greater biological plausibility, and compatibility with neuromorphic hardware than ANNs. In this work, we present an SNN-based method for On-Device FSCIL, i.e., Sparsity-Aware and Fast Adaptive SNN (SAFA-SNN). We first propose sparsity-conditioned neuronal dynamics, in which most neurons remain stable while a subset stays active, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further cope with spike non-differentiability in gradient estimation, we employ zeroth-order optimization. Moreover, during incremental learning sessions, we enhance the discriminability of new classes through subspace projection, which alleviates overfitting to novel classes. Extensive experiments conducted on two standard benchmark datasets (CIFAR100 and Mini-ImageNet) and three neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR-10-DVS, DVS128gesture, and N-Caltech101) demonstrate that SAFA-SNN outperforms baseline methods, specifically achieving at least 4.01% improvement at the last incremental session on Mini-ImageNet and 20% lower energy cost over baseline methods with practical implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Classifier Synergy: Reward-Aligned Learning via Mutual Boosting Loop for FSCIL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03608v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation, their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[EFC++: Elastic Feature Consolidation with Prototype Re-balancing for Cold Start Exemplar-free Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10439v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exemplar-free Class Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to learn from a sequence of tasks without having access to previous task data. In this paper, we consider the challenging Cold Start scenario in which insufficient data is available in the first task to learn a high-quality backbone. This is especially challenging for EFCIL since it requires high plasticity, resulting in feature drift which is difficult to compensate for in the exemplar-free setting. To address this problem, we propose an effective approach to consolidate feature representations by regularizing drift in directions highly relevant to previous tasks while employing prototypes to reduce task-recency bias. Our approach, which we call Elastic Feature Consolidation++ (EFC++) exploits a tractable second-order approximation of feature drift based on a proposed Empirical Feature Matrix (EFM). The EFM induces a pseudo-metric in feature space which we use to regularize feature drift in important directions and to update Gaussian prototypes. In addition, we introduce a post-training prototype re-balancing phase that updates classifiers to compensate for feature drift. Experimental results on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-Subset, ImageNet-1K and DomainNet demonstrate that EFC++ is better able to learn new tasks by maintaining model plasticity and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of our previous conference paper https://openreview.net/forum?id=7D9X2cFnt1</p></details> |
| **[Forget Forgetting: Continual Learning in a World of Abundant Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07274v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) has traditionally focused on minimizing exemplar memory, a constraint often misaligned with modern systems where GPU time, not storage, is the primary bottleneck. This paper challenges this paradigm by investigating a more realistic regime: one where memory is abundant enough to mitigate forgetting, but full retraining from scratch remains prohibitively expensive. In this practical "middle ground", we find that the core challenge shifts from stability to plasticity, as models become biased toward prior tasks and struggle to learn new ones. Conversely, improved stability allows simple replay baselines to outperform the state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the GPU cost. To address this newly surfaced trade-off, we propose Weight Space Consolidation, a lightweight method that combines (1) rank-based parameter resets to restore plasticity with (2) weight averaging to enhance stability. Validated on both class-incremental learning with image classifiers and continual instruction tuning with large language models, our approach outperforms strong baselines while matching the low computational cost of replay, offering a scalable alternative to expensive full-retraining. These findings challenge long-standing CL assumptions and establish a new, cost-efficient baseline for real-world CL systems where exemplar memory is no longer the limiting factor.</p></details> | 24 pages, 11 figures |
| **[StPR: Spatiotemporal Preservation and Routing for Exemplar-Free Video Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13997v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Class-Incremental Learning (VCIL) seeks to develop models that continuously learn new action categories over time without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Unlike traditional Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), VCIL introduces the added complexity of spatiotemporal structures, making it particularly challenging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while effectively capturing both frame-shared semantics and temporal dynamics. Existing approaches either rely on exemplar rehearsal, raising concerns over memory and privacy, or adapt static image-based methods that neglect temporal modeling. To address these limitations, we propose Spatiotemporal Preservation and Routing (StPR), a unified and exemplar-free VCIL framework that explicitly disentangles and preserves spatiotemporal information. First, we introduce Frame-Shared Semantics Distillation (FSSD), which identifies semantically stable and meaningful channels by jointly considering semantic sensitivity and classification contribution. These important semantic channels are selectively regularized to maintain prior knowledge while allowing for adaptation. Second, we design a Temporal Decomposition-based Mixture-of-Experts (TD-MoE), which dynamically routes task-specific experts based on their temporal dynamics, enabling inference without task ID or stored exemplars. Together, StPR effectively leverages spatial semantics and temporal dynamics, achieving a unified, exemplar-free VCIL framework. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics400 show that our method outperforms existing baselines while offering improved interpretability and efficiency in VCIL. Code is available in the supplementary materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMO-TTA: Improving Test-Time Adaptation of Audio-Language Models for Speech Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25495v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech emotion recognition (SER) with audio-language models (ALMs) remains vulnerable to distribution shifts at test time, leading to performance degradation in out-of-domain scenarios. Test-time adaptation (TTA) provides a promising solution but often relies on gradient-based updates or prompt tuning, limiting flexibility and practicality. We propose Emo-TTA, a lightweight, training-free adaptation framework that incrementally updates class-conditional statistics via an Expectation-Maximization procedure for explicit test-time distribution estimation, using ALM predictions as priors. Emo-TTA operates on individual test samples without modifying model weights. Experiments on six out-of-domain SER benchmarks show consistent accuracy improvements over prior TTA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of statistical adaptation in aligning model predictions with evolving test distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Avoid Catastrophic Forgetting with Rank-1 Fisher from Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23593v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation (EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1 variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular, forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks, while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.</p></details> | 18 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Toward a Holistic Approach to Continual Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23592v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular, conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information. Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Workshop on Continual Learning in Computer Vision, ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[DDP: Dual-Decoupled Prompting for Multi-Label Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23335v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10 benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Synthetic Replays: Turning Diffusion Features into Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23402v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely limited training data while requiring models to acquire new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. Recent works have explored generative models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), to address these challenges. However, existing approaches use SD mainly as a replay generator, whereas we demonstrate that SD's rich multi-scale representations can serve as a unified backbone. Motivated by this observation, we introduce Diffusion-FSCIL, which extracts four synergistic feature types from SD by capturing real image characteristics through inversion, providing semantic diversity via class-conditioned synthesis, enhancing generalization through controlled noise injection, and enabling replay without image storage through generative features. Unlike conventional approaches requiring synthetic buffers and separate classification backbones, our unified framework operates entirely in the latent space with only lightweight networks ($\approx$6M parameters). Extensive experiments on CUB-200, miniImageNet, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with comprehensive ablations confirming the necessity of each feature type. Furthermore, we confirm that our streamlined variant maintains competitive accuracy while substantially improving efficiency, establishing the viability of generative models as practical and effective backbones for FSCIL.</p></details> | pre-print ver 2 |
| **[Hierarchical Representation Matching for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22645v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as "a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details. Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Lie of the Average: How Class Incremental Learning Evaluation Deceives You?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22580v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking.

| **[Activation Function Design Sustains Plasticity in Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22562v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings: (i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closing the Oracle Gap: Increment Vector Transformation for Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21898v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC), we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding, we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths, IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[DATS: Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling for Calibrated Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21161v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective, relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS), which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Buffer-free Class-Incremental Learning with Out-of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23412v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) poses significant challenges in open-world scenarios, where models must not only learn new classes over time without forgetting previous ones but also handle inputs from unknown classes that a closed-set model would misclassify. Recent works address both issues by (i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework, and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets support our findings, offering new insights into the design of efficient and privacy-preserving CIL systems for open-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixture of Noise for Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16738v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continuously learn new categories while retaining the knowledge of old ones. Pre-trained models (PTMs) show promising capabilities in CIL. However, existing approaches that apply lightweight fine-tuning to backbones still induce parameter drift, thereby compromising the generalization capability of pre-trained models. Parameter drift can be conceptualized as a form of noise that obscures critical patterns learned for previous tasks. However, recent researches have shown that noise is not always harmful. For example, the large number of visual patterns learned from pre-training can be easily abused by a single task, and introducing appropriate noise can suppress some low-correlation features, thus leaving a margin for future tasks. To this end, we propose learning beneficial noise for CIL guided by information theory and propose Mixture of Noise (Min), aiming to mitigate the degradation of backbone generalization from adapting new tasks. Specifically, task-specific noise is learned from high-dimension features of new tasks. Then, a set of weights is adjusted dynamically for optimal mixture of different task noise. Finally, Min embeds the beneficial noise into the intermediate features to mask the response of inefficient patterns. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that Min achieves state-of-the-art performance in most incremental settings, with particularly outstanding results in 50-steps incremental settings. This shows the significant potential for beneficial noise in continual learning.

| **[MoTiC: Momentum Tightness and Contrast for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19664v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) must contend with the dual challenge of learning new classes from scarce samples while preserving old class knowledge. Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and class-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and overfitting. However, new-class prototypes suffer significant estimation bias due to extreme data scarcity, whereas base-class prototypes benefit from sufficient data. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that aligning the new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis reduces variance and improves prototype accuracy. Furthermore, we propose large-scale contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. To further enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes, we integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the Momentum Tightness and Contrast framework (MoTiC), constructing a feature space with rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion. Experiments on three FSCIL benchmarks produce state-of-the-art performances, particularly on the fine-grained task CUB-200, validating our method's ability to reduce estimation bias and improve incremental learning robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class-wise Balancing Data Replay for Federated Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07712v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS'25 Accepted, Oral</p></details> |
| **[Hyperbolic Coarse-to-Fine Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18504v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of machine learning, hyperbolic space demonstrates superior representation capabilities for hierarchical data compared to conventional Euclidean space. This work focuses on the Coarse-To-Fine Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) task. Our study follows the Knowe approach, which contrastively learns coarse class labels and subsequently normalizes and freezes the classifier weights of learned fine classes in the embedding space. To better interpret the "coarse-to-fine" paradigm, we propose embedding the feature extractor into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ the Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space, enabling the feature extractor to transform input images into feature vectors within the Poincar\'e ball instead of Euclidean space. We further introduce hyperbolic contrastive loss and hyperbolic fully-connected layers to facilitate model optimization and classification in hyperbolic space. Additionally, to enhance performance under few-shot conditions, we implement maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic space to estimate the probability distribution of fine-class feature vectors. This allows generation of augmented features from the distribution to mitigate overfitting during training with limited samples. Experiments on C2FSCIL benchmarks show that our method effectively improves both coarse and fine class accuracies.</p></details> |  |
