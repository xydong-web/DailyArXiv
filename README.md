| **[PixCell: A generative foundation model for digital histopathology images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05127v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks, such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M, a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation, improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Piloting Structure-Based Drug Design via Modality-Specific Optimal Schedule](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07286v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is crucial for identifying bioactive molecules. Recent deep generative models are faced with challenges in geometric structure modeling. A major bottleneck lies in the twisted probability path of multi-modalities -- continuous 3D positions and discrete 2D topologies -- which jointly determine molecular geometries. By establishing the fact that noise schedules decide the Variational Lower Bound (VLB) for the twisted probability path, we propose VLB-Optimal Scheduling (VOS) strategy in this under-explored area, which optimizes VLB as a path integral for SBDD. Our model effectively enhances molecular geometries and interaction modeling, achieving state-of-the-art PoseBusters passing rate of 95.9% on CrossDock, more than 10% improvement upon strong baselines, while maintaining high affinities and robust intramolecular validity evaluated on held-out test set.

| **[UniSim: A Unified Simulator for Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Biomolecules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03157v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for understanding the atomic-level behavior of molecular systems, giving insights into their transitions and interactions. However, classical MD techniques are limited by the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, while recent deep learning-based improvements have mostly focused on single-domain molecules, lacking transferability to unfamiliar molecular systems. Therefore, we propose \textbf{Uni}fied \textbf{Sim}ulator (UniSim), which leverages cross-domain knowledge to enhance the understanding of atomic interactions. First, we employ a multi-head pretraining approach to learn a unified atomic representation model from a large and diverse set of molecular data. Then, based on the stochastic interpolant framework, we learn the state transition patterns over long timesteps from MD trajectories, and introduce a force guidance module for rapidly adapting to different chemical environments. Our experiments demonstrate that UniSim achieves highly competitive performance across small molecules, peptides, and proteins.</p></details> | ICML 2025 poster |

| **[FragFM: Hierarchical Framework for Efficient Molecule Generation via Fragment-Level Discrete Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15805v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce FragFM, a novel hierarchical framework via fragment-level discrete flow matching for efficient molecular graph generation. FragFM generates molecules at the fragment level, leveraging a coarse-to-fine autoencoder to reconstruct details at the atom level. Together with a stochastic fragment bag strategy to effectively handle an extensive fragment space, our framework enables more efficient and scalable molecular generation. We demonstrate that our fragment-based approach achieves better property control than the atom-based method and additional flexibility through conditioning the fragment bag. We also propose a Natural Product Generation benchmark (NPGen) to evaluate modern molecular graph generative models' ability to generate natural product-like molecules. Since natural products are biologically prevalidated and differ from typical drug-like molecules, our benchmark provides a more challenging yet meaningful evaluation relevant to drug discovery. We conduct a FragFM comparative study against various models on diverse molecular generation benchmarks, including NPGen, demonstrating superior performance. The results highlight the potential of fragment-based generative modeling for large-scale, property-aware molecular design, paving the way for more efficient exploration of chemical space.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 24 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Search for Inference-Time Alignment in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02039v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown promising generative capabilities across diverse domains, yet aligning their outputs with desired reward functions remains a challenge, particularly in cases where reward functions are non-differentiable. Some gradient-free guidance methods have been developed, but they often struggle to achieve optimal inference-time alignment. In this work, we newly frame inference-time alignment in diffusion as a search problem and propose Dynamic Search for Diffusion (DSearch), which subsamples from denoising processes and approximates intermediate node rewards. It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Large Language Models for Polymer Property Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02129v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has revolutionized polymer science by enabling rapid property prediction and generative design. Large language models (LLMs) offer further opportunities in polymer informatics by simplifying workflows that traditionally rely on large labeled datasets, handcrafted representations, and complex feature engineering. LLMs leverage natural language inputs through transfer learning, eliminating the need for explicit fingerprinting and streamlining training. In this study, we finetune general purpose LLMs -- open-source LLaMA-3-8B and commercial GPT-3.5 -- on a curated dataset of 11,740 entries to predict key thermal properties: glass transition, melting, and decomposition temperatures. Using parameter-efficient fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization, we benchmark these models against traditional fingerprinting-based approaches -- Polymer Genome, polyGNN, and polyBERT -- under single-task (ST) and multi-task (MT) learning. We find that while LLM-based methods approach traditional models in performance, they generally underperform in predictive accuracy and efficiency. LLaMA-3 consistently outperforms GPT-3.5, likely due to its tunable open-source architecture. Additionally, ST learning proves more effective than MT, as LLMs struggle to capture cross-property correlations, a key strength of traditional methods. Analysis of molecular embeddings reveals limitations of general purpose LLMs in representing nuanced chemo-structural information compared to handcrafted features and domain-specific embeddings. These findings provide insight into the interplay between molecular embeddings and natural language processing, guiding LLM selection for polymer informatics.</p></details> | 5 figures |
| **[Disentangling Total-Variance and Signal-to-Noise-Ratio Improves Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08598v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long sampling time of diffusion models remains a significant bottleneck, which can be mitigated by reducing the number of diffusion time steps. However, the quality of samples with fewer steps is highly dependent on the noise schedule, i.e., the specific manner in which noise is introduced and the signal is reduced at each step. Although prior work has improved upon the original variance-preserving and variance-exploding schedules, these approaches $\textit{passively}$ adjust the total variance, without direct control over it. In this work, we propose a novel total-variance/signal-to-noise-ratio disentangled (TV/SNR) framework, where TV and SNR can be controlled independently. Our approach reveals that schedules where the TV explodes exponentially can often be improved by adopting a constant TV schedule while preserving the same SNR schedule. Furthermore, generalizing the SNR schedule of the optimal transport flow matching significantly improves the generation performance. Our findings hold across various reverse diffusion solvers and diverse applications, including molecular structure and image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recent Developments in GNNs for Drug Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01302v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we review recent developments and the role of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in computational drug discovery, including molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and drug-drug interaction prediction. By summarizing the most recent developments in this area, we underscore the capabilities of GNNs to comprehend intricate molecular patterns, while exploring both their current and prospective applications. We initiate our discussion by examining various molecular representations, followed by detailed discussions and categorization of existing GNN models based on their input types and downstream application tasks. We also collect a list of commonly used benchmark datasets for a variety of applications. We conclude the paper with brief discussions and summarize common trends in this important research area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Generative Diffusion Models for Physically Grounded, Robust, and Safe Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01121v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable generative capabilities of diffusion models, their integration into safety-critical or scientifically rigorous applications remains hindered by the need to ensure compliance with stringent physical, structural, and operational constraints. To address this challenge, this paper introduces Neuro-Symbolic Diffusion (NSD), a novel framework that interleaves diffusion steps with symbolic optimization, enabling the generation of certifiably consistent samples under user-defined functional and logic constraints. This key feature is provided for both standard and discrete diffusion models, enabling, for the first time, the generation of both continuous (e.g., images and trajectories) and discrete (e.g., molecular structures and natural language) outputs that comply with constraints. This ability is demonstrated on tasks spanning three key challenges: (1) Safety, in the context of non-toxic molecular generation and collision-free trajectory optimization; (2) Data scarcity, in domains such as drug discovery and materials engineering; and (3) Out-of-domain generalization, where enforcing symbolic constraints allows adaptation beyond the training distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 2nd International Conference on Neuro-symbolic Systems (NeuS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[On scalable and efficient training of diffusion samplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19552v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of training diffusion models to sample from unnormalized energy distributions in the absence of data, the so-called diffusion samplers. Although these approaches have shown promise, they struggle to scale in more demanding scenarios where energy evaluations are expensive and the sampling space is high-dimensional. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable and sample-efficient framework that properly harmonizes the powerful classical sampling method and the diffusion sampler. Specifically, we utilize Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) samplers with a novelty-based auxiliary energy as a Searcher to collect off-policy samples, using an auxiliary energy function to compensate for exploring modes the diffusion sampler rarely visits. These off-policy samples are then combined with on-policy data to train the diffusion sampler, thereby expanding its coverage of the energy landscape. Furthermore, we identify primacy bias, i.e., the preference of samplers for early experience during training, as the main cause of mode collapse during training, and introduce a periodic re-initialization trick to resolve this issue. Our method significantly improves sample efficiency on standard benchmarks for diffusion samplers and also excels at higher-dimensional problems and real-world molecular conformer generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models for Increasing Accuracy in Olfaction Sensors and Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00455v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines with vision-language models (VLMs) This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and the training data of VLMs, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors which emulate human olfactory recognition through electronic sensor arrays. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making in environments where olfactory cues are essential. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of robotic olfaction, offering a scalable solution to the challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Molecular Grammar: Multi-Modal Foundation Models Induce Interpretable Molecular Graph Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22948v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent data-efficient molecular generation approaches exploit graph grammars to introduce interpretability into the generative models. However, grammar learning therein relies on expert annotation or unreliable heuristics for algorithmic inference. We propose Foundation Molecular Grammar (FMG), which leverages multi-modal foundation models (MMFMs) to induce an interpretable molecular language. By exploiting the chemical knowledge of an MMFM, FMG renders molecules as images, describes them as text, and aligns information across modalities using prompt learning. FMG can be used as a drop-in replacement for the prior grammar learning approaches in molecular generation and property prediction. We show that FMG not only excels in synthesizability, diversity, and data efficiency but also offers built-in chemical interpretability for automated molecular discovery workflows.

| **[Adjoint Sampling: Highly Scalable Diffusion Samplers via Adjoint Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11713v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Adjoint Sampling, a highly scalable and efficient algorithm for learning diffusion processes that sample from unnormalized densities, or energy functions. It is the first on-policy approach that allows significantly more gradient updates than the number of energy evaluations and model samples, allowing us to scale to much larger problem settings than previously explored by similar methods. Our framework is theoretically grounded in stochastic optimal control and shares the same theoretical guarantees as Adjoint Matching, being able to train without the need for corrective measures that push samples towards the target distribution. We show how to incorporate key symmetries, as well as periodic boundary conditions, for modeling molecules in both cartesian and torsional coordinates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on classical energy functions, and further scale up to neural network-based energy models where we perform amortized conformer generation across many molecular systems. To encourage further research in developing highly scalable sampling methods, we plan to open source these challenging benchmarks, where successful methods can directly impact progress in computational chemistry.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffMS: Diffusion Generation of Molecules Conditioned on Mass Spectra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09571v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mass spectrometry plays a fundamental role in elucidating the structures of unknown molecules and subsequent scientific discoveries. One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional de novo generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on de novo molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size. DiffMS code is publicly available at https://github.com/coleygroup/DiffMS.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

| **[Mitigating Degree Bias Adaptively with Hard-to-Learn Nodes in Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05214v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information. This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against baselines at both global and degree levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Visual Fusion Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Person Human-Object Interaction Recognition in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03440v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition in videos requires understanding both visual patterns and geometric relationships as they evolve over time. Visual and geometric features offer complementary strengths. Visual features capture appearance context, while geometric features provide structural patterns. Effectively fusing these multimodal features without compromising their unique characteristics remains challenging. We observe that establishing robust, entity-specific representations before modeling interactions helps preserve the strengths of each modality. Therefore, we hypothesize that a bottom-up approach is crucial for effective multimodal fusion. Following this insight, we propose the Geometric Visual Fusion Graph Neural Network (GeoVis-GNN), which uses dual-attention feature fusion combined with interdependent entity graph learning. It progressively builds from entity-specific representations toward high-level interaction understanding. To advance HOI recognition to real-world scenarios, we introduce the Concurrent Partial Interaction Dataset (MPHOI-120). It captures dynamic multi-person interactions involving concurrent actions and partial engagement. This dataset helps address challenges like complex human-object dynamics and mutual occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various HOI scenarios. These scenarios include two-person interactions, single-person activities, bimanual manipulations, and complex concurrent partial interactions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA)</p></details> |
| **[Influence Functions for Edge Edits in Non-Convex Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04694v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However, existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions, exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures. Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Oversmoothing Fallacy: A Misguided Narrative in GNN Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04653v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ignoring Directionality Leads to Compromised Graph Neural Network Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04608v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical domains, where reliable explanations are vital for supporting human decision-making. However, the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information, leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our analysis demonstrates how this practice compromises explanation fidelity. Through theoretical and empirical studies, we show that preserving directional semantics significantly improves explanation quality, ensuring more faithful insights for human decision-makers. These findings highlight the need for direction-aware GNN explainability in security-critical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligent4DSE: Optimizing High-Level Synthesis Design Space Exploration with Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19649v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level synthesis (HLS) design space exploration (DSE) is an optimization process in electronic design automation (EDA) that systematically explores high-level design configurations to achieve Pareto-optimal hardware implementations balancing performance, area, and power (PPA). To optimize this process, HLS prediction tasks often employ message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), leveraging complex architectures to achieve high accuracy. These predictors serve as evaluators in the DSE process, effectively bypassing the time-consuming estimations traditionally required by HLS tools. However, existing models often prioritize structural complexity and minimization of training loss, overlooking task-specific characteristics. Additionally, while evolutionary algorithms are widely used in DSE, they typically require extensive domain-specific knowledge to design effective crossover and mutation operators. To address these limitations, we propose CoGNNs-LLMEA, a framework that integrates a graph neural network with task-adaptive message passing and a large language model-enhanced evolutionary algorithm. As a predictive model, CoGNNs directly leverages intermediate representations generated from source code after compiler front-end processing, enabling prediction of quality of results (QoR) without invoking HLS tools. Due to its strong adaptability to tasks, CoGNNs can be tuned to predict post-HLS and post-implementation outcomes, effectively bridging the gap between high-level abstractions and physical implementation characteristics. CoGNNs achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in post-HLS QoR prediction, reducing mean prediction errors by 2.8$\times$ for latency and 3.4$\times$ for resource utilization compared to baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00401v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can integrating spectral and curvature signals unlock new potential in graph representation learning? Non-Euclidean geometries, particularly Riemannian manifolds such as hyperbolic (negative curvature) and spherical (positive curvature), offer powerful inductive biases for embedding complex graph structures like scale-free, hierarchical, and cyclic patterns. Meanwhile, spectral filtering excels at processing signal variations across graphs, making it effective in homophilic and heterophilic settings. Leveraging both can significantly enhance the learned representations. To this end, we propose Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (CUSP) - the first graph representation learning paradigm that unifies both CUrvature (geometric) and SPectral insights. CUSP is a mixed-curvature spectral GNN that learns spectral filters to optimize node embeddings in products of constant-curvature manifolds (hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean). Specifically, CUSP introduces three novel components: (a) Cusp Laplacian, an extension of the traditional graph Laplacian based on Ollivier-Ricci curvature, designed to capture the curvature signals better; (b) Cusp Filtering, which employs multiple Riemannian graph filters to obtain cues from various bands in the eigenspectrum; and (c) Cusp Pooling, a hierarchical attention mechanism combined with a curvature-based positional encoding to assess the relative importance of differently curved substructures in our graph. Empirical evaluation across eight homophilic and heterophilic datasets demonstrates the superiority of CUSP in node classification and link prediction tasks, with a gain of up to 5.3% over state-of-the-art models. The code is available at: https://github.com/amazon-science/cusp.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we identify the expressivity of sparse subnetworks, i.e. their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs, as crucial for finding winning tickets that preserve the predictive performance. We establish conditions under which the expressivity of a sparsely initialized GNN matches that of the full network, particularly when compared to the Weisfeiler-Leman test, and in that context put forward and prove a Strong Expressive Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. We subsequently show that an increased expressivity in the initialization potentially accelerates model convergence and improves generalization. Our findings establish novel theoretical foundations for both LTH and GNN research, highlighting the importance of maintaining expressivity in sparsely initialized GNNs. We illustrate our results using examples from drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, event data frequently suffers from considerable noise, negatively impacting the performance and robustness of deep learning models. Traditionally, this problem has been addressed by applying filtering algorithms to the event stream, but this may also remove some of relevant data. In this paper, we propose a novel noise-injection training methodology designed to enhance the neural networks robustness against varying levels of event noise. Our approach introduces controlled noise directly into the training data, enabling models to learn noise-resilient representations. We have conducted extensive evaluations of the proposed method using multiple benchmark datasets (N-Caltech101, N-Cars, and Mini N-ImageNet) and various network architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Vision Transformers, Spiking Neural Networks, and Graph Convolutional Networks. Experimental results show that our noise-injection training strategy achieves stable performance over a range of noise intensities, consistently outperforms event-filtering techniques, and achieves the highest average classification accuracy, making it a viable alternative to traditional event-data filtering methods in an object classification system.

Efficient joint channel and power allocation (JCPA) is crucial for managing interference. In this paper, we first propose an enhanced WMMSE (eWMMSE) algorithm to solve the JCPA problem in multi-channel wireless networks. To reduce the computational complexity of iterative optimization, we further introduce JCPGNN-M, a graph neural network-based solution that enables simultaneous multi-channel allocation for each user. We reformulate the problem as a Lagrangian function, which allows us to enforce the total power constraints systematically. Our solution involves combining this Lagrangian framework with GNNs and iteratively updating the Lagrange multipliers and resource allocation scheme. Unlike existing GNN-based methods that limit each user to a single channel, JCPGNN-M supports efficient spectrum reuse and scales well in dense network scenarios. Simulation results show that JCPGNN-M achieves better data rate compared to eWMMSE. Meanwhile, the inference time of JCPGNN-M is much lower than eWMMS, and it can generalize well to larger networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneForecast: A Universal Framework for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00338v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention, agricultural planning, etc. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are computationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical data. In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework (OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that OneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.

| **[SF$^2$Bench: Evaluating Data-Driven Models for Compound Flood Forecasting in South Florida](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04281v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors. Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide, rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.</p></details> | 60 Pages |

We propose two diagonalization algorithms based on hard and soft constraints on adjacency matrix and two loss functions using diagonal constraint and complementary constraint. The DaigNet eliminates the need for designing a set of anchor boxes commonly used. To prove feasibility of our novel detector, we adopt detection head in YOLO models. Experiments show that the DiagNet achieves 7.5% higher mAP50 on Pascal VOC than YOLOv1. The DiagNet also shows 5.1% higher mAP on MS COCO than YOLOv3u, 3.7% higher mAP than YOLOv5u, and 2.9% higher mAP than YOLOv8.</p></details> |  |

Our work builds upon state-of-the-art advances in the area of human pose estimation, graph-attention neural networks, and transformer interpretablity. The downstream task is to assist rehabilitation by providing informative feedback to users while they are performing prescribed exercises. We utilize a contrastive learning strategy during training. Given a tuple of correctly and incorrectly executed exercises, our model is able to identify and highlight those joints that are involved in an incorrect movement and thus require the user's attention. We collected an in-house dataset, ExeCheck, with paired recordings of both correct and incorrect execution of exercises. In our experiments, we tested our method on this dataset as well as the UI-PRMD dataset and found ExeCheck outperformed the baseline method using pairwise sequence alignment in identifying joints of physical relevance in rehabilitation exercises.</p></details> |  |

Although conventional learning-based models have been developed to overcome these challenges, they are negatively impacted by topology changes and real-time data loss. This paper proposes a novel deep geometric learning approach based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate the states of PMU-unobservable power systems. The proposed approach combines graph convolution and multi-head graph attention layers inside a customized end-to-end learning framework to handle topology changes and real-time data loss. An upper bound on SE error as a function of topology change is also derived. Experimental results for different test systems demonstrate superiority of the proposed customized GNN-SE (CGNN-SE) over traditional optimization-based techniques as well as conventional learning-based models in presence of topology changes, PMU failures, bad data, non-Gaussian measurement noise, and large system implementation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Contrastive Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05350v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g., class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows, enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs. We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x, (2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9 compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code at: https://github.com/gstoica27/DeltaFM.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Diffusion Transformer Designs via Grafting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05340v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators (e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width). However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants. Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model (PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77) than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging from operator replacement to architecture restructuring.

We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized} energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective, ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64 dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a low-dimensional manifold.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeedVR2: One-Step Video Restoration via Diffusion Adversarial Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05301v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration, extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored, particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2, which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically, an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses, including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a single step.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft Ver.

This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e. learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2) a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions required to combine these and other components for stable and sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data. Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by 5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .</p></details> |  |

However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore, by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35, surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling speed.

| **[Stable Vision Concept Transformers for Medical Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05286v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer (VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field. To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus meeting the needs of the medical field.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2304.06129 by other authors</p></details> |

Diffusion-Driven Approach with Multi-Grained Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05276v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing (TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence - consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs, offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Moment Identification for Nonlinear PDEs via a Neural ODE Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05245v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories, enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series. Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed, facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system. Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.</p></details> |  |

In a recent computer use demo, a language model switched from coding to Googling pictures of Yellowstone, and these sudden shifts in behavior have also been observed in reasoning patterns and jailbreaks. This phenomenon is not unique to autoregressive models: in diffusion models, key features of the final output are decided in narrow ``critical windows'' of the generation process. In this work we develop a simple, unifying theory to explain this phenomenon using the formalism of stochastic localization samplers. We show that it emerges generically as the generation process localizes to a sub-population of the distribution it models. While critical windows have been studied at length in diffusion models, existing theory heavily relies on strong distributional assumptions and the particulars of Gaussian diffusion. In contrast to existing work our theory (1) applies to autoregressive and diffusion models; (2) makes no distributional assumptions; (3) quantitatively improves previous bounds even when specialized to diffusions; and (4) requires basic tools and no stochastic calculus or statistical-physics-based machinery. We also identify an intriguing connection to the all-or-nothing phenomenon from statistical inference. Finally, we validate our predictions empirically for LLMs and find that critical windows often coincide with failures in problem solving for various math and reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05231v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach, Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations. On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost -- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency, outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ICML 2025</p></details> |

As for the motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the 3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion.

Existing per-scene optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.</p></details> |  |

Supervised methods often fail, as training data rarely covers all count variations. Methods that manipulate the denoising process to add or remove objects can help; however, they still require labeled data, limit robustness and image quality, and rely on a slow, iterative process. Pre-trained differentiable counting models that rely on soft object density summation exist and could steer generation, but employing them presents three main challenges: (i) they are pre-trained on clean images, making them less effective during denoising steps that operate on noisy inputs; (ii) they are not robust to viewpoint changes; and (iii) optimization is computationally expensive, requiring repeated model evaluations per image. We propose a new framework that uses pre-trained object counting techniques and object detectors to guide generation. First, we optimize a counting token using an outer-loop loss computed on fully generated images. Second, we introduce a detection-driven scaling term that corrects errors caused by viewpoint and proportion shifts, among other factors, without requiring backpropagation through the detection model. Third, we show that the optimized parameters can be reused for new prompts, removing the need for repeated optimization. Our method provides efficiency through token reuse, flexibility via compatibility with various detectors, and accuracy with improved counting across diverse object categories.</p></details> | Pre-print |

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

While extensive research has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object counting, these tasks represent only the most fundamental level of spatial reasoning. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology. OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained subcategories. Through Internet data crawling and careful manual annotation, we construct over 1.5K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both open- and closed-source VLMs, as well as existing reasoning and spatial understanding models, exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial understanding.

However, current image editing largely overlooks multi-object scenarios, where precise control over object categories, counts, and spatial layouts remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce a new task, quantity-and-layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit), which aims to enable fine-grained control of object quantity and spatial structure in complex scenes. We further propose IMAGHarmony, a structure-aware framework that incorporates harmony-aware attention (HA) to integrate multimodal semantics, explicitly modeling object counts and layouts to enhance editing accuracy and structural consistency. In addition, we observe that diffusion models are susceptible to initial noise and exhibit strong preferences for specific noise patterns. Motivated by this, we present a preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that chooses semantically aligned initial noise samples based on vision-language matching, thereby improving generation stability and layout consistency in multi-object editing. To support evaluation, we construct HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGHarmony consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural alignment and semantic accuracy.

| **[ComposeAnything: Composite Object Priors for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24086v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating images from text involving complex and novel object arrangements remains a significant challenge for current text-to-image (T2I) models. Although prior layout-based methods improve object arrangements using spatial constraints with 2D layouts, they often struggle to capture 3D positioning and sacrifice quality and coherence. In this work, we introduce ComposeAnything, a novel framework for improving compositional image generation without retraining existing T2I models. Our approach first leverages the chain-of-thought reasoning abilities of LLMs to produce 2.5D semantic layouts from text, consisting of 2D object bounding boxes enriched with depth information and detailed captions. Based on this layout, we generate a spatial and depth aware coarse composite of objects that captures the intended composition, serving as a strong and interpretable prior that replaces stochastic noise initialization in diffusion-based T2I models. This prior guides the denoising process through object prior reinforcement and spatial-controlled denoising, enabling seamless generation of compositional objects and coherent backgrounds, while allowing refinement of inaccurate priors. ComposeAnything outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the T2I-CompBench and NSR-1K benchmarks for prompts with 2D/3D spatial arrangements, high object counts, and surreal compositions. Human evaluations further demonstrate that our model generates high-quality images with compositions that faithfully reflect the text.</p></details> |  |

Despite their advanced visual perception, large vision-language models (LVLMs) are known to struggle with counting tasks. In this work, we evaluate the performance of several recent LVLMs on visual counting tasks across multiple counting and vision datasets. We observe that while their performance may be less prone to error for small numbers of objects, they exhibit significant weaknesses as the number of objects increases. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple yet effective baseline method that enhances LVLMs' counting ability for large numbers of objects using a divide-and-conquer approach. Our method decomposes counting problems into sub-tasks. Moreover, it incorporates a mechanism to prevent objects from being split during division, which could otherwise lead to repetitive counting -- a common issue in a naive divide-and-conquer implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various datasets and benchmarks, establishing it as a valuable reference for evaluating future solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 24 Figures, 19 Tables</p></details> |

In this work, we test how the knowledge about popular subjects hurt the accuracy of vision language models (VLMs) on standard, objective visual tasks of counting and identification. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs are strongly biased (e.g, unable to recognize a fourth stripe has been added to a 3-stripe Adidas logo) scoring an average of 17.05% accuracy in counting (e.g., counting stripes in an Adidas-like logo) across 7 diverse domains from animals, logos, chess, board games, optical illusions, to patterned grids. Insert text (e.g., "Adidas") describing the subject name into the counterfactual image further decreases VLM accuracy. The biases in VLMs are so strong that instructing them to double-check their results or rely exclusively on image details to answer improves counting accuracy by only +2 points, on average. Our work presents an interesting failure mode in VLMs and an automated framework for testing VLM biases.

On the other hand, a running time of $n^{o(t / \log t)}$ would refute the exponential-time hypothesis. Komarath, Pandey and Rahul (Algorithmica, 2023) studied algebraic variants of these counting problems, i.e., homomorphism and subgraph $\textit{polynomials}$ for fixed graphs $H$. These polynomials are weighted sums over the objects counted above, where each object is weighted by the product of variables corresponding to edges contained in the object. As shown by Komarath et al., the $\textit{monotone}$ circuit complexity of the homomorphism polynomial for $H$ is $\Theta(n^{\mathrm{tw}(H)+1})$. In this paper, we characterize the power of monotone $\textit{bounded-depth}$ circuits for homomorphism and colorful subgraph polynomials. This leads us to discover a natural hierarchy of graph parameters $\mathrm{tw}_\Delta(H)$, for fixed $\Delta \in \mathbb N$, which capture the width of tree-decompositions for $H$ when the underlying tree is required to have depth at most $\Delta$. We prove that monotone circuits of product-depth $\Delta$ computing the homomorphism polynomial for $H$ require size $\Theta(n^{\mathrm{tw}_\Delta(H^{\dagger})+1})$, where $H^{\dagger}$ is the graph obtained from $H$ by removing all degree-$1$ vertices. This allows us to derive an optimal depth hierarchy theorem for monotone bounded-depth circuits through graph-theoretic arguments.</p></details> | 22 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Improving Contrastive Learning for Referring Expression Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22850v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object counting has progressed from class-specific models, which count only known categories, to class-agnostic models that generalize to unseen categories. The next challenge is Referring Expression Counting (REC), where the goal is to count objects based on fine-grained attributes and contextual differences. Existing methods struggle with distinguishing visually similar objects that belong to the same category but correspond to different referring expressions. To address this, we propose C-REX, a novel contrastive learning framework, based on supervised contrastive learning, designed to enhance discriminative representation learning. Unlike prior works, C-REX operates entirely within the image space, avoiding the misalignment issues of image-text contrastive learning, thus providing a more stable contrastive signal. It also guarantees a significantly larger pool of negative samples, leading to improved robustness in the learned representations. Moreover, we showcase that our framework is versatile and generic enough to be applied to other similar tasks like class-agnostic counting. To support our approach, we analyze the key components of sota detection-based models and identify that detecting object centroids instead of bounding boxes is the key common factor behind their success in counting tasks. We use this insight to design a simple yet effective detection-based baseline to build upon. Our experiments show that C-REX achieves state-of-the-art results in REC, outperforming previous methods by more than 22\% in MAE and more than 10\% in RMSE, while also demonstrating strong performance in class-agnostic counting. Code is available at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/c-rex.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

However, complex disaster scenes with diverse disaster types, geographic regions, and satellite sensors have posed new challenges for VLM applications. To fill this gap, we curate a remote sensing vision-language dataset (DisasterM3) for global-scale disaster assessment and response. DisasterM3 includes 26,988 bi-temporal satellite images and 123k instruction pairs across 5 continents, with three characteristics: 1) Multi-hazard: DisasterM3 involves 36 historical disaster events with significant impacts, which are categorized into 10 common natural and man-made disasters. 2)Multi-sensor: Extreme weather during disasters often hinders optical sensor imaging, making it necessary to combine Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for post-disaster scenes. 3) Multi-task: Based on real-world scenarios, DisasterM3 includes 9 disaster-related visual perception and reasoning tasks, harnessing the full potential of VLM's reasoning ability with progressing from disaster-bearing body recognition to structural damage assessment and object relational reasoning, culminating in the generation of long-form disaster reports. We extensively evaluated 14 generic and remote sensing VLMs on our benchmark, revealing that state-of-the-art models struggle with the disaster tasks, largely due to the lack of a disaster-specific corpus, cross-sensor gap, and damage object counting insensitivity. Focusing on these issues, we fine-tune four VLMs using our dataset and achieve stable improvements across all tasks, with robust cross-sensor and cross-disaster generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>A mul...</summary><p>A multi-hazard, multi-sensor, and multi-task vision-language dataset for global-scale disaster assessment and response</p></details> |

Mainstream Object-Centric Learning (OCL) methods adopt Slot Attention or its variants to iteratively aggregate objects' super-pixels into a fixed set of query feature vectors, termed slots. However, their reliance on a static slot count leads to an object being represented as multiple parts when the number of objects varies. We introduce MetaSlot, a plug-and-play Slot Attention variant that adapts to variable object counts. MetaSlot (i) maintains a codebook that holds prototypes of objects in a dataset by vector-quantizing the resulting slot representations; (ii) removes duplicate slots from the traditionally aggregated slots by quantizing them with the codebook; and (iii) injects progressively weaker noise into the Slot Attention iterations to accelerate and stabilize the aggregation. MetaSlot is a general Slot Attention variant that can be seamlessly integrated into existing OCL architectures. Across multiple public datasets and tasks--including object discovery and recognition--models equipped with MetaSlot achieve significant performance gains and markedly interpretable slot representations, compared with existing Slot Attention variants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal LLM-Guided Semantic Correction in Text-to-Image Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20053v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become the mainstream architecture for text-to-image generation, achieving remarkable progress in visual quality and prompt controllability. However, current inference pipelines generally lack interpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the denoising process. Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of the final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making them ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative trajectory. As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial errors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising prompt-image alignment and image quality. To tackle these challenges, we propose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel framework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference. PPAD performs real-time analysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic inconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that actively guide the remaining denoising steps. The framework supports both inference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction at only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPAD's significant improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expanding Zero-Shot Object Counting with Rich Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15398v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expanding pre-trained zero-shot counting models to handle unseen categories requires more than simply adding new prompts, as this approach does not achieve the necessary alignment between text and visual features for accurate counting. We introduce RichCount, the first framework to address these limitations, employing a two-stage training strategy that enhances text encoding and strengthens the model's association with objects in images. RichCount improves zero-shot counting for unseen categories through two key objectives: (1) enriching text features with a feed-forward network and adapter trained on text-image similarity, thereby creating robust, aligned representations; and (2) applying this refined encoder to counting tasks, enabling effective generalization across diverse prompts and complex images. In this manner, RichCount goes beyond simple prompt expansion to establish meaningful feature alignment that supports accurate counting across novel categories. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RichCount, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot counting and significantly enhancing generalization to unseen categories in open-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

One potential approach is to utilize Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to build a self-correction framework. However, these approaches are highly dependent on the capabilities of the employed MLLM, often failing to account for all objects within the image. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that employs Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting, enhancing image-text alignment and facilitating more coherent multi-object image editing. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, decomposing the self-correction task into object-level subtasks according to three critical dimensions: counting, attributes, and spatial relationships. We construct a multi-agent self-correcting system featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To resolve the problem of subtask integration, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother that employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtask results, thereby enhancing runtime efficiency while eliminating multi-stage distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Towards Enhanced Chart and Geometry Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11492v3)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, yet they often struggle with visual arithmetic, seemingly simple capabilities like object counting or length comparison, which are essential for relevant complex tasks like chart understanding and geometric reasoning. In this work, we first investigate the root causes of this deficiency through a suite of probing tasks focusing on basic visual arithmetic. Our analysis reveals that while pre-trained vision encoders typically capture sufficient information, the text decoder often fails to decode it correctly for arithmetic reasoning. To address this, we propose CogAlign, a novel post-training strategy inspired by Piaget's theory of cognitive development. CogAlign trains VLMs to recognize invariant properties under visual transformations. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the performance of three diverse VLMs on our proposed probing tasks. Furthermore, CogAlign enhances performance by an average of 4.6% on CHOCOLATE and 2.9% on MATH-VISION, outperforming or matching supervised fine-tuning methods while requiring only 60% less training data. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of CogAlign in improving fundamental visual arithmetic capabilities and their transfer to downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data are available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/CogAlign</p></details> |

However, existing open-vocabulary and visual grounding methods rely on explicit category cues, limiting their ability to handle complex or implicit queries that require advanced reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce a new suite of tasks, including Instruction-Oriented Object Counting, Detection, and Segmentation (InstructCDS), covering open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass scenarios. We further present EarthInstruct, the first InstructCDS benchmark for earth observation. It is constructed from two diverse remote sensing datasets with varying spatial resolutions and annotation rules across 20 categories, necessitating models to interpret dataset-specific instructions. Given the scarcity of semantically rich labeled data in remote sensing, we propose InstructSAM, a training-free framework for instruction-driven object recognition. InstructSAM leverages large vision-language models to interpret user instructions and estimate object counts, employs SAM2 for mask proposal, and formulates mask-label assignment as a binary integer programming problem. By integrating semantic similarity with counting constraints, InstructSAM efficiently assigns categories to predicted masks without relying on confidence thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that InstructSAM matches or surpasses specialized baselines across multiple tasks while maintaining near-constant inference time regardless of object count, reducing output tokens by 89% and overall runtime by over 32% compared to direct generation approaches. We believe the contributions of the proposed tasks, benchmark, and effective approach will advance future research in developing versatile object recognition systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods rely on CNNs and Transformers, but CNNs struggle to capture global dependencies, and Transformers are computationally expensive, which limits their effectiveness in remote applications. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising solution in the field of computer vision, offering a linear complexity for modeling global dependencies. To this end, we propose Mamba-MOC, a mamba-based network designed for multi-category remote object counting, which represents the first application of Mamba to remote sensing object counting. Specifically, we propose a cross-scale interaction module to facilitate the deep integration of hierarchical features. Then we design a context state space model to capture both global and local contextual information and provide local neighborhood information during the scan process. Experimental results in large-scale realistic scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with some mainstream counting algorithms.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are constrained to basic instruction-following or descriptive tasks, facing challenges in complex real-world remote sensing applications that require specialized tools and knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose RS-Agent, an AI agent designed to interact with human users and autonomously leverage specialized models to address the demands of real-world remote sensing applications. RS-Agent integrates four key components: a Central Controller based on large language models, a dynamic toolkit for tool execution, a Solution Space for task-specific expert guidance, and a Knowledge Space for domain-level reasoning, enabling it to interpret user queries and orchestrate tools for accurate remote sensing task. We introduce two novel mechanisms: Task-Aware Retrieval, which improves tool selection accuracy through expert-guided planning, and DualRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation method that enhances knowledge relevance through weighted, dual-path retrieval. RS-Agent supports flexible integration of new tools and is compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets and 18 remote sensing tasks demonstrate that RS-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs, achieving over 95% task planning accuracy and delivering superior performance in tasks such as scene classification, object counting, and remote sensing visual question answering. Our work presents RS-Agent as a robust and extensible framework for advancing intelligent automation in remote sensing analysis.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in visual-spatial reasoning, most studies focus on standard pinhole-view images, leaving omnidirectional perception largely unexplored. In this paper, we ask: Are MLLMs ready for omnidirectional spatial reasoning? To investigate this, we introduce OSR-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed for this setting. OSR-Bench includes over 153,000 diverse question-answer pairs grounded in high-fidelity panoramic indoor scene maps. It covers key reasoning types including object counting, relative distance, and direction. We also propose a negative sampling strategy that inserts non-existent objects into prompts to evaluate hallucination and grounding robustness. For fine-grained analysis, we design a two-stage evaluation framework assessing both cognitive map generation and QA accuracy using rotation-invariant matching and a combination of rule-based and LLM-based metrics. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and leading open-source models under zero-shot settings. Results show that current models struggle with spatial reasoning in panoramic contexts, highlighting the need for more perceptually grounded MLLMs. OSR-Bench and code will be released at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/UUUserna/OSR-Bench</p></details> |  |

Consequently, we are witnessing growing interests in integrating additional structural constraints, typically in the form of coarse bounding boxes, to better guide the generation process in such challenging cases. In this work, we take the idea of structural guidance a step further by making the observation that contemporary image generation models can directly provide a plausible fine-grained structural initialization. We propose a technique that couples this image-based structural guidance with LLM-based instance-level instructions, yielding output images that adhere to all parts of the text prompt, including object counts, instance-level attributes, and spatial relations between instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH 2025.

Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1) abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g., occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic, interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal generative models.</p></details> |  |

However, these datasets are often extracted from noisy data scraped from the web, and contain many mislabeled instances. In order to improve the reliability of downstream models, it is important to identify and filter images with incorrect captions. However, beyond filtering based on image-caption embedding similarity, no prior works have proposed other methods to filter noisy multimodal data, or concretely assessed the impact of noisy captioning data on downstream training. In this work, we propose, theoretically justify, and empirically validate LEMoN, a method to identify label errors in image-caption datasets. Our method leverages the multimodal neighborhood of image-caption pairs in the latent space of contrastively pretrained multimodal models to automatically identify label errors. Through empirical evaluations across eight datasets and twelve baselines, we find that LEMoN outperforms the baselines by over 3% in label error detection, and that training on datasets filtered using our method improves downstream captioning performance by more than 2 BLEU points over noisy training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICML 2025</p></details> |

It is little surprise that computational methods that estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these properties for classification.

High-quality captions require a balance between precision and recall, which remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we hypothesize that this limitation stems from weakening and increasingly noisy visual attention as responses lengthen. To address this issue, we propose SPARC (Selective Progressive Attention ReCalibration), a training-free method that enhances the contribution of visual tokens during decoding. SPARC is founded on three key observations: (1) increasing the influence of all visual tokens reduces recall; thus, SPARC selectively amplifies visual tokens; (2) as captions lengthen, visual attention becomes noisier, so SPARC identifies critical visual tokens by leveraging attention differences across time steps; (3) as visual attention gradually weakens, SPARC reinforces it to preserve its influence. Our experiments, incorporating both automated and human evaluations, demonstrate that existing methods improve the precision of MLLMs at the cost of recall. In contrast, our proposed method enhances both precision and recall with minimal computational overhead.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

In industrial automation such as robotics and rugged edge AI, real-time perception and intelligence are critical for autonomous operations. Deploying transformer-based image captioning models at the edge can enhance machine perception, improve scene understanding for autonomous robots, and aid in industrial inspection. However, these edge or IoT devices are often constrained in computational resources for physical agility, yet they have strict response time requirements. Traditional deep learning models can be too large and computationally demanding for these devices. In this research, we present findings of transformer-based models for image captioning that operate effectively on edge devices. By evaluating resource-effective transformer models and applying knowledge distillation techniques, we demonstrate inference can be accelerated on resource-constrained devices while maintaining model performance using these techniques.</p></details> |  |

Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; Project Page, Code, and Dataset at: https://merit-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

Prompt inversion, the task of identifying the textual prompt used to generate a specific artifact, holds significant potential for applications including data attribution, model provenance, and watermarking validation. Recent studies introduced a delayed projection scheme to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space, though challenges in semantic fluency and efficiency remain. Advanced image captioning models or visual large language models can generate highly interpretable prompts, but they often lack in image similarity. In this paper, we propose a prompt inversion technique called \sys for text-to-image diffusion models, which includes initializing embeddings using a pre-trained image captioning model, refining them through reverse-engineering in the latent space, and converting them to texts using an embedding-to-text model. Our experiments on the widely-used datasets, such as MS COCO, LAION, and Flickr, show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of image similarity, textual alignment, prompt interpretability and generalizability. We further illustrate the application of our generated prompts in tasks such as cross-concept image synthesis, concept manipulation, evolutionary multi-concept generation and unsupervised segmentation.</p></details> |  |

However, it is still challenging to ensure consistent and robust performance across different languages and cultural contexts, and kids-friendly design requires simplified instructions, engaging interactions, and age-appropriate scaffolding to maintain motivation and optimize learning outcomes. In this work, we introduce SingaKids, a dialogic tutor designed to facilitate language learning through picture description tasks. Our system integrates dense image captioning, multilingual dialogic interaction, speech understanding, and engaging speech generation to create an immersive learning environment in four languages: English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. We further improve the system through multilingual pre-training, task-specific tuning, and scaffolding optimization. Empirical studies with elementary school students demonstrate that SingaKids provides effective dialogic teaching, benefiting learners at different performance levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

Current approaches mainly rely on costly annotations and are not comprehensive -- in terms of evaluating all aspects such as relations, attributes, and dependencies between aspects. Therefore, we introduce the FIHA (autonomous Fine-graIned Hallucination evAluation evaluation in LVLMs), which could access hallucination LVLMs in the LLM-free and annotation-free way and model the dependency between different types of hallucinations. FIHA can generate Q&A pairs on any image dataset at minimal cost, enabling hallucination assessment from both image and caption. Based on this approach, we introduce a benchmark called FIHA-v1, which consists of diverse questions on various images from MSCOCO and Foggy. Furthermore, we use the Davidson Scene Graph (DSG) to organize the structure among Q&A pairs, in which we can increase the reliability of the evaluation. We evaluate representative models using FIHA-v1, highlighting their limitations and challenges. We released our code and data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 2025</p></details> |

These multi-modal representations can benefit various downstream tasks in the biomedical domain. Contrastive learning is widely used to pre-train vision-language models for general natural images and associated captions. Despite its popularity, we found biomedical texts have complex and domain-specific semantics that are often neglected by common contrastive methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, perturbed report discrimination, for pre-train biomedical vision-language models. First, we curate a set of text perturbation methods that keep the same words, but disrupt the semantic structure of the sentence. Next, we apply different types of perturbation to reports, and use the model to distinguish the original report from the perturbed ones given the associated image. Parallel to this, we enhance the sensitivity of our method to higher level of granularity for both modalities by contrasting attention-weighted image sub-regions and sub-words in the image-text pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple downstream tasks, and our method outperforms strong baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach learns more semantic meaningful and robust multi-modal representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, accepted by 2024 IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CAI)</p></details> |

But they underperform on multi-step visual reasoning -- even compared to LLMs on the same tasks presented in text form -- giving rise to perceptions of modality imbalance or brittleness. Towards a systematic study of such issues, we introduce a synthetic framework for assessing the ability of VLMs to perform algorithmic visual reasoning, comprising three tasks: Table Readout, Grid Navigation, and Visual Analogy. Each has two levels of difficulty, SIMPLE and HARD, and even the SIMPLE versions are difficult for frontier VLMs. We propose strategies for training on the SIMPLE version of tasks that improve performance on the corresponding HARD task, i.e., simple-to-hard (S2H) generalization. This controlled setup, where each task also has an equivalent text-only version, allows a quantification of the modality imbalance and how it is impacted by training strategy. We show that 1) explicit image-to-text conversion is important in promoting S2H generalization on images, by transferring reasoning from text; 2) conversion can be internalized at test time. We also report results of mechanistic study of this phenomenon. We identify measures of gradient alignment that can identify training strategies that promote better S2H generalization. Ablations highlight the importance of chain-of-thought.</p></details> |  |

To address the limitations, we propose a simple yet effective strategy for generating and calibrating distributions of CLIPScore values. Leveraging a model-agnostic conformal risk control framework, we calibrate CLIPScore values for task-specific control variables, tackling the aforementioned limitations. Experimental results demonstrate that using conformal risk control, over score distributions produced with simple methods such as input masking, can achieve competitive performance compared to more complex approaches. Our method effectively detects erroneous words, while providing formal guarantees aligned with desired risk levels. It also improves the correlation between uncertainty estimations and prediction errors, thus enhancing the overall reliability of caption evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Findings ACL 2025</p></details> |

Unlike prior methods limited to specific image types (e.g., natural images or geometric visuals), our framework provides a unified solution for captioning natural images, visual text (e.g., posters, UIs, textbooks), and structured visuals (e.g., documents, tables, charts). By converting low-level pixel information into semantically rich textual representations, our framework bridges the gap between visual and textual modalities. Our results highlight three key advantages: (i) Enhanced Visual Reasoning with LLMs, where long-context captions of visual modalities empower LLMs, particularly the DeepSeek-R1 series, to reason effectively in multimodal scenarios; (ii) Improved Image Generation, where detailed captions improve tasks like text-to-image generation and image transformation; and (iii) Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which enables faster convergence with less data. We believe the versatility and adaptability of OmniCaptioner can offer a new perspective for bridging the gap between language and visual modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>More ...</summary><p>More visualizations on Homepage: https://alpha-innovator.github.io/OmniCaptioner-project-page and Official code: https://github.com/Alpha-Innovator/OmniCaptioner</p></details> |

In this paper, we establish Aesthetic-4K, a meticulously curated dataset containing dedicated training and evaluation subsets specifically designed for comprehensive research on ultra-high-resolution image synthesis. This dataset consists of high-quality 4K images accompanied by descriptive captions generated by GPT-4o. Furthermore, we propose Diffusion-4K, an innovative framework for the direct generation of ultra-high-resolution images. Our approach incorporates the Scale Consistent Variational Auto-Encoder (SC-VAE) and Wavelet-based Latent Fine-tuning (WLF), which are designed for efficient visual token compression and the capture of intricate details in ultra-high-resolution images, thereby facilitating direct training with photorealistic 4K data. This method is applicable to various latent diffusion models and demonstrates its efficacy in synthesizing highly detailed 4K images. Additionally, we propose novel metrics, namely the GLCM Score and Compression Ratio, to assess the texture richness and fine details in local patches, in conjunction with holistic measures such as FID, Aesthetics, and CLIPScore, enabling a thorough and multifaceted evaluation of ultra-high-resolution image synthesis. Consequently, Diffusion-4K achieves impressive performance in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, particularly when powered by state-of-the-art large-scale diffusion models (eg, Flux-12B).

| **[Disambiguating Reference in Visually Grounded Dialogues through Joint Modeling of Textual and Multimodal Semantic Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11726v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal reference resolution, including phrase grounding, aims to understand the semantic relations between mentions and real-world objects. Phrase grounding between images and their captions is a well-established task. In contrast, for real-world applications, it is essential to integrate textual and multimodal reference resolution to unravel the reference relations within dialogue, especially in handling ambiguities caused by pronouns and ellipses. This paper presents a framework that unifies textual and multimodal reference resolution by mapping mention embeddings to object embeddings and selecting mentions or objects based on their similarity. Our experiments show that learning textual reference resolution, such as coreference resolution and predicate-argument structure analysis, positively affects performance in multimodal reference resolution. In particular, our model with coreference resolution performs better in pronoun phrase grounding than representative models for this task, MDETR and GLIP. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates that incorporating textual reference relations strengthens the confidence scores between mentions, including pronouns and predicates, and objects, which can reduce the ambiguities that arise in visually grounded dialogues.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL20...</summary><p>ACL2025 main.

In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Contrastive Rewarding (HSCR), a novel approach that addresses two critical challenges in Med-VLM alignment: 1) Cost-effective generation of high-quality preference data; 2) Capturing nuanced and context-aware preferences for improved alignment. HSCR first leverages the inherent capability of Med-VLMs to generate dispreferred responses with higher sampling probability. By analyzing output logit shifts after visual token dropout, we identify modality-coupled tokens that induce misalignment and derive an implicit alignment reward function. This function guides token replacement with hallucinated ones during decoding, producing high-quality dispreferred data. Furthermore, HSCR introduces a multi-level preference optimization strategy, which extends beyond traditional adjacent-level optimization by incorporating nuanced implicit preferences, leveraging relative quality in dispreferred data to capture subtle alignment cues for more precise and context-aware optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple medical tasks, including Med-VQA, medical image captioning and instruction following, demonstrate that HSCR not only enhances zero-shot performance but also significantly improves modality alignment and trustworthiness with just 2,000 training entries.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk), an AI-in-the-loop methodology designed to maximize the number of annotated samples and improve their comprehensiveness under fixed budget constraints (e.g., total human annotation time). The framework is built upon two key insights. First, sequential annotation reduces redundant workload compared to conventional parallel annotation, as subsequent annotators only need to annotate the ``residual'' -- the missing visual information that previous annotations have not covered. Second, humans process textual input faster by reading while outputting annotations with much higher throughput via talking; thus a multimodal interface enables optimized efficiency. We evaluate our framework from two aspects: intrinsic evaluations that assess the comprehensiveness of semantic units, obtained by parsing detailed captions into object-attribute trees and analyzing their effective connections; extrinsic evaluation measures the practical usage of the annotated captions in facilitating vision-language alignment. Experiments with eight participants show our Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk) improves annotation speed (0.42 vs. 0.30 units/sec) and retrieval performance (41.13% vs. 40.52%) over the parallel method.</p></details> |  |

SoundSculpt employs an ambisonic-in-ambisonic-out architecture and is conditioned on both spatial information (e.g., target direction obtained by pointing at an immersive video) and semantic embeddings (e.g., derived from image segmentation and captioning). Trained and evaluated on synthetic and real ambisonic mixtures, SoundSculpt demonstrates superior performance compared to various signal processing baselines. Our results further reveal that while spatial conditioning alone can be effective, the combination of spatial and semantic information is beneficial in scenarios where there are secondary sound sources spatially close to the target. Additionally, we compare two different semantic embeddings derived from a text description of the target sound using text encoders.</p></details> |  |

We assess these metrics across multiple dimensions, including correlation with human judgment, ranking accuracy, and sensitivity to hallucinations. Additionally, we explore the challenges posed by the longer and more detailed captions generated by MLLMs and examine the adaptability of current metrics to these stylistic variations. Our analysis highlights some limitations of standard evaluation approaches and suggests promising directions for future research in image captioning assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCAI...</summary><p>IJCAI 2025.

In this work, we investigate whether images can act as cultural context in multimodal translation. We introduce CaMMT, a human-curated benchmark of over 5,800 triples of images along with parallel captions in English and regional languages. Using this dataset, we evaluate five Vision Language Models (VLMs) in text-only and text+image settings. Through automatic and human evaluations, we find that visual context generally improves translation quality, especially in handling Culturally-Specific Items (CSIs), disambiguation, and correct gender usage. By releasing CaMMT, we aim to support broader efforts in building and evaluating multimodal translation systems that are better aligned with cultural nuance and regional variation.</p></details> |  |

However, without explicit structural priors -- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing -- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[On Minimizers of Minimum Density](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05277v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Minimizers are sampling schemes with numerous applications in computational biology. Assuming a fixed alphabet of size $\sigma$, a minimizer is defined by two integers $k,w\ge2$ and a linear order $\rho$ on strings of length $k$ (also called $k$-mers). A string is processed by a sliding window algorithm that chooses, in each window of length $w+k-1$, its minimal $k$-mer with respect to $\rho$. A key characteristic of the minimizer is its density, which is the expected frequency of chosen $k$-mers among all $k$-mers in a random infinite $\sigma$-ary string. Minimizers of smaller density are preferred as they produce smaller samples with the same guarantee: each window is represented by a $k$-mer. The problem of finding a minimizer of minimum density for given input parameters $(\sigma,k,w)$ has a huge search space of $(\sigma^k)!$ and is representable by an ILP of size $\tilde\Theta(\sigma^{k+w})$, which has worst-case solution time that is doubly-exponential in $(k+w)$ under standard complexity assumptions. We solve this problem in $w\cdot 2^{\sigma^k+O(k)}$ time and provide several additional tricks reducing the practical runtime and search space. As a by-product, we describe an algorithm computing the average density of a minimizer within the same time bound. Then we propose a novel method of studying minimizers via regular languages and show how to find, via the eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis over finite automata, minimizers with the minimal density in the asymptotic case $w\to\infty$. Implementing our algorithms, we compute the minimum density minimizers for $(\sigma,k)\in\{(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(4,2)\}$ and \textbf{all} $w\ge 2$. The obtained densities are compared against the average density and the theoretical lower bounds, including the new bound presented in this paper.</p></details> | 30 pages, 4 figures |

Existing CoVR benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image, video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR, TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Top-Down Pseudo-Boolean Model Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05232v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pseudo-Boolean model counting involves computing the number of satisfying assignments of a given pseudo-Boolean (PB) formula. In recent years, PB model counting has seen increased interest partly owing to the succinctness of PB formulas over typical propositional Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF) at describing problem constraints. In particular, the research community has developed tools to tackle exact PB model counting. These recently developed counters follow one of the two existing major designs for model counters, namely the bottom-up model counter design. A natural question would be whether the other major design, the top-down model counter paradigm, would be effective at PB model counting, especially when the top-down design offered superior performance in CNF model counting literature. In this work, we investigate the aforementioned top-down design for PB model counting and introduce the first exact top-down PB model counter, PBMC. PBMC is a top-down search-based counter for PB formulas, with a new variable decision heuristic that considers variable coefficients. Through our evaluations, we highlight the superior performance of PBMC at PB model counting compared to the existing state-of-the-art counters PBCount, PBCounter, and Ganak. In particular, PBMC could count for 1849 instances while the next-best competing method, PBCount, could only count for 1773 instances, demonstrating the potential of a top-down PB counter design.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SAT 2025</p></details> |

However, computing exact Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco & Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods, tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results compared to the KernelSHAP library.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Most methods typically follow a two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection? To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly, these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation, strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions. Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set.

Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one- and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks (equivalently, the attention mechanism).</p></details> |  |

In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy under ambient illumination.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures and 1 table</p></details> |

However, significant aerial phase force (e.g., thrust and drag) can invalidate this assumption and lead to poor estimation performance. To combat this issue, a group has implemented multiple sensors (active and passive optical, inertial, and contact) and significant computational power to achieve full state estimation. This, however, poses a significant challenge to the development of light-weight, high-performance, low observable, jamming and electronic interference resistant hopping systems; especially in perceptually degraded environments (e.g., dust, smoke). Here we show a training procedure for a coupled hopping phase and Kalman filter-based vertical state estimator, requiring only inertial measurements, which is able to learn the characteristics of the target system, sensors, locomotion behaviors, environment, and acceleration measurement aliasing conditions. The resulting estimator, given hop heights up to 4 m and velocities up to $\pm7$ m/s, achieves a mean absolute percent error in the hop apex height of 12.5% with an aerial trajectory average normalized mean absolute error in position and velocity of 19% and 16.5%, respectively; while operating at 840 Hz, on a dual-core 240 MHz processor, with a total robot mass of 672 g. Due to the low mass and computational power, the presented estimator could also be used as a degraded operational mode in cases of sensor damage, malfunction, or occlusion in more complex robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features for RFT-based red teaming.

While deep learning has introduced powerful paradigms to this field, persistent challenges in detecting overlapping cells and multi-scale objects hinder practical deployment. This study proposes the multi-scale YOLO (MS-YOLO), a blood cell detection model based on the YOLOv11 framework, incorporating three key architectural innovations to enhance detection performance. Specifically, the multi-scale dilated residual module (MS-DRM) replaces the original C3K2 modules to improve multi-scale discriminability; the dynamic cross-path feature enhancement module (DCFEM) enables the fusion of hierarchical features from the backbone with aggregated features from the neck to enhance feature representations; and the light adaptive-weight downsampling module (LADS) improves feature downsampling through adaptive spatial weighting while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the CBC benchmark demonstrate that MS-YOLO achieves precise detection of overlapping cells and multi-scale objects, particularly small targets such as platelets, achieving an mAP@50 of 97.4% that outperforms existing models. Further validation on the supplementary WBCDD dataset confirms its robust generalization capability. Additionally, with a lightweight architecture and real-time inference efficiency, MS-YOLO meets clinical deployment requirements, providing reliable technical support for standardized blood pathology assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMAR: Towards Lossless Multi-Modal Auto-Regressive Probabilistic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10798v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multi-modal large language models have propelled the development of joint probabilistic models capable of both image understanding and generation. However, we have identified that recent methods suffer from loss of image information during understanding task, due to either image discretization or diffusion denoising steps. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Auto-Regressive (MMAR) probabilistic modeling framework. Unlike discretization line of method, MMAR takes in continuous-valued image tokens to avoid information loss in an efficient way. Differing from diffusion-based approaches, we disentangle the diffusion process from auto-regressive backbone model by employing a light-weight diffusion head on top each auto-regressed image patch embedding. In this way, when the model transits from image generation to understanding through text generation, the backbone model's hidden representation of the image is not limited to the last denoising step. To successfully train our method, we also propose a theoretically proven technique that addresses the numerical stability issue and a training strategy that balances the generation and understanding task goals. Extensive evaluations on 18 image understanding benchmarks show that MMAR significantly outperforms most of the existing joint multi-modal models, surpassing the method that employs pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. Meanwhile, MMAR is able to generate high quality images. We also show that our method is scalable with larger data and model size.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain a concrete visual definition of the informative structures because influences of visual features are task-specific. In this paper, we propose a single general neural network architecture for extracting task-specific structure guidance for scenes. To do this, we first analyze traditional spectral clustering methods, which computes a set of eigenvectors to model a segmented graph forming small compact structures on image domains. We then unfold the traditional graph-partitioning problem into a learnable network, named \textit{Scene Structure Guidance Network (SSGNet)}, to represent the task-specific informative structures. The SSGNet yields a set of coefficients of eigenvectors that produces explicit feature representations of image structures. In addition, our SSGNet is light-weight ($\sim$ 56K parameters), and can be used as a plug-and-play module for off-the-shelf architectures. We optimize the SSGNet without any supervision by proposing two novel training losses that enforce task-specific scene structure generation during training. Our main contribution is to show that such a simple network can achieve state-of-the-art results for several low-level vision applications. We also demonstrate that our network generalizes well on unseen datasets, compared to existing methods which use structural embedding frameworks. We further propose a lighter version of SSGNet ($\sim$ 29K parameters) for depth computation, SSGNet-D, and successfully execute it on edge computing devices like Jetson AGX Orin, improving the performance of baseline network, even in the wild, with little computational delay.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 14 figures, journal extension version of SSGNet (https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/25322)</p></details> |

Previous analyses suggest that DPS accomplishes posterior sampling by approximating the conditional score. While in this paper, we demonstrate that the conditional score approximation employed by DPS is not as effective as previously assumed, but rather aligns more closely with the principle of maximizing a posterior (MAP). This assertion is substantiated through an examination of DPS on 512x512 ImageNet images, revealing that: 1) DPS's conditional score estimation significantly diverges from the score of a well-trained conditional diffusion model and is even inferior to the unconditional score; 2) The mean of DPS's conditional score estimation deviates significantly from zero, rendering it an invalid score estimation; 3) DPS generates high-quality samples with significantly lower diversity. In light of the above findings, we posit that DPS more closely resembles MAP than a conditional score estimator, and accordingly propose the following enhancements to DPS: 1) we explicitly maximize the posterior through multi-step gradient ascent and projection; 2) we utilize a light-weighted conditional score estimator trained with only 100 images and 8 GPU hours. Extensive experimental results indicate that these proposed improvements significantly enhance DPS's performance. The source code for these improvements is provided in https://github.com/tongdaxu/Rethinking-Diffusion-Posterior-Sampling-From-Conditional-Score-Estimator-to-Maximizing-a-Posterior.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Inspired by prevailing practices in unified model learning, we adopt an efficient training strategy that minimizes the training complexity and overhead by bridging the off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models through a set of learnable queries and a light-weight transformer-based connector. With a minimalist choice of architecture, we demonstrate that OpenUni can: 1) generate high-quality and instruction-aligned images, and 2) achieve exceptional performance on standard benchmarks such as GenEval, DPG- Bench, and WISE, with only 1.1B and 3.1B activated parameters.

Future public health efforts must attempt to understand such content, what concerns it may raise among readers, and how to effectively respond to it. To this end, we present ConcernScope, a platform that uses a teacher-student framework for knowledge transfer between large language models and light-weight classifiers to quickly and effectively identify the health concerns raised in a text corpus. The platform allows uploading massive files directly, automatically scraping specific URLs, and direct text editing. ConcernScope is built on top of a taxonomy of public health concerns. Intended for public health officials, we demonstrate several applications of this platform: guided data exploration to find useful examples of common concerns found in online community datasets, identification of trends in concerns through an example time series analysis of 186,000 samples, and finding trends in topic frequency before and after significant events.</p></details> | 19 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Approximate Light Spanners in Planar Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24825v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In their seminal paper, Alth\"{o}fer et al. (DCG 1993) introduced the {\em greedy spanner} and showed that, for any weighted planar graph $G$, the weight of the greedy $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner is at most $(1+\frac{2}{\epsilon}) \cdot w(MST(G))$, where $w(MST(G))$ is the weight of a minimum spanning tree $MST(G)$ of $G$. This bound is optimal in an {\em existential sense}: there exist planar graphs $G$ for which any $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner has a weight of at least $(1+\frac{2}{\epsilon}) \cdot w(MST(G))$. However, as an {\em approximation algorithm}, even for a {\em bicriteria} approximation, the weight approximation factor of the greedy spanner is essentially as large as the existential bound: There exist planar graphs $G$ for which the greedy $(1+x \epsilon)$-spanner (for any $1\leq x = O(\epsilon^{-1/2})$) has a weight of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\epsilon \cdot x^2})\cdot w(G_{OPT, \epsilon})$, where $G_{OPT, \epsilon}$ is a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner of $G$ of minimum weight. Despite the flurry of works over the past three decades on approximation algorithms for spanners as well as on light(-weight) spanners, there is still no (possibly bicriteria) approximation algorithm for light spanners in weighted planar graphs that outperforms the existential bound. As our main contribution, we present a polynomial time algorithm for constructing, in any weighted planar graph $G$, a $(1+\epsilon\cdot 2^{O(\log^* 1/\epsilon)})$-spanner for $G$ of total weight $O(1)\cdot w(G_{OPT, \epsilon})$. To achieve this result, we develop a new technique, which we refer to as {\em iterative planar pruning}. It iteratively modifies a spanner [...]</p></details> | <details><summary>Abstr...</summary><p>Abstract shortened to meet arXiv limit</p></details> |

Detection of CRC at early stages is crucial for increasing patient survival rates. However, colonoscopy is dependent on obtaining adequate and high-quality endoscopic images. Prolonged invasive procedures are inherently risky for patients, while suboptimal or insufficient images hamper diagnostic accuracy. These images, typically derived from video frames, often exhibit similar patterns, posing challenges in discrimination. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Deep Learning network built on a Few-Shot Learning architecture, which includes a tailored feature extractor, task interpolation, relational embedding, and a bi-level routing attention mechanism. The Few-Shot Learning paradigm enables our model to rapidly adapt to unseen fine-grained endoscopic image patterns, and the task interpolation augments the insufficient images artificially from varied instrument viewpoints. Our relational embedding approach discerns critical intra-image features and captures inter-image transitions between consecutive endoscopic frames, overcoming the limitations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The integration of a light-weight attention mechanism ensures a concentrated analysis of pertinent image regions. By training on diverse datasets, the model's generalizability and robustness are notably improved for handling endoscopic images. Evaluated on Kvasir dataset, our model demonstrated superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 90.1\%, precision of 0.845, recall of 0.942, and an F1 score of 0.891. This surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, presenting a promising solution to the challenges of invasive colonoscopy by optimizing CRC detection through advanced image analysis.</p></details> | 6 pages, 15 figures |

Despite an already mature research endeavour for photos, there is no research on the efficient inference specifically designed for sketch data. In this paper, we first demonstrate existing state-of-the-art efficient light-weight models designed for photos do not work on sketches. We then propose two sketch-specific components which work in a plug-n-play manner on any photo efficient network to adapt them to work on sketch data. We specifically chose fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) as a demonstrator as the most recognised sketch problem with immediate commercial value. Technically speaking, we first propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation network to transfer existing photo efficient networks to be compatible with sketch, which brings down number of FLOPs and model parameters by 97.96% percent and 84.89% respectively. We then exploit the abstract trait of sketch to introduce a RL-based canvas selector that dynamically adjusts to the abstraction level which further cuts down number of FLOPs by two thirds. The end result is an overall reduction of 99.37% of FLOPs (from 40.18G to 0.254G) when compared with a full network, while retaining the accuracy (33.03% vs 32.77%) -- finally making an efficient network for the sparse sketch data that exhibit even fewer FLOPs than the best photo counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025, Project Page: https://subhajitmaity.me/SketchDownTheFLOPs</p></details> |

However, deploying such models on low resource devices is impractical despite of their favorable performance. Existing approaches (pruning, distillation, layer skip etc.) transform the large models into smaller ones at the cost of significant performance degradation or require prolonged training of smaller models for better performance. To address these issues, we introduce an efficacious two-step representation learning based approach capable of producing several small sized models from a single large model ensuring considerably better performance in limited number of epochs. Comprehensive experimentation on ASR benchmarks reveals the efficacy of our approach, achieving three-fold training speed-up and up to 12.54% word error rate improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at InterSpeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Subscedastic weighted least squares estimates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00753v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the heteroscedastic linear model, the weighted least squares (WLS) estimate of the model coefficients is more efficient than the ordinary least squares (OLS) esti- mate. However, the practical application of WLS is challenging because it requires knowledge of the error variances. Feasible weighted least squares (FLS) estimates, which use approximations of the variances when they are unknown, may either be more or less efficient than the OLS estimate depending on the quality of the approx- imation. A direct comparison between FLS and OLS has significant implications for the application of regression analysis in varied fields, yet such a comparison remains an unresolved challenge. In this study, we address this challenge by identifying the conditions under which FLS estimates using fixed weights demonstrate greater effi- ciency than the OLS estimate. These conditions provide guidance for the design of feasible estimates using random weights. They also shed light on how certain robust regression estimates behave with respect to the linear model with normal errors of unequal variance.</p></details> |  |

Automatically notifying users whether their queries leak privacy and which phrases leak what private information has therefore become a practical need. Existing privacy detection methods, however, were designed for different objectives and application scenarios, typically tagging personally identifiable information (PII) in anonymous content. In this work, to support the development and evaluation of privacy detection models for LLM interactions that are deployable on local user devices, we construct a large-scale multilingual dataset with 249K user queries and 154K annotated privacy phrases. In particular, we build an automated privacy annotation pipeline with cloud-based strong LLMs to automatically extract privacy phrases from dialogue datasets and annotate leaked information. We also design evaluation metrics at the levels of privacy leakage, extracted privacy phrase, and privacy information. We further establish baseline methods using light-weight LLMs with both tuning-free and tuning-based methods, and report a comprehensive evaluation of their performance. Evaluation results reveal a gap between current performance and the requirements of real-world LLM applications, motivating future research into more effective local privacy detection methods grounded in our dataset.</p></details> | 9 content pages |
| **[Adaptive Backtracking Line Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13150v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backtracking line search is foundational in numerical optimization. The basic idea is to adjust the step-size of an algorithm by a constant factor until some chosen criterion (e.g. Armijo, Descent Lemma) is satisfied. We propose a novel way to adjust step-sizes, replacing the constant factor used in regular backtracking with one that takes into account the degree to which the chosen criterion is violated, with no additional computational burden. This light-weight adjustment leads to significantly faster optimization, which we confirm by performing a variety of experiments on over fifteen real world datasets. For convex problems, we prove adaptive backtracking requires no more adjustments to produce a feasible step-size than regular backtracking does. For nonconvex smooth problems, we prove adaptive backtracking enjoys the same guarantees of regular backtracking. Furthermore, we prove adaptive backtracking preserves the convergence rates of gradient descent and its accelerated variant.</p></details> |  |

The majority of existing continual learning approaches in the literature rely on heuristics and do not provide learning guarantees. In this paper, we present a new method called Continual Pick-to-Learn (CoP2L), which is able to retain the most representative samples for each task in an efficient way. CoP2L combines the Pick-to-Learn algorithm (rooted in the sample compression theory) and the experience replay continual learning scheme. This allows us to provide non-vacuous upper bounds on the generalization loss of the learned predictors, numerically computable after each task. We empirically evaluate our approach on several standard continual learning benchmarks across Class-Incremental, Task-Incremental, and Domain-Incremental settings. Our results show that CoP2L is highly competitive across all setups, often outperforming existing baselines, and significantly mitigating catastrophic forgetting compared to vanilla experience replay in the Class-Incremental setting. It is possible to leverage the bounds provided by CoP2L in practical scenarios to certify the predictor reliability on previously learned tasks, in order to improve the trustworthiness of the continual learning algorithm.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method eliminates the limitations of exemplar selection in replay-based approaches for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in federated continual learning (FCL). The limitations particularly related to the heterogeneity of information density of each summarized data. Our approach maintains the consistency of training gradients and the relationship to past tasks for the summarized exemplars to represent the streaming data compared to the original images effectively. Additionally, our approach reduces the information-level heterogeneity of the summarized data by inter-client sharing of the disentanglement generative model. Extensive experiments show that our ECoral outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and can be seamlessly integrated with many existing approaches to enhance performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class Incremental Learning for Algorithm Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01545v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithm selection is commonly used to predict the best solver from a portfolio per per-instance. In many real scenarios, instances arrive in a stream: new instances become available over time, while the number of class labels can also grow as new data distributions arrive downstream. As a result, the classification model needs to be periodically updated to reflect additional solvers without catastrophic forgetting of past data. In machine-learning (ML), this is referred to as Class Incremental Learning (CIL). While commonly addressed in ML settings, its relevance to algorithm-selection in optimisation has not been previously studied. Using a bin-packing dataset, we benchmark 8 continual learning methods with respect to their ability to withstand catastrophic forgetting. We find that rehearsal-based methods significantly outperform other CIL methods. While there is evidence of forgetting, the loss is small at around 7%. Hence, these methods appear to be a viable approach to continual learning in streaming optimisation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at GECCO 2025. 4 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[L3A: Label-Augmented Analytic Adaptation for Multi-Label Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00816v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes continually without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Multi-label CIL (MLCIL) extends CIL to a real-world scenario where each sample may belong to multiple classes, introducing several challenges: label absence, which leads to incomplete historical information due to missing labels, and class imbalance, which results in the model bias toward majority classes. To address these challenges, we propose Label-Augmented Analytic Adaptation (L3A), an exemplar-free approach without storing past samples. L3A integrates two key modules. The pseudo-label (PL) module implements label augmentation by generating pseudo-labels for current phase samples, addressing the label absence problem. The weighted analytic classifier (WAC) derives a closed-form solution for neural networks. It introduces sample-specific weights to adaptively balance the class contribution and mitigate class imbalance. Experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that L3A outperforms existing methods in MLCIL tasks.

Unlike prior approaches that primarily focus on regularizing model updates to preserve old information while learning new concepts, FL explicitly balances this trade-off through a bidirectional form of regularization. This approach effectively guides the model to swiftly incorporate new knowledge while actively retaining its old knowledge. FL operates through a two-phase training process and can be seamlessly integrated into various CL methods, including replay, parameter regularization, distillation, and dynamic architecture techniques. In designing FL, we use two distinct knowledge bases: one to enhance plasticity and another to improve stability. FL ensures a more balanced model by utilizing both knowledge bases to regularize model updates. Theoretically, we analyze how the FL mechanism enhances the stability-plasticity balance. Empirically, FL demonstrates tangible improvements over baseline methods within the same training budget. By integrating FL into at least one representative baseline from each CL category, we observed an average accuracy improvement of up to 4.91% in Class-Incremental and 3.51% in Task-Incremental settings on standard image classification benchmarks. Additionally, measurements of the stability-to-plasticity ratio confirm that FL effectively enhances this balance. FL also outperforms state-of-the-art CL methods on more challenging datasets like ImageNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to Neural Networks (Elsevier) in August 2024; and accepted in May 2025 for publication.

Recently, pre-trained models (PTMs) combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) have shown remarkable performance in rehearsal-free CIL without requiring exemplars from previous tasks. However, existing adapter-based methods, which incorporate lightweight learnable modules into PTMs for CIL, create new adapters for each new task, leading to both parameter redundancy and failure to leverage shared knowledge across tasks. In this work, we propose ContinuaL Low-Rank Adaptation (CL-LoRA), which introduces a novel dual-adapter architecture combining \textbf{task-shared adapters} to learn cross-task knowledge and \textbf{task-specific adapters} to capture unique features of each new task. Specifically, the shared adapters utilize random orthogonal matrices and leverage knowledge distillation with gradient reassignment to preserve essential shared knowledge. In addition, we introduce learnable block-wise weights for task-specific adapters, which mitigate inter-task interference while maintaining the model's plasticity. We demonstrate CL-LoRA consistently achieves promising performance under multiple benchmarks with reduced training and inference computation, establishing a more efficient and scalable paradigm for continual learning with pre-trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Buffer-free Class-Incremental Learning with Out-of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23412v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) poses significant challenges in open-world scenarios, where models must not only learn new classes over time without forgetting previous ones but also handle inputs from unknown classes that a closed-set model would misclassify. Recent works address both issues by (i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework, and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets support our findings, offering new insights into the design of efficient and privacy-preserving CIL systems for open-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[IRS: Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22855v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is rapidly emerging as a key focus in computer vision, aiming to develop AI systems capable of continuous improvement, thereby enhancing their value and practicality in diverse real-world applications. In healthcare, continual learning holds great promise for continuously acquired digital pathology data, which is collected in hospitals on a daily basis. However, panoramic segmentation on digital whole slide images (WSIs) presents significant challenges, as it is often infeasible to obtain comprehensive annotations for all potential objects, spanning from coarse structures (e.g., regions and unit objects) to fine structures (e.g., cells). This results in temporally and partially annotated data, posing a major challenge in developing a holistic segmentation framework. Moreover, an ideal segmentation model should incorporate new phenotypes, unseen diseases, and diverse populations, making this task even more complex. In this paper, we introduce a novel and unified Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation (IRS) learning scheme to address temporally acquired, partially annotated data while maintaining out-of-distribution (OOD) continual learning capacity in digital pathology. The key innovation of IRS lies in its ability to realize a new spatial-temporal OOD continual learning paradigm by mathematically modeling anatomical relationships between existing and newly introduced classes through a simple incremental universal proposition matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that the IRS method effectively handles the multi-scale nature of pathological segmentation, enabling precise kidney segmentation across various structures (regions, units, and cells) as well as OOD disease lesions at multiple magnifications. This capability significantly enhances domain generalization, making IRS a robust approach for real-world digital pathology applications.</p></details> |  |

This problem poses two challenges, the interference of similar source-class knowledge in target-class representation learning and the shocks of new target knowledge to old ones. To address them, we propose the Multi-Granularity Class Prototype Topology Distillation (GROTO) algorithm, which effectively transfers the source knowledge to the class-incremental target domain. Concretely, we design the multi-granularity class prototype self-organization module and the prototype topology distillation module. First, we mine the positive classes by modeling accumulation distributions. Next, we introduce multi-granularity class prototypes to generate reliable pseudo-labels, and exploit them to promote the positive-class target feature self-organization. Second, the positive-class prototypes are leveraged to construct the topological structures of source and target feature spaces. Then, we perform the topology distillation to continually mitigate the shocks of new target knowledge to old ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets.

| **[Data-Free Class-Incremental Gesture Recognition with Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20049v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gesture recognition is an important research area in the field of computer vision. Most gesture recognition efforts focus on close-set scenarios, thereby limiting the capacity to effectively handle unseen or novel gestures. We aim to address class-incremental gesture recognition, which entails the ability to accommodate new and previously unseen gestures over time. Specifically, we introduce a Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay (PGPFR) framework for data-free class-incremental gesture recognition. This framework comprises four components: Pseudo Feature Generation with Batch Prototypes (PFGBP), Variational Prototype Replay (VPR) for old classes, Truncated Cross-Entropy (TCE) for new classes, and Continual Classifier Re-Training (CCRT). To tackle the issue of catastrophic forgetting, the PFGBP dynamically generates a diversity of pseudo features in an online manner, leveraging class prototypes of old classes along with batch class prototypes of new classes. Furthermore, the VPR enforces consistency between the classifier's weights and the prototypes of old classes, leveraging class prototypes and covariance matrices to enhance robustness and generalization capabilities. The TCE mitigates the impact of domain differences of the classifier caused by pseudo features. Finally, the CCRT training strategy is designed to prevent overfitting to new classes and ensure the stability of features extracted from old classes. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used gesture recognition datasets, namely SHREC 2017 3D and EgoGesture 3D, demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 11.8\% and 12.8\% in terms of mean global accuracy, respectively.

| **[Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning For Efficient SAR Automatic Target Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19565v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems have rapidly evolved to tackle incremental recognition challenges in operational settings. Data scarcity remains a major hurdle that conventional SAR-ATR techniques struggle to address. To cope with this challenge, we propose a few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) framework based on a dual-branch architecture that focuses on local feature extraction and leverages the discrete Fourier transform and global filters to capture long-term spatial dependencies. This incorporates a lightweight cross-attention mechanism that fuses domain-specific features with global dependencies to ensure robust feature interaction, while maintaining computational efficiency by introducing minimal scale-shift parameters. The framework combines focal loss for class distinction under imbalance and center loss for compact intra-class distributions to enhance class separation boundaries. Experimental results on the MSTAR benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in FSCIL SAR-ATR, attesting to its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Class-Incremental Learning with Hierarchical Generative Prototypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02447v4)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) aims at unburdening the training of deep models by distributing computation across multiple devices (clients) while safeguarding data privacy. On top of that, Federated Continual Learning (FCL) also accounts for data distribution evolving over time, mirroring the dynamic nature of real-world environments. While previous studies have identified Catastrophic Forgetting and Client Drift as primary causes of performance degradation in FCL, we shed light on the importance of Incremental Bias and Federated Bias, which cause models to prioritize classes that are recently introduced or locally predominant, respectively. Our proposal constrains both biases in the last layer by efficiently finetuning a pre-trained backbone using learnable prompts, resulting in clients that produce less biased representations and more biased classifiers. Therefore, instead of solely relying on parameter aggregation, we leverage generative prototypes to effectively balance the predictions of the global model. Our method significantly improves the current State Of The Art, providing an average increase of +7.8% in accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[REAL: Representation Enhanced Analytic Learning for Exemplar-free Class-incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13522v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exemplar-free class-incremental learning (EFCIL) aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning (CIL) without available historical training samples as exemplars. Compared with its exemplar-based CIL counterpart that stores exemplars, EFCIL suffers more from forgetting issues. Recently, a new EFCIL branch named Analytic Continual Learning (ACL) introduces a gradient-free paradigm via Recursive Least-Square, achieving a forgetting-resistant classifier training with a frozen backbone during CIL. However, existing ACL suffers from ineffective representations and insufficient utilization of backbone knowledge. In this paper, we propose a representation-enhanced analytic learning (REAL) to address these problems. To enhance the representation, REAL constructs a dual-stream base pretraining followed by representation enhancing distillation process. The dual-stream base pretraining combines self-supervised contrastive learning for general features and supervised learning for class-specific knowledge, followed by the representation enhancing distillation to merge both streams, enhancing representations for subsequent CIL paradigm. To utilize more knowledge from the backbone, REAL presents a feature fusion buffer to multi-layer backbone features, providing informative features for the subsequent classifier training. Our method can be incorporated into existing ACL techniques and provides more competitive performance. Empirical results demonstrate that, REAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks, outperforming exemplar-free methods and rivaling exemplar-based approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Fair Class-Incremental Learning using Sample Weighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01324v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model fairness is becoming important in class-incremental learning for Trustworthy AI. While accuracy has been a central focus in class-incremental learning, fairness has been relatively understudied. However, naively using all the samples of the current task for training results in unfair catastrophic forgetting for certain sensitive groups including classes. We theoretically analyze that forgetting occurs if the average gradient vector of the current task data is in an "opposite direction" compared to the average gradient vector of a sensitive group, which means their inner products are negative. We then propose a fair class-incremental learning framework that adjusts the training weights of current task samples to change the direction of the average gradient vector and thus reduce the forgetting of underperforming groups and achieve fairness. For various group fairness measures, we formulate optimization problems to minimize the overall losses of sensitive groups while minimizing the disparities among them. We also show the problems can be solved with linear programming and propose an efficient Fairness-aware Sample Weighting (FSW) algorithm. Experiments show that FSW achieves better accuracy-fairness tradeoff results than state-of-the-art approaches on real datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory Is Not the Bottleneck: Cost-Efficient Continual Learning via Weight Space Consolidation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07274v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) has traditionally emphasized minimizing exemplar memory usage, assuming that memory is the primary bottleneck. However, in modern computing environments-particularly those involving large foundation models-memory is inexpensive and abundant, while GPU time constitutes the main cost. This paper re-examines CL under a more realistic setting with sufficient exemplar memory, where the system can retain a representative portion of past data. We find that, under this regime, stability improves due to reduced forgetting, but plasticity diminishes as the model becomes biased toward prior tasks and struggles to adapt to new ones. Notably, even simple baselines like naive replay can match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost. Building on this insight, we propose a lightweight yet effective method called Weight Space Consolidation, which directly operates in the model's weight space via two core mechanisms: (1) rank-based parameter resets to recover plasticity, and (2) weight averaging to enhance stability. Our approach outperforms strong baselines across class-incremental learning with image classifiers and continual instruction tuning with large language models, while requiring only one-third to one-fourth of the training cost. These findings challenge long-standing CL assumptions and establish a new, cost-efficient baseline for real-world continual learning systems where exemplar memory is no longer the limiting factor.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Listen, Analyze, and Adapt to Learn New Attacks: An Exemplar-Free Class Incremental Learning Method for Audio Deepfake Source Tracing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14601v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As deepfake speech becomes common and hard to detect, it is vital to trace its source. Recent work on audio deepfake source tracing (ST) aims to find the origins of synthetic or manipulated speech. However, ST models must adapt to learn new deepfake attacks while retaining knowledge of the previous ones. A major challenge is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose the ability to recognize previously learned attacks. Some continual learning methods help with deepfake detection, but multi-class tasks such as ST introduce additional challenges as the number of classes grows. To address this, we propose an analytic class incremental learning method called AnaST. When new attacks appear, the feature extractor remains fixed, and the classifier is updated with a closed-form analytical solution in one epoch. This approach ensures data privacy, optimizes memory usage, and is suitable for online training. The experiments carried out in this work show that our method outperforms the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Consolidation of Top-Down Modulations Achieves Sparsely Supervised Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14125v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological brains learn continually from a stream of unlabeled data, while integrating specialized information from sparsely labeled examples without compromising their ability to generalize. Meanwhile, machine learning methods are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in this natural learning setting, as supervised specialist fine-tuning degrades performance on the original task. We introduce task-modulated contrastive learning (TMCL), which takes inspiration from the biophysical machinery in the neocortex, using predictive coding principles to integrate top-down information continually and without supervision. We follow the idea that these principles build a view-invariant representation space, and that this can be implemented using a contrastive loss. Then, whenever labeled samples of a new class occur, new affine modulations are learned that improve separation of the new class from all others, without affecting feedforward weights. By co-opting the view-invariance learning mechanism, we then train feedforward weights to match the unmodulated representation of a data sample to its modulated counterparts. This introduces modulation invariance into the representation space, and, by also using past modulations, stabilizes it. Our experiments show improvements in both class-incremental and transfer learning over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, as well as over comparable supervised approaches, using as few as 1% of available labels. Taken together, our work suggests that top-down modulations play a crucial role in balancing stability and plasticity.</p></details> | 33 pages, 5 figures |
| **[StPR: Spatiotemporal Preservation and Routing for Exemplar-Free Video Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13997v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Class-Incremental Learning (VCIL) seeks to develop models that continuously learn new action categories over time without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Unlike traditional Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), VCIL introduces the added complexity of spatiotemporal structures, making it particularly challenging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while effectively capturing both frame-shared semantics and temporal dynamics. Existing approaches either rely on exemplar rehearsal, raising concerns over memory and privacy, or adapt static image-based methods that neglect temporal modeling. To address these limitations, we propose Spatiotemporal Preservation and Routing (StPR), a unified and exemplar-free VCIL framework that explicitly disentangles and preserves spatiotemporal information. First, we introduce Frame-Shared Semantics Distillation (FSSD), which identifies semantically stable and meaningful channels by jointly considering semantic sensitivity and classification contribution. These important semantic channels are selectively regularized to maintain prior knowledge while allowing for adaptation. Second, we design a Temporal Decomposition-based Mixture-of-Experts (TD-MoE), which dynamically routes task-specific experts based on their temporal dynamics, enabling inference without task ID or stored exemplars. Together, StPR effectively leverages spatial semantics and temporal dynamics, achieving a unified, exemplar-free VCIL framework. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics400 show that our method outperforms existing baselines while offering improved interpretability and efficiency in VCIL.

| **[Efficient Federated Class-Incremental Learning of Pre-Trained Models via Task-agnostic Low-rank Residual Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12318v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) reduces communication and computation costs in federated fine-tuning of pre-trained models by updating only a small subset of model parameters. However, existing approaches assume static data distributions, failing to adequately address real-world scenarios where new classes continually emerge, particularly in Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL). FCIL faces two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation caused by non-IID data across clients. Unlike current methods that maintain separate task-specific components or suffer from aggregation noise during parameter aggregation, we propose Federated Task-agnostic Low-rank Residual Adaptation (Fed-TaLoRA), a novel parameter-efficient approach for fine-tuning in resource-constrained FCIL scenarios. Specifically, we fine-tune only shared task-agnostic LoRA parameters across sequential tasks, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting while enabling efficient knowledge transfer among clients. Based on a theoretical analysis of aggregation, we develop a novel residual weight update mechanism that ensures accurate knowledge consolidation with minimal overhead. Our methodological innovations are attributed to three key strategies: task-agnostic adaptation, post-aggregation model calibration, and strategic placement of LoRA modules. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Fed-TaLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse data heterogeneity scenarios while substantially reducing resource requirements.</p></details> |  |
