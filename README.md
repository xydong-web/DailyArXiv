| **[Modulation Schemes for Functionalized Vesicle-based MC Transmitters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25676v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular communication (MC) enables information exchange through the transmission of signaling molecules (SMs) and holds promise for many innovative applications. However, most existing works in MC rely on simplified transmitter (TX) models that do not account for the physical and biochemical limitations of realistic biological hardware and environments. This work extends previous efforts toward developing models for practical MC systems by proposing a more realistic TX model that incorporates the delay in SM release and TX noise introduced by biological components. Building on this more realistic, functionalized vesicle-based TX model, we propose two novel modulation schemes specifically designed for this TX to mitigate TX-induced memory effects that arise from delayed and imperfectly controllable SM release. The proposed modulation schemes enable low-complexity receiver designs by mitigating memory effects directly at the TX. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed schemes improve communication reliability under realistic biochemical constraints, offering an important step toward physically realizable MC systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Large language models as uncertainty-calibrated optimizers for experimental discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06265v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific discovery increasingly depends on efficient experimental optimization to navigate vast design spaces under time and resource constraints. Traditional approaches often require extensive domain expertise and feature engineering. While large language models, with their vast scientific knowledge, circumvent the feature engineering limitations, they lack the calibrated uncertainty estimates required for high-stakes decision making. Hence, current optimization methods force a choice between domain knowledge and reliability, with no principled approach that affords both. In this work, we show that training language models through the uncertainty-aware objectives of traditional optimization methods enables their use as reliable optimizers guided by natural language. By teaching LLMs from experimental outcomes under uncertainty, we transform their overconfidence from a fundamental limitation into a precise calibration mechanism. Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reactions, a cornerstone of pharmaceutical synthesis, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-yielding reaction conditions, from 24% to 43% in 50 experimental iterations starting from 10 unsuccessful conditions. Across 19 diverse optimization problems spanning organic synthesis, materials science and catalysis, process chemistry, and molecular design, our approach ranks first on average, establishing a new paradigm for reliable, uncertainty-guided optimization with LLMs. Our approach can accelerate discovery by lowering the barrier to using powerful optimization methods, replacing the need for domain-specific feature engineering with more accessible natural language interfaces. These findings highlight that ensuring reliability through principled uncertainty quantification is critical for realizing the full potential of AI-guided experimentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Linear Probing to Joint-Weighted Token Hierarchy: A Foundation Model Bridging Global and Cellular Representations in Biomarker Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05150v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-based biomarkers can infer molecular features directly from hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) slides, yet most pathology foundation models (PFMs) rely on global patch-level embeddings and overlook cell-level morphology. We present a PFM model, JWTH (Joint-Weighted Token Hierarchy), which integrates large-scale self-supervised pretraining with cell-centric post-tuning and attention pooling to fuse local and global tokens. Across four tasks involving four biomarkers and eight cohorts, JWTH achieves up to 8.3% higher balanced accuracy and 1.2% average improvement over prior PFMs, advancing interpretable and robust AI-based biomarker detection in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

| **[SPECTRA: Spectral Target-Aware Graph Augmentation for Imbalanced Molecular Property Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04838v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In molecular property prediction, the most valuable compounds (e.g., high potency) often occupy sparse regions of the target space. Standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis; and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions, SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy. On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.</p></details> |  |
| **[On scalable and efficient training of diffusion samplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19552v4)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of training diffusion models to sample from unnormalized energy distributions in the absence of data, the so-called diffusion samplers. Although these approaches have shown promise, they struggle to scale in more demanding scenarios where energy evaluations are expensive and the sampling space is high-dimensional. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable and sample-efficient framework that properly harmonizes the powerful classical sampling method and the diffusion sampler. Specifically, we utilize Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) samplers with a novelty-based auxiliary energy as a Searcher to collect off-policy samples, using an auxiliary energy function to compensate for exploring modes the diffusion sampler rarely visits. These off-policy samples are then combined with on-policy data to train the diffusion sampler, thereby expanding its coverage of the energy landscape. Furthermore, we identify primacy bias, i.e., the preference of samplers for early experience during training, as the main cause of mode collapse during training, and introduce a periodic re-initialization trick to resolve this issue. Our method significantly improves sample efficiency on standard benchmarks for diffusion samplers and also excels at higher-dimensional problems and real-world molecular conformer generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChemFM as a Scaling Law Guided Foundation Model Pre-trained on Informative Chemicals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21422v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for chemicals. By conducting a series of scaling experiments, we identify UniChem as the informative molecular database for pre-training the foundation model. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, as a foundation model, ChemFM exhibits strong data efficiency, requiring significantly fewer labeled training samples to achieve state-of-the-art performance. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffSpectra: Molecular Structure Elucidation from Spectra using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06853v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a fundamental challenge in molecular science. Conventional approaches rely heavily on expert interpretation and lack scalability, while retrieval-based machine learning approaches remain constrained by limited reference libraries. Generative models offer a promising alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive architectures that overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that formulates molecular structure elucidation as a conditional generation process, directly inferring 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectra using diffusion models. Its denoising network is parameterized by the Diffusion Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture for geometric modeling, conditioned by SpecFormer, a Transformer-based spectral encoder capturing multi-modal spectral dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSpectra accurately elucidates molecular structures, achieving 40.76% top-1 and 99.49% top-10 accuracy. Its performance benefits substantially from 3D geometric modeling, SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is the first framework that unifies multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow matching for reaction pathway generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10530v4)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elucidating reaction mechanisms hinges on efficiently generating transition states (TSs), products, and complete reaction networks. Recent generative models, such as diffusion models for TS sampling and sequence-based architectures for product generation, offer faster alternatives to quantum-chemistry searches. But diffusion models remain constrained by their stochastic differential equation (SDE) dynamics, which suffer from inefficiency and limited controllability. We show that flow matching, a deterministic ordinary differential (ODE) formulation, can replace SDE-based diffusion for molecular and reaction generation. We introduce MolGEN, a conditional flow-matching framework that learns an optimal transport path to transport Gaussian priors to target chemical distributions. On benchmarks used by TSDiff and OA-ReactDiff, MolGEN surpasses TS geometry accuracy and barrier-height prediction while reducing sampling to sub-second inference. MolGEN also supports open-ended product generation with competitive top-k accuracy and avoids mass/electron-balance violations common to sequence models. In a realistic test on the $\gamma$-ketohydroperoxide decomposition network, MolGEN yields higher fractions of valid and intended TSs with markedly fewer quantum-chemistry evaluations than string-based baselines. These results demonstrate that deterministic flow matching provides a unified, accurate, and computationally efficient foundation for molecular generative modeling, signaling that flow matching is the future for molecular generation across chemistry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updates from the previous version: fixed some typos of energy units.

| **[Discrete Bayesian Sample Inference for Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03015v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating graph-structured data is crucial in applications such as molecular generation, knowledge graphs, and network analysis. However, their discrete, unordered nature makes them difficult for traditional generative models, leading to the rise of discrete diffusion and flow matching models. In this work, we introduce GraphBSI, a novel one-shot graph generative model based on Bayesian Sample Inference (BSI). Instead of evolving samples directly, GraphBSI iteratively refines a belief over graphs in the continuous space of distribution parameters, naturally handling discrete structures. Further, we state BSI as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and derive a noise-controlled family of SDEs that preserves the marginal distributions via an approximation of the score function. Our theoretical analysis further reveals the connection to Bayesian Flow Networks and Diffusion models. Finally, in our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on molecular and synthetic graph generation, outperforming existing one-shot graph generative models on the standard benchmarks Moses and GuacaMol.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAR-VAE: Latent Variable Transformers for Scalable and Controllable Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02769v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development of generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable conditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and provide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE (Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder), a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are: (i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks, our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted binding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning and parameter-efficient finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Prior-Guided Flow Matching for Target-Aware Molecule Design with Learnable Atom Number](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01486v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structure-based drug design (SBDD), aiming to generate 3D molecules with high binding affinity toward target proteins, is a vital approach in novel drug discovery. Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated molecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry. Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Scalable and Cost-Efficient de Novo Template-Based Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19865v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Template-based molecular generation offers a promising avenue for drug design by ensuring generated compounds are synthetically accessible through predefined reaction templates and building blocks. In this work, we tackle three core challenges in template-based GFlowNets: (1) minimizing synthesis cost, (2) scaling to large building block libraries, and (3) effectively utilizing small fragment sets. We propose Recursive Cost Guidance, a backward policy framework that employs auxiliary machine learning models to approximate synthesis cost and viability. This guidance steers generation toward low-cost synthesis pathways, significantly enhancing cost-efficiency, molecular diversity, and quality, especially when paired with an Exploitation Penalty that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To enhance performance in smaller building block libraries, we develop a Dynamic Library mechanism that reuses intermediate high-reward states to construct full synthesis trees. Our approach establishes state-of-the-art results in template-based molecular generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy Loss Functions for Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02087v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively leveraging prior knowledge of a system's physics is crucial for applications of machine learning to scientific domains. Previous approaches mostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level. In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly into the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems like molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions also inherently respect physical symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction and report significant improvements over baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[AI-Guided Molecular Simulations in VR: Exploring Strategies for Imitation Learning in Hyperdimensional Molecular Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07189v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a crucial computational tool for researchers to understand and engineer molecular structure and function in areas such as drug discovery, protein engineering, and material design. Despite their utility, MD simulations are expensive, owing to the high dimensionality of molecular systems. Interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) has recently emerged as a "human-in-the-loop" strategy for efficiently navigating hyper-dimensional molecular systems. By providing an immersive 3D environment that enables visualization and manipulation of real-time molecular simulations running on high-performance computing architectures, iMD-VR enables researchers to reach out and guide molecular conformational dynamics, in order to efficiently explore complex, high-dimensional molecular systems. Moreover, iMD-VR simulations generate rich datasets that capture human experts' spatial insight regarding molecular structure and function. This paper explores the use of researcher-generated iMD-VR datasets to train AI agents via imitation learning (IL). IL enables agents to mimic complex behaviours from expert demonstrations, circumventing the need for explicit programming or intricate reward design. In this article, we review IL across robotics and Multi-agents systems domains which are comparable to iMD-VR, and discuss how iMD-VR recordings could be used to train IL models to interact with MD simulations. We then illustrate the applications of these ideas through a proof-of-principle study where iMD-VR data was used to train a CNN network on a simple molecular manipulation task; namely, threading a small molecule through a nanotube pore. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential challenges of using AI agents to augment human expertise in navigating vast molecular conformational spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>(Firs...</summary><p>(First presented at the First Workshop on "eXtended Reality \& Intelligent Agents" (XRIA24) @ ECAI24, Santiago De Compostela (Spain), 20 October 2024)</p></details> |
| **[One Small Step with Fingerprints, One Giant Leap for De Novo Molecule Generation from Mass Spectra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04180v4)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common approach to the de novo molecular generation problem from mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into molecular structures. In our work, we adopt MIST (Goldman et. al., 2023) as the encoder and MolForge (Ucak et. al., 2023) as the decoder, leveraging additional training data to enhance performance. We also threshold the probabilities of each fingerprint bit to focus on the presence of substructures. This results in a tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1 31% / top-10 40% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra in MassSpecGym (Bushuiev et. al., 2024). We position this as a strong baseline for future research in de novo molecule elucidation from mass spectra.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI4Mat-NeurIPS-2025 Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Generative Modeling Enables Molecular Structure Retrieval from Coulomb Explosion Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00179v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing the structural changes that molecules undergo during chemical reactions in real space and time is a long-standing dream and an essential prerequisite for understanding and ultimately controlling femtochemistry. A key approach to tackle this challenging task is Coulomb explosion imaging, which benefited decisively from recently emerging high-repetition-rate X-ray free-electron laser sources. With this technique, information on the molecular structure is inferred from the momentum distributions of the ions produced by the rapid Coulomb explosion of molecules. Retrieving molecular structures from these distributions poses a highly non-linear inverse problem that remains unsolved for molecules consisting of more than a few atoms. Here, we address this challenge using a diffusion-based Transformer neural network. We show that the network reconstructs unknown molecular geometries from ion-momentum distributions with a mean absolute error below one Bohr radius, which is half the length of a typical chemical bond.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolChord: Structure-Sequence Alignment for Protein-Guided Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27671v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structure-based drug design (SBDD), which maps target proteins to candidate molecular ligands, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Effectively aligning protein structural representations with molecular representations, and ensuring alignment between generated drugs and their pharmacological properties, remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges, we propose MolChord, which integrates two key techniques: (1) to align protein and molecule structures with their textual descriptions and sequential representations (e.g., FASTA for proteins and SMILES for molecules), we leverage NatureLM, an autoregressive model unifying text, small molecules, and proteins, as the molecule generator, alongside a diffusion-based structure encoder; and (2) to guide molecules toward desired properties, we curate a property-aware dataset by integrating preference data and refine the alignment process using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on CrossDocked2020 demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on key evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential as a practical tool for SBDD.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Graph Diffusion that can Insert and Delete](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15725v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models of graphs based on discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) offer a principled approach to molecular generation by systematically removing structural noise through iterative atom and bond adjustments. However, existing formulations are fundamentally limited by their inability to adapt the graph size (that is, the number of atoms) during the diffusion process, severely restricting their effectiveness in conditional generation scenarios such as property-driven molecular design, where the targeted property often correlates with the molecular size. In this paper, we reformulate the noising and denoising processes to support monotonic insertion and deletion of nodes. The resulting model, which we call GrIDDD, dynamically grows or shrinks the chemical graph during generation. GrIDDD matches or exceeds the performance of existing graph diffusion models on molecular property targeting despite being trained on a more difficult problem. Furthermore, when applied to molecular optimization, GrIDDD exhibits competitive performance compared to specialized optimization models. This work paves the way for size-adaptive molecular generation with graph diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025).

| **[Efficient Regression-Based Training of Normalizing Flows for Boltzmann Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01158v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-free training frameworks have been at the forefront of the generative modelling revolution in continuous spaces, leading to large-scale diffusion and flow matching models. However, such modern generative models suffer from expensive inference, inhibiting their use in numerous scientific applications like Boltzmann Generators (BGs) for molecular conformations that require fast likelihood evaluation. In this paper, we revisit classical normalizing flows in the context of BGs that offer efficient sampling and likelihoods, but whose training via maximum likelihood is often unstable and computationally challenging. We propose Regression Training of Normalizing Flows (RegFlow), a novel and scalable regression-based training objective that bypasses the numerical instability and computational challenge of conventional maximum likelihood training in favour of a simple $\ell_2$-regression objective. Specifically, RegFlow maps prior samples under our flow to targets computed using optimal transport couplings or a pre-trained continuous normalizing flow (CNF). To enhance numerical stability, RegFlow employs effective regularization strategies such as a new forward-backward self-consistency loss that enjoys painless implementation. Empirically, we demonstrate that RegFlow unlocks a broader class of architectures that were previously intractable to train for BGs with maximum likelihood. We also show RegFlow exceeds the performance, computational cost, and stability of maximum likelihood training in equilibrium sampling in Cartesian coordinates of alanine dipeptide, tripeptide, and tetrapeptide, showcasing its potential in molecular systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; ICML GenBio Best Paper Award 2025</p></details> |
| **[Omni-Mol: Multitask Molecular Model for Any-to-any Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01074v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the molecular domain, numerous studies have explored the use of multimodal large language models (LLMs) to construct a general-purpose, multi-task molecular model. However, these efforts are still far from achieving a truly universal molecular model. We identify three key challenges in this endeavor: (1) Existing molecular task datasets are typically small in scale and lack comprehensive domain coverage. (2) Tasks from different molecular subfields are difficult to effectively learn jointly through LLMs due to significant distributional shifts and competition among tasks, which introduces instability in the learning process. (3) Both inter-task and intra-task molecular representations demand different intrinsic dimensions in the language space, making it challenging to balance between redundancy and insufficiency in language model representations. To address these challenges, we innovatively categorize existing small-molecule tasks into four types: Mol2Mol, Mol2Text, Mol2Num, and Text2Mol. We then collect a dataset encompassing over 16 tasks with more than 1.4 million samples, making it the largest molecular instruction-tuning dataset to date. Leveraging the extensive pretraining of LLMs on existing chemical literature, we propose a novel multimodal LLM framework, named Omni-Mol, which unifies all small-molecule tasks and supports both molecular generation and understanding. The core of Omni-Mol is our proposed MoGE, which dynamically adapts to the intrinsic rank of different tasks. This mixture-of-experts architecture enhances the model's ability to handle diverse tasks and modalities effectively. Our model achieves unified instruction tuning across 16 tasks and attains state-of-the-art performance on 13 of them. Extensive experiments further demonstrate the scalability and versatility of Omni-Mol.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 9 figures, 13 tables, paper accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

This work presents a novel approach toward high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5% validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super explosives higher than 9 km/s predicted detonation velocity.</p></details> |  |

While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2) transformer representations refine GNN message passing through attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with 6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling, with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein representations through learnable diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[No One-Model-Fits-All: Uncovering Spatio-Temporal Forecasting Trade-offs with Graph Neural Networks and Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05179v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies.

| **[Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05636v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph learning has rapidly evolved into a critical subfield of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Its development began with early graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI, explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable, and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of graph learning.</p></details> | 185 pages |

However, most AI-driven approaches neglect the importance of endogenous protein interactions with peptides, which may result in suboptimal molecule designs. In this work, we present Peptide2Mol, an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network diffusion model that generates small molecules by referencing both the original peptide binders and their surrounding protein pocket environments. Trained on large datasets and leveraging sophisticated modeling techniques, Peptide2Mol not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in non-autoregressive generative tasks, but also produces molecules with similarity to the original peptide binder. Additionally, the model allows for molecule optimization and peptidomimetic design through a partial diffusion process. Our results highlight Peptide2Mol as an effective deep generative model for generating and optimizing bioactive small molecules from protein binding pockets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Abstr...</summary><p>Abstract 1 page, main text 9 pages, references 2 pages, 4 figures.

| **[SPECTRA: Spectral Target-Aware Graph Augmentation for Imbalanced Molecular Property Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04838v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In molecular property prediction, the most valuable compounds (e.g., high potency) often occupy sparse regions of the target space. Standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis; and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions, SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy. On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.</p></details> |  |

Analysis design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04681v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven approaches using deep learning are emerging as powerful techniques to extract non-Gaussian information from cosmological large-scale structure. This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI) pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level. Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs. Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter constraints, achieving $2-3\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\Omega_m - S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These results demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for upcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 14 figures, submitted</p></details> |

However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 18 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy</p></details> |

To address these threats, we propose WaveGuard, a proactive watermarking framework that enhances robustness and imperceptibility via frequency-domain embedding and graph-based structural consistency. Specifically, we embed watermarks into high-frequency sub-bands using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) and employ a Structural Consistency Graph Neural Network (SC-GNN) to preserve visual quality. We also design an attention module to refine embedding precision. Experimental results on face swap and reenactment tasks demonstrate that WaveGuard outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both robustness and visual quality.

| **[Causal Graph Neural Networks for Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02531v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for User Satisfaction Classification in Human-Computer Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04166v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study focuses on the problem of user satisfaction classification and proposes a framework based on graph neural networks to address the limitations of traditional methods in handling complex interaction relationships and multidimensional features. User behaviors, interface elements, and their potential connections are abstracted into a graph structure, and joint modeling of nodes and edges is used to capture semantics and dependencies in the interaction process. Graph convolution and attention mechanisms are introduced to fuse local features and global context, and global pooling with a classification layer is applied to achieve automated satisfaction classification. The method extracts deep patterns from structured data and improves adaptability and robustness in multi-source heterogeneous and dynamic environments. To verify effectiveness, a public user satisfaction survey dataset from Kaggle is used, and results are compared with multiple baseline models across several performance metrics. Experiments show that the method outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, demonstrating the advantage of graph-based modeling in satisfaction prediction tasks. The study not only enriches the theoretical framework of user modeling but also highlights its practical value in optimizing human-computer interaction experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScaleDL: Towards Scalable and Efficient Runtime Prediction for Distributed Deep Learning Workloads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04162v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) form the cornerstone of modern AI services, supporting a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving, chatbots, and recommendation systems. As models increase in size and complexity, DNN workloads like training and inference tasks impose unprecedented demands on distributed computing resources, making the accurate prediction of runtime essential for optimizing development and resource allocation. Traditional methods rely on additive computational unit models, limiting their accuracy and generalizability. In contrast, graph-enhanced modeling improves performance but significantly increases data collection costs. Therefore, there is a critical need for a method that strikes a balance between accuracy, generalizability, and the costs of data collection. To address these challenges, we propose ScaleDL, a novel runtime prediction framework that combines nonlinear layer-wise modeling with graph neural network (GNN)-based cross-layer interaction mechanism, enabling accurate DNN runtime prediction and hierarchical generalizability across different network architectures. Additionally, we employ the D-optimal method to reduce data collection costs. Experiments on the workloads of five popular DNN models prove that ScaleDL enhances runtime prediction accuracy and generalizability, achieving 6$\times$ lower MRE and 5$\times$ lower RMSE compared to baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeNoise: Learning Robust Graph Representations for Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04086v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of graph-structured data in critical domains, unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has become a pivotal task. UGAD seeks to identify entire graphs that deviate from normal behavioral patterns. However, most Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches implicitly assume that the training set is clean, containing only normal graphs, which is rarely true in practice. Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort learned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this challenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for contaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an attribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to learn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder anchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node embeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving representation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive learning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous ones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level representations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art UGAD baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plan of Knowledge: Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04072v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging factual information from Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress, benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning generalization capabilities. However, their temporal reasoning ability remains limited. LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance for reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store (TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for DG is challenging; standard fine-tuning is costly and can impair generalization. We propose GNN-MoE, enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for DG with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework using efficient Kronecker adapters. Instead of token-based routing, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) router (GCN, GAT, SAGE) operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to specialized experts. This context-aware GNN routing leverages inter-patch relationships for better adaptation to domain shifts. GNN-MoE achieves state-of-the-art or competitive DG benchmark performance with high parameter efficiency, highlighting the utility of graph-based contextual routing for robust, lightweight DG.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Local Fragments, Global Gains: Subgraph Counting using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19659v4)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph counting is a fundamental task for analyzing structural patterns in graph-structured data, with important applications in domains such as computational biology and social network analysis, where recurring motifs reveal functional and organizational properties. In this paper, we propose localized versions of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithms to improve both expressivity and computational efficiency for this task. We introduce Local $k$-WL, which we prove to be more expressive than $k$-WL and at most as expressive as $(k+1)$-WL, and provide a characterization of patterns whose subgraph and induced subgraph counts are invariant under Local $k$-WL equivalence. To enhance scalability, we present two variants -- Layer $k$-WL and Recursive $k$-WL -- that achieve greater time and space efficiency compared to applying $k$-WL on the entire graph. Additionally, we propose a novel fragmentation technique that decomposes complex subgraphs into simpler subpatterns, enabling the exact count of all induced subgraphs of size at most $4$ using only $1$-WL, with extensions possible for larger patterns when $k>1$. Building on these ideas, we develop a three-stage differentiable learning framework that combines subpattern counts to compute counts of more complex motifs, bridging combinatorial algorithm design with machine learning approaches. We also compare the expressive power of Local $k$-WL with existing GNN hierarchies and demonstrate that, under bounded time complexity, our methods are more expressive than prior approaches.</p></details> |  |

While this local message passing paradigm imparts a powerful inductive bias and exploits graph sparsity, it also yields three key challenges: (i) oversquashing of long-range information, (ii) oversmoothing of node representations, and (iii) limited expressive power. In this work we inject randomized global embeddings of node features, which we term \textit{Sketched Random Features}, into standard GNNs, enabling them to efficiently capture long-range dependencies. The embeddings are unique, distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic -- properties which we analytically and empirically show alleviate the aforementioned limitations when injected into GNNs. Experimental results on real-world graph learning tasks confirm that this strategy consistently improves performance over baseline GNNs, offering both a standalone solution and a complementary enhancement to existing techniques such as graph positional encodings.

While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2) transformer representations refine GNN message passing through attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with 6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling, with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein representations through learnable diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing the Training Dynamics of Private Fine-tuning with Langevin diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18905v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that differentially private full fine-tuning (DP-FFT) can distort pre-trained backbone features based on both theoretical and empirical results. We identify the cause of the distortion as the misalignment between the pre-trained backbone and the randomly initialized linear head. We prove that a sequential fine-tuning strategy can mitigate the feature distortion: first-linear-probing-then-fine-tuning (DP-LP-FFT). A new approximation scheme allows us to derive approximate upper and lower bounds on the training loss of DP-LP and DP-FFT, in a simple but canonical setting of 2-layer neural networks with ReLU activation. Experiments on real-world datasets and architectures are consistent with our theoretical insights. We also derive new upper bounds for 2-layer linear networks without the approximation. Moreover, our theory suggests a trade-off of privacy budget allocation in multi-phase fine-tuning methods like DP-LP-FFT.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Flow Matching KL Divergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05480v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation. In particular, if the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 > 0$, then the KL divergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$ depend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. Consequently, this bound implies statistical convergence rates of Flow Matching Transformers under the Total Variation (TV) distance. We show that, flow matching achieves nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions. Our results make the statistical efficiency of flow matching comparable to that of diffusion models under the TV distance. Numerical studies on synthetic and learned velocities corroborate our theory.</p></details> |  |

Models such as CLIP are currently widely used to bridge cross-modal representations, and text-to-image diffusion models are arguably the leading models in terms of realistic image generation. Image generative models are trained on massive datasets that provide them with powerful internal spatial representations. In this work, we explore the potential benefits of such representations, beyond image generation, in particular, for dense visual prediction tasks. We focus on the task of image segmentation, which is traditionally solved by training models on closed-vocabulary datasets, with pixel-level annotations. To avoid the annotation cost or training large diffusion models, we constraint our setup to be zero-shot and training-free. In a nutshell, our pipeline leverages different and relatively small-sized, open-source foundation models for zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation. The pipeline is as follows: the image is passed to both a captioner model (i.e. BLIP) and a diffusion model (i.e., Stable Diffusion Model) to generate a text description and visual representation, respectively. The features are clustered and binarized to obtain class agnostic masks for each object. These masks are then mapped to a textual class, using the CLIP model to support open-vocabulary. Finally, we add a refinement step that allows to obtain a more precise segmentation mask. Our approach (dubbed FreeSeg-Diff), which does not rely on any training, outperforms many training-based approaches on both Pascal VOC and COCO datasets. In addition, we show very competitive results compared to the recent weakly-supervised segmentation approaches. We provide comprehensive experiments showing the superiority of diffusion model features compared to other pretrained models. Project page: https://bcorrad.github.io/freesegdiff/</p></details> |  |

Diffusion, Flow Matching and Continuous Normalising Flows have shown effectiveness across various modalities, and rely on latent variables for generation. For experimental design or creative applications that require more control over the generation process, it has become common to manipulate the latent variable directly. However, existing approaches for performing such manipulations (e.g. interpolation or forming low-dimensional representations) only work well in special cases or are network or data-modality specific. We propose Latent Optimal Linear combinations (LOL) as a general-purpose method to form linear combinations of latent variables that adhere to the assumptions of the generative model. As LOL is easy to implement and naturally addresses the broader task of forming any linear combinations, e.g. the construction of subspaces of the latent space, LOL dramatically simplifies the creation of expressive low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |

| **[Efficient and Unbiased Sampling from Boltzmann Distributions via Variance-Tuned Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21005v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) are powerful amortized samplers for Boltzmann distributions; however, imperfect score estimates bias downstream Monte Carlo estimates. Classical importance sampling (IS) can correct this bias, but computing exact likelihoods requires solving the probability-flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE), a procedure that is prohibitively costly and scales poorly with dimensionality. We introduce Variance-Tuned Diffusion Importance Sampling (VT-DIS), a lightweight post-training method that adapts the per-step noise covariance of a pretrained SBDM by minimizing the $\alpha$-divergence ($\alpha=2$) between its forward diffusion and reverse denoising trajectories. VT-DIS assigns a single trajectory-wise importance weight to the joint forward-reverse process, yielding unbiased expectation estimates at test time with negligible overhead compared to standard sampling. On the DW-4, LJ-13, and alanine-dipeptide benchmarks, VT-DIS achieves effective sample sizes of approximately 80 %, 35 %, and 3.5 %, respectively, while using only a fraction of the computational budget required by vanilla diffusion + IS or PF-ODE-based IS.</p></details> |  |

Our 1D U-Net architecture with Feature-wise Linear Modulation learns to map desired angular scattering patterns to 2x2 dielectric sphere structure, naturally handling the non-uniqueness of inverse problems by sampling diverse valid designs. Trained on 11,000 simulated metasurfaces, the model achieves median MPE below 19% on unseen targets (best: 1.39%), outperforming CMA-ES evolutionary optimization while reducing design time from hours to seconds. These results demonstrate that employing diffusion models is promising for advancing electromagnetic inverse design research, potentially enabling rapid exploration of complex metasurface architectures and accelerating the development of next-generation photonic and wireless communication systems.

The model captures memory effects in diffusive population dynamics and serves as a framework for tumor growth modeling. We first establish local well-posedness of weak solutions. The analysis combines a Galerkin approximation with a refined a priori estimate based on a Bihari-Henry-Gronwall inequality, addressing the nonlinear coupling between the fractional diffusion and the reaction term. For small initial data, we further prove global well-posedness and asymptotic stability. A numerical method based on a nonuniform convolution quadrature scheme is then proposed and validated. Simulations demonstrate distinct dynamical behaviors compared to conventional formulations, emphasizing the physical consistency of the present model in describing tumor progression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Metrics and Diffusion Architecture for 3D Point Cloud Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05308v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions, particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new state-of-the-art.

This paper explores how machine learning methods can enhance data assimilation for GCS with a framework that integrates score-based diffusion models with machine learning-enhanced localization in channelized reservoirs during CO$_2$ injection. We employ a machine learning-enhanced localization framework that uses large ensembles ($N_s = 5000$) with permeabilities generated by the diffusion model and states computed by simple ML algorithms to improve covariance estimation for the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ESMDA). We apply ML algorithms to a prior ensemble of channelized permeability fields, generated with the geostatistical model FLUVSIM. Our approach is applied on a CO$_2$ injection scenario simulated using the Delft Advanced Research Terra Simulator (DARTS). Our ML-based localization maintains significantly more ensemble variance than when localization is not applied, while achieving comparable data-matching quality. This framework has practical implications for GCS projects, helping improve the reliability of uncertainty quantification for risk assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corresponding author: Gabriel Serr\~ao Seabra</p></details> |
| **[The Causal Round Trip: Generating Authentic Counterfactuals by Eliminating Information Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05236v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Judea Pearl's vision of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as engines for counterfactual reasoning hinges on faithful abduction: the precise inference of latent exogenous noise. For decades, operationalizing this step for complex, non-linear mechanisms has remained a significant computational challenge. The advent of diffusion models, powerful universal function approximators, offers a promising solution. However, we argue that their standard design, optimized for perceptual generation over logical inference, introduces a fundamental flaw for this classical problem: an inherent information loss we term the Structural Reconstruction Error (SRE). To address this challenge, we formalize the principle of Causal Information Conservation (CIC) as the necessary condition for faithful abduction. We then introduce BELM-MDCM, the first diffusion-based framework engineered to be causally sound by eliminating SRE by construction through an analytically invertible mechanism. To operationalize this framework, a Targeted Modeling strategy provides structural regularization, while a Hybrid Training Objective instills a strong causal inductive bias. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our Zero-SRE framework not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but, more importantly, enables the high-fidelity, individual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries. Our work provides a foundational blueprint that reconciles the power of modern generative models with the rigor of classical causal theory, establishing a new and more rigorous standard for this emerging field.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 10 figures.

However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes FUSAR-KLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into remote sensing research, constructing FUSAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT), providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships. (3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11 representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons against 14 leading foundation models, where FUSAR-KLIP demonstrates leading performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We expect that FUSAR-KLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment and provide a straightforward implementation. By theoretical analysis, our framework is feasible to achieve superior cross-domain generalization for counting. In the presented network, the features related to density are explicitly preserved across domains. Theoretically, we formalize the notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets and measuring divergences per condition. We then derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with varying density distributions. The results show that our method outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

A fundamental challenge, however, has been overlooked: annotation points are typically placed on class-representative locations (e.g., heads), forcing models to focus on class-level features while neglecting attribute information from other visual regions (e.g., legs for "walking"). To address this, we propose W2-Net, a novel framework that explicitly decouples the problem into "what to count" and "where to see" via a dual-query mechanism. Specifically, alongside the standard what-to-count (w2c) queries that localize the object, we introduce dedicated where-to-see (w2s) queries. The w2s queries are guided to seek and extract features from attribute-specific visual regions, enabling precise subclass discrimination. Furthermore, we introduce Subclass Separable Matching (SSM), a novel matching strategy that incorporates a repulsive force to enhance inter-subclass separability during label assignment. W2-Net significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the REC-8K dataset, reducing counting error by 22.5% (validation) and 18.0% (test), and improving localization F1 by 7% and 8%, respectively. Code will be available.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we present a training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with prompts compared to recent text-to-image models.

However, most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2, which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2 enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception, advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 tables, 6 figures.

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original number of inference steps, significantly improving sampling efficiency without sacrificing performance. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For compositional generation, RL-tuned SD3.5-M generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, increasing GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, greatly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

Existing methods typically rely on vision-language models like CLIP, but often exhibit limited sensitivity to text prompts. We present T2ICount, a diffusion-based framework that leverages rich prior knowledge and fine-grained visual understanding from pretrained diffusion models. While one-step denoising ensures efficiency, it leads to weakened text sensitivity. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic Correction Module that progressively refines text-image feature alignment, and a Representational Regional Coherence Loss that provides reliable supervision signals by leveraging the cross-attention maps extracted from the denosing U-Net. Furthermore, we observe that current benchmarks mainly focus on majority objects in images, potentially masking models' text sensitivity. To address this, we contribute a challenging re-annotated subset of FSC147 for better evaluation of text-guided counting ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across different benchmarks.

| **[[De|Re]constructing VLMs' Reasoning in Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19555v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial, temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames), and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement, and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving consistent improvements on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically incorporate auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However, since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics, thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios) demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy (e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark), with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.</p></details> | 24 pages, 14 figures |

This is a nontrivial extension of the TPD method [Chen et al. (2025) SIAM J. Sci. Comput.] incorporating proximal splitting techniques to address the challenges arising from the nonsmoothness of the objective function. Our key contributions include: (i) a semi-implicit-explicit iterative scheme that combines proximal gradient steps with explicit gradient steps to treat the nonsmooth and smooth terms respectively; (ii) variable-dependent preconditioners constructed from the Hessian of a regularized objective to balance iteration count and per-iteration cost; (iii) a proof of existence and uniqueness of bounded solutions for the generalized proximal operator with the chosen preconditioner, along with a convergent and bound-preserving Newton solver; and (iv) an adaptive step-size strategy to improve robustness and accelerate convergence under poor Lipschitz conditions of the energy derivative. Comprehensive numerical experiments spanning from 1D to 3D settings demonstrate that our method achieves superior computational efficiency-achieving up to a 20$\times$ speedup over existing methods-thereby highlighting its broad applicability through several challenging simulations.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

However, complex disaster scenes with diverse disaster types, geographic regions, and satellite sensors have posed new challenges for VLM applications. To fill this gap, we curate a remote sensing vision-language dataset (DisasterM3) for global-scale disaster assessment and response. DisasterM3 includes 26,988 bi-temporal satellite images and 123k instruction pairs across 5 continents, with three characteristics: 1) Multi-hazard: DisasterM3 involves 36 historical disaster events with significant impacts, which are categorized into 10 common natural and man-made disasters. 2)Multi-sensor: Extreme weather during disasters often hinders optical sensor imaging, making it necessary to combine Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for post-disaster scenes. 3) Multi-task: Based on real-world scenarios, DisasterM3 includes 9 disaster-related visual perception and reasoning tasks, harnessing the full potential of VLM's reasoning ability with progressing from disaster-bearing body recognition to structural damage assessment and object relational reasoning, culminating in the generation of long-form disaster reports. We extensively evaluated 14 generic and remote sensing VLMs on our benchmark, revealing that state-of-the-art models struggle with the disaster tasks, largely due to the lack of a disaster-specific corpus, cross-sensor gap, and damage object counting insensitivity. Focusing on these issues, we fine-tune four VLMs using our dataset and achieve stable improvements across all tasks, with robust cross-sensor and cross-disaster generalization capabilities.

Existing models often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of 73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted at ICCV Conference 2025</p></details> |

However, existing open-vocabulary and visual grounding methods rely on explicit category cues, limiting their ability to handle complex or implicit queries that require advanced reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce a new suite of tasks, including Instruction-Oriented Object Counting, Detection, and Segmentation (InstructCDS), covering open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass scenarios. We further present EarthInstruct, the first InstructCDS benchmark for earth observation. It is constructed from two diverse remote sensing datasets with varying spatial resolutions and annotation rules across 20 categories, necessitating models to interpret dataset-specific instructions. Given the scarcity of semantically rich labeled data in remote sensing, we propose InstructSAM, a training-free framework for instruction-driven object recognition. InstructSAM leverages large vision-language models to interpret user instructions and estimate object counts, employs SAM2 for mask proposal, and formulates mask-label assignment as a binary integer programming problem. By integrating semantic similarity with counting constraints, InstructSAM efficiently assigns categories to predicted masks without relying on confidence thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that InstructSAM matches or surpasses specialized baselines across multiple tasks while maintaining near-constant inference time regardless of object count, reducing output tokens by 89% and overall runtime by over 32% compared to direct generation approaches. We believe the contributions of the proposed tasks, benchmark, and effective approach will advance future research in developing versatile object recognition systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While many text-to-image models prioritize aesthetics over accessibility, it is not clear how visual illustrations relate to text simplifications (TS) generated from them. This paper presents a structured vision-language model (VLM) prompting framework for generating accessible images from simplified texts. We designed five prompt templates, i.e., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, Educational Layout, Multi-Level Detail, and Grid Layout, each following distinct spatial arrangements while adhering to accessibility constraints such as object count limits, spatial separation, and content restrictions. Using 400 sentence-level simplifications from four established TS datasets (OneStopEnglish, SimPA, Wikipedia, and ASSET), we conducted a two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assessed prompt template effectiveness with CLIPScores, and Phase 2 involved human annotation of generated images across ten visual styles by four accessibility experts. Results show that the Basic Object Focus prompt template achieved the highest semantic alignment, indicating that visual minimalism enhances language accessibility. Expert evaluation further identified Retro style as the most accessible and Wikipedia as the most effective data source. Inter-annotator agreement varied across dimensions, with Text Simplicity showing strong reliability and Image Quality proving more subjective. Overall, our framework offers practical guidelines for accessible content generation and underscores the importance of structured prompting in AI-generated visual accessibility tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Numerosity in Diffusion Models -- Limitations and Remedies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11117v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6 featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization across settings.</p></details> |  |

While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation, axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image generative models.</p></details> |  |

A persistent challenge, however, is disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational circuits.</p></details> |  |

This widespread deep-layer bias, however, is largely driven by empirical convention rather than principled analysis. While prior studies suggest that different ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, the impact of this variation on MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present the first comprehensive study of visual layer selection for MLLMs, analyzing representation similarity across ViT layers to establish shallow, middle, and deep layer groupings. Through extensive evaluation of MLLMs (1.4B-7B parameters) across 10 benchmarks encompassing 60+ tasks, we find that while deep layers excel in semantic-rich tasks like OCR, shallow and middle layers significantly outperform them on fine-grained visual tasks including counting, positioning, and object localization. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight feature fusion method that strategically incorporates shallower layers, achieving consistent improvements over both single-layer and specialized fusion baselines. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, showing that MLLMs can often see better when they look shallower.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, accepted by EMNLP2025</p></details> |

We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/VIRAL/</p></details> |

However, multi-object scenes remain challenging, as reliable control over object categories, counts, and spatial layout is difficult to achieve. For that, we first study quantity and layout consistent image editing, abbreviated as QL-Edit, which targets control of object quantity and spatial layout in multi-object scenes. Then, we present IMAGHarmony, a straightforward framework featuring a plug-and-play harmony aware (HA) module that fuses perception semantics while modeling object counts and locations, resulting in accurate edits and strong structural consistency. We further observe that diffusion models are sensitive to the choice of initial noise and tend to prefer certain noise patterns. Based on this finding, we present a preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that selects semantically aligned initial noise through vision and language matching, thereby further improving generation stability and layout consistency in multiple object editing. To support evaluation, we develop HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers a diverse range of quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGHarmony outperforms prior methods in both structural alignment and semantic accuracy, utilizing only 200 training images and 10.6M of trainable parameters.

Models such as CLIP are currently widely used to bridge cross-modal representations, and text-to-image diffusion models are arguably the leading models in terms of realistic image generation. Image generative models are trained on massive datasets that provide them with powerful internal spatial representations. In this work, we explore the potential benefits of such representations, beyond image generation, in particular, for dense visual prediction tasks. We focus on the task of image segmentation, which is traditionally solved by training models on closed-vocabulary datasets, with pixel-level annotations. To avoid the annotation cost or training large diffusion models, we constraint our setup to be zero-shot and training-free. In a nutshell, our pipeline leverages different and relatively small-sized, open-source foundation models for zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation. The pipeline is as follows: the image is passed to both a captioner model (i.e. BLIP) and a diffusion model (i.e., Stable Diffusion Model) to generate a text description and visual representation, respectively. The features are clustered and binarized to obtain class agnostic masks for each object. These masks are then mapped to a textual class, using the CLIP model to support open-vocabulary. Finally, we add a refinement step that allows to obtain a more precise segmentation mask. Our approach (dubbed FreeSeg-Diff), which does not rely on any training, outperforms many training-based approaches on both Pascal VOC and COCO datasets. In addition, we show very competitive results compared to the recent weakly-supervised segmentation approaches. We provide comprehensive experiments showing the superiority of diffusion model features compared to other pretrained models. Project page: https://bcorrad.github.io/freesegdiff/</p></details> |  |

However, we reveal that this approach can lead to weak vision-language alignment, making these models overly dependent on costly instruction-following data. To address this, we introduce ExGra-Med, a novel multi-graph alignment framework that jointly aligns images, instruction responses, and extended captions in the latent space, advancing semantic grounding and cross-modal coherence. To scale to large LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-7B), we develop an efficient end-to-end training scheme using black-box gradient estimation, enabling fast and scalable optimization. Empirically, ExGra-Med matches LLaVA-Med's performance using just 10% of the pre-training data, achieving a 20.13% gain on VQA-RAD and approaching full-data performance. It also outperforms strong baselines like BioMedGPT and RadFM on visual chatbot and zero-shot classification tasks, demonstrating its promise for efficient, high-quality vision-language integration in medical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

On the MSCOCO test set, we compare five state-of-the-art vision-and-language LLMs, decoded with greedy and nucleus sampling, to human captions. Measured with a caption-trained n-gram LM, humans display roughly twice the surprisal variance of models, but rescoring the same captions with a general-language model reverses the pattern. Our analysis introduces the surprisal-based diversity metric for image captioning. We show that relying on a single scorer can completely invert conclusions, thus, robust diversity evaluation must report surprisal under several scorers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at INLG 2025</p></details> |
| **[Caption Injection for Optimization in Generative Search Engine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04080v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Search Engines (GSEs) leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate multi-source information and provide users with accurate and comprehensive responses. Unlike traditional search engines that present results in ranked lists, GSEs shift users' attention from sequential browsing to content-driven subjective perception, driving a paradigm shift in information retrieval. In this context, enhancing the subjective visibility of content through Generative Search Engine Optimization (G-SEO) methods has emerged as a new research focus. With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) techniques, GSEs can now efficiently integrate text, images, audio, and video, producing richer responses that better satisfy complex information needs. Existing G-SEO methods, however, remain limited to text-based optimization and fail to fully exploit multimodal data. To address this gap, we propose Caption Injection, the first multimodal G-SEO approach, which extracts captions from images and injects them into textual content, integrating visual semantics to enhance the subjective visibility of content in generative search scenarios. We systematically evaluate Caption Injection on MRAMG, a benchmark for MRAG, under both unimodal and multimodal settings. Experimental results show that Caption Injection significantly outperforms text-only G-SEO baselines under the G-Eval metric, demonstrating the necessity and effectiveness of multimodal integration in G-SEO to improve user-perceived content visibility.</p></details> |  |

The RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge addresses this challenge, focusing on robust, natural language-guided cross-view image retrieval across multiple platforms (drones, satellites, and ground cameras). Current baseline methods, while effective for initial retrieval, often struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic matching between text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage retrieval refinement method: Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) that enhances the baseline coarse ranking through intelligent reranking. Our method first leverages a baseline model to obtain an initial coarse ranking of the top 20 most relevant images for each query. We then use Vision-Language-Model (VLM) to generate detailed captions for these candidate images, capturing rich semantic descriptions of their visual content. These generated captions are then used in a multimodal similarity computation framework to perform fine-grained reranking of the original text query, effectively building a semantic bridge between the visual content and natural language descriptions. Our approach significantly improves upon the baseline, achieving a consistent 5\% improvement across all key metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10). Our approach win TOP-2 in the challenge, demonstrating the practical value of our semantic refinement strategy in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly towards developing robust ML models.

| **[RxnCaption: Reformulating Reaction Diagram Parsing as Visual Prompt Guided Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02384v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP). Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector, MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will release data, models, and code on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Measuring Directional Bias Amplification in Image Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07878v4)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When we train models on biased datasets, they not only reproduce data biases, but can worsen them at test time - a phenomenon called bias amplification. Many of the current bias amplification metrics (e.g., BA (MALS), DPA) measure bias amplification only in classification datasets. These metrics are ineffective for image captioning datasets, as they cannot capture the language semantics of a caption. Recent work introduced Leakage in Captioning (LIC), a language-aware bias amplification metric that understands caption semantics. However, LIC has a crucial limitation: it cannot identify the source of bias amplification in captioning models. We propose Directional Bias Amplification in Captioning (DBAC), a language-aware and directional metric that can identify when captioning models amplify biases. DBAC has two more improvements over LIC: (1) it is less sensitive to sentence encoders (a hyperparameter in language-aware metrics), and (2) it provides a more accurate estimate of bias amplification in captions. Our experiments on gender and race attributes in the COCO captions dataset show that DBAC is the only reliable metric to measure bias amplification in captions.</p></details> |  |

In this setting, the model responds to a text query by generating an identifier corresponding to the target image. However, existing methods typically rely on manually crafted string IDs, clustering-based labels, or atomic identifiers requiring vocabulary expansion, all of which face challenges in semantic alignment or scalability.To address these limitations, we propose a vocabulary-efficient identifier generation framework that prompts MLLMs to generate Structured Semantic Identifiers from image-caption pairs. These identifiers are composed of concept-level tokens such as objects and actions, naturally aligning with the model's generation space without modifying the tokenizer. Additionally, we introduce a Rationale-Guided Supervision Strategy, prompting the model to produce a one-sentence explanation alongside each identifier serves as an auxiliary supervision signal that improves semantic grounding and reduces hallucinations during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>We pl...</summary><p>We plan to revise the methodology and update the experimental analysis before resubmission</p></details> |
| **[Natural Language Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16728v3)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article provides a brief overview of the field of Natural Language Generation. The term Natural Language Generation (NLG), in its broadest definition, refers to the study of systems that verbalize some form of information through natural language. That information could be stored in a large database or knowledge graph (in data-to-text applications), but NLG researchers may also study summarisation (text-to-text) or image captioning (image-to-text), for example. As a subfield of Natural Language Processing, NLG is closely related to other sub-disciplines such as Machine Translation (MT) and Dialog Systems. Some NLG researchers exclude MT from their definition of the field, since there is no content selection involved where the system has to determine what to say. Conversely, dialog systems do not typically fall under the header of Natural Language Generation since NLG is just one component of dialog systems (the others being Natural Language Understanding and Dialog Management). However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), different subfields of Natural Language Processing have converged on similar methodologies for the production of natural language and the evaluation of automatically generated text.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages + references.

| **[Efficient Test-Time Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01059v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities, their reliance on parametric knowledge often leads to inaccuracies. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, but these methods may introduce irrelevant retrieved documents, leading to inaccurate responses. While the integration methods filter out incorrect answers from multiple responses, but lack external knowledge like RAG methods, and their high costs require balancing overhead with performance gains. To address these issues, we propose an Efficient Test-Time Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework named ET2RAG to improve the performance of LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, ET2RAG is a training-free method, that first retrieves the most relevant documents and augments the LLMs to efficiently generate diverse candidate responses by managing response length. Then we compute the similarity of candidate responses and employ a majority voting mechanism to select the most suitable response as the final output. In particular, we discover that partial generation is sufficient to capture the key information necessary for consensus calculation, allowing us to effectively perform majority voting without the need for fully generated responses. Thus, we can reach a balance between computational cost and performance by managing the response length for the number of retrieved documents for majority voting. Experimental results demonstrate that ET2RAG significantly enhances performance across three tasks, including open-domain question answering, recipe generation and image captioning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fleming-VL: Towards Universal Medical Visual Reasoning with Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00916v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in various general-domain scenarios, such as visual question answering and image captioning. Recently, researchers have increasingly focused on empowering MLLMs with medical conversational abilities, which hold significant promise for clinical applications. However, medical data presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneous nature -- encompassing diverse modalities including 2D images, 3D volumetric scans, and temporal video sequences. The substantial domain gap and data format inconsistencies across these modalities have hindered the development of unified medical MLLMs. To address these challenges, we propose Fleming-VL, a unified end-to-end framework for comprehensive medical visual understanding across heterogeneous modalities. Fleming-VL tackles this problem from a data-centric perspective through three key strategies: (1) scaling up pretraining by integrating long-context data from both natural and medical-specific domains; (2) complementing fine-tuning with rare medical data, including holistic video analysis and underrepresented 2D modalities such as ultrasound and dermoscopy images; (3) extending existing evaluation frameworks to incorporate 3D volumetric and video understanding benchmarks. Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), we develop Fleming-VL in multiple model scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fleming-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including medical VQA, video QA, and 3D medical image understanding. We publicly release Fleming-VL to promote transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[EDITOR: Effective and Interpretable Prompt Inversion for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03067v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation models~(e.g., Stable Diffusion) have achieved significant advancements, enabling the creation of high-quality and realistic images based on textual descriptions. Prompt inversion, the task of identifying the textual prompt used to generate a specific artifact, holds significant potential for applications including data attribution, model provenance, and watermarking validation. Recent studies introduced a delayed projection scheme to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space, though challenges in semantic fluency and efficiency remain. Advanced image captioning models or visual large language models can generate highly interpretable prompts, but they often lack in image similarity. In this paper, we propose a prompt inversion technique called \sys for text-to-image diffusion models, which includes initializing embeddings using a pre-trained image captioning model, refining them through reverse-engineering in the latent space, and converting them to texts using an embedding-to-text model. Our experiments on the widely-used datasets, such as MS COCO, LAION, and Flickr, show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of image similarity, textual alignment, prompt interpretability and generalizability. We further illustrate the application of our generated prompts in tasks such as cross-concept image synthesis, concept manipulation, evolutionary multi-concept generation and unsupervised segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Hierarchical Image-Text Misalignment for Universal Fake Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00427v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of generative models, detecting generated fake images to prevent their malicious use has become a critical issue recently. Existing methods frame this challenge as a naive binary image classification task. However, such methods focus only on visual clues, yielding trained detectors susceptible to overfitting specific image patterns and incapable of generalizing to unseen models. In this paper, we address this issue from a multi-modal perspective and find that fake images cannot be properly aligned with corresponding captions compared to real images. Upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective detector termed ITEM by leveraging the image-text misalignment in a joint visual-language space as discriminative clues. Specifically, we first measure the misalignment of the images and captions in pre-trained CLIP's space, and then tune a MLP head to perform the usual detection task. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical misalignment scheme that first focuses on the whole image and then each semantic object described in the caption, which can explore both global and fine-grained local semantic misalignment as clues. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method against other state-of-the-art competitors with impressive generalization and robustness on various recent generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Accurate and Detailed Captions for High-Resolution Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27164v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels). Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models, large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused, region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work conducted in 2024; released for archival purposes</p></details> |

During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Findings).

Understanding sarcastic image-text posts often requires external contextual knowledge, such as cultural references or commonsense reasoning. However, existing models struggle to capture the deeper rationale behind sarcasm, relying mainly on shallow cues like image captions or object-attribute pairs from images. To address this, we propose \textbf{MiDRE} (\textbf{Mi}xture of \textbf{D}ual \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{E}xperts), which integrates an internal reasoning expert for detecting incongruities within the image-text pair and an external reasoning expert that utilizes structured rationales generated via Chain-of-Thought prompting to a Large Vision-Language Model. An adaptive gating mechanism dynamically weighs the two experts, selecting the most relevant reasoning path. Unlike prior methods that treat external knowledge as static input, MiDRE selectively adapts to when such knowledge is beneficial, mitigating the risks of hallucinated or irrelevant signals from large models. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MiDRE achieves superior performance over baselines. Various qualitative analyses highlight the crucial role of external rationales, revealing that even when they are occasionally noisy, they provide valuable cues that guide the model toward a better understanding of sarcasm.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often struggle with compositional reasoning - the ability to understand the relationships between concepts. A recent benchmark, SugarCrepe++, reveals that previous works on improving compositionality have mainly improved lexical sensitivity but neglected semantic understanding. In addition, downstream retrieval performance often deteriorates, although one would expect that improving compositionality should enhance retrieval. In this work, we introduce CLIC (Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP), a fine-tuning method based on a novel training technique combining multiple images and their associated captions. CLIC improves compositionality across architectures as well as differently pre-trained CLIP models, both in terms of lexical and semantic understanding, and achieves consistent gains in retrieval performance. This even applies to the recent CLIPS, which achieves SOTA retrieval performance.

Investigating multimodal in-context learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24331v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration. These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal in-context examples.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing definitions and therefore assessments of AI literacy often emphasize foundational technical knowledge, such as programming, mathematics, and statistics, over practical knowledge such as interpreting model outputs, selecting tools, or identifying ethical concerns. This leaves a noticeable gap in assessing someone's AI literacy for real-world job use. We propose a work-task-oriented assessment model for AI literacy which is grounded in the competencies required for effective use of AI tools in professional settings. We describe the development of a novel AI literacy assessment instrument, and accompanying formative assessments, in the context of a US Navy robotics training program. The program included training in robotics and AI literacy, as well as a competition with practical tasks and a multiple choice scenario task meant to simulate use of AI in a job setting. We found that, as a measure of applied AI literacy, the competition's scenario task outperformed the tests we adopted from past research or developed ourselves. We argue that when training people for AI-related work, educators should consider evaluating them with instruments that emphasize highly contextualized practical skills rather than abstract technical knowledge, especially when preparing workers without technical backgrounds for AI-integrated roles.</p></details> |  |

A prominent example is given by nematic liquid crystals, which can be modeled as nematic Korteweg fluids - that is, fluids whose stress tensor depends on density gradients and on a nematic director describing the orientation of the anisotropic molecules. These materials exhibit anisotropic acoustic properties that can be tuned by external electromagnetic fields, making them attractive for potential applications such as tunable acoustic resonators. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to this equation in two and three dimensions for suitable (nonresonant) wave numbers and propose a convergent discretisation for its numerical solution. The discretisation of this problem is nontrivial as it demands high regularity and involves unfamiliar boundary conditions; we address these challenges by using high-order conforming finite elements and enforcing the boundary conditions with Nitsche's method. We illustrate our analysis with numerical simulations in two dimensions.</p></details> |  |

The model captures memory effects in diffusive population dynamics and serves as a framework for tumor growth modeling. We first establish local well-posedness of weak solutions. The analysis combines a Galerkin approximation with a refined a priori estimate based on a Bihari-Henry-Gronwall inequality, addressing the nonlinear coupling between the fractional diffusion and the reaction term. For small initial data, we further prove global well-posedness and asymptotic stability. A numerical method based on a nonuniform convolution quadrature scheme is then proposed and validated. Simulations demonstrate distinct dynamical behaviors compared to conventional formulations, emphasizing the physical consistency of the present model in describing tumor progression.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fast and light-weight energy statistics using the \textit{R} package \textsf{estats}](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02849v8)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy statistics ($\mathcal{\varepsilon}$--statistics) enable powerful non-linear dependence measures such as distance correlation, but their computational burden has limited application to large datasets. We present memory-efficient algorithms that compute $\mathcal{\varepsilon}$--statistics related quantities by calculating pairwise distances on-the-fly rather than storing full distance matrices. Our methods achieve 5-156$\times$ speed improvements over existing implementations while reducing memory requirements from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$. These advances enable energy statistics computation with sample sizes exceeding tens of thousands observations-previously infeasible with standard implementations-facilitating their use in modern applications across statistics, bioinformatics, and machine learning where large-scale datasets are frequently met. The following cases are demonstrated: energy distance, univariate and multivariate distance variance, distance covariance, (partial) distance correlation and hypothesis testing for the equality of univariate distributions. Functions to compute the aforementioned energy statistics, among others, are available in the \textit{R} package \textsf{estats}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Efficient Adaptation and a Novel Evaluation Method for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03034v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained opinion mining approach that identifies and classifies opinions associated with specific entities (aspects) or their categories within a sentence. Despite its rapid growth and broad potential, ABSA research and resources remain concentrated in commercial domains, leaving analytical needs unmet in high-demand yet low-resource areas such as education and healthcare. Domain adaptation challenges and most existing methods' reliance on resource-intensive in-training knowledge injection further hinder progress in these areas. Moreover, traditional evaluation methods based on exact matches are overly rigid for ABSA tasks, penalising any boundary variations which may misrepresent the performance of generative models. This work addresses these gaps through three contributions: 1) We propose a novel evaluation method, Flexible Text Similarity Matching and Optimal Bipartite Pairing (FTS-OBP), which accommodates realistic extraction boundary variations while maintaining strong correlation with traditional metrics and offering fine-grained diagnostics. 2) We present the first ABSA study of small decoder-only generative language models (SLMs; <7B parameters), examining resource lower bounds via a case study in education review ABSA. We systematically explore data-free (in-context learning and weight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods, and propose a multitask fine-tuning strategy that significantly enhances SLM performance, enabling 1.5-3.8 B models to surpass proprietary large models and approach benchmark results with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU. 3) We release the first public set of education review ABSA resources to support future research in low-resource domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Face Liveness Detection for Biometric Authentication using Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02645v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biometric technologies are widely adopted in security, legal, and financial systems. Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks. Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture, we provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack detection approaches. The demo can be viewed in the following link: https://rak.box.com/s/m1uf31fn5amtjp4mkgf1huh4ykfeibaa</p></details> |  |
| **[MicroAUNet: Boundary-Enhanced Multi-scale Fusion with Knowledge Distillation for Colonoscopy Polyp Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01143v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early and accurate segmentation of colorectal polyps is critical for reducing colorectal cancer mortality, which has been extensively explored by academia and industry. However, current deep learning-based polyp segmentation models either compromise clinical decision-making by providing ambiguous polyp margins in segmentation outputs or rely on heavy architectures with high computational complexity, resulting in insufficient inference speeds for real-time colorectal endoscopic applications. To address this problem, we propose MicroAUNet, a light-weighted attention-based segmentation network that combines depthwise-separable dilated convolutions with a single-path, parameter-shared channel-spatial attention block to strengthen multi-scale boundary features. On the basis of it, a progressive two-stage knowledge-distillation scheme is introduced to transfer semantic and boundary cues from a high-capacity teacher. Extensive experiments on benchmarks also demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy under extremely low model complexity, indicating that MicroAUNet is suitable for real-time clinical polyp segmentation. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/JeremyXSC/MicroAUNet.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Split Learning-Enabled Framework for Secure and Light-weight Internet of Medical Things Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00336v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices has resulted in significant security risks, particularly the risk of malware attacks on resource-constrained devices. Conventional deep learning methods are impractical due to resource limitations, while Federated Learning (FL) suffers from high communication overhead and vulnerability to non-IID (heterogeneous) data. In this paper, we propose a split learning (SL) based framework for IoT malware detection through image-based classification. By dividing the neural network training between the clients and an edge server, the framework reduces computational burden on resource-constrained clients while ensuring data privacy. We formulate a joint optimization problem that balances computation cost and communication efficiency by using a game-theoretic approach for attaining better training performance. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed framework outperforms popular FL methods in terms of accuracy (+6.35%), F1-score (+5.03%), high convergence speed (+14.96%), and less resource consumption (33.83%). These results establish the potential of SL as a scalable and secure paradigm for next-generation IoT security.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, Under review in an IEEE Transactions journal</p></details> |
| **[Poisson Informed Retinex Network for Extreme Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04470v3)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority. In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy under ambient illumination.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures and 1 table</p></details> |
| **[MILo: Mesh-In-the-Loop Gaussian Splatting for Detailed and Efficient Surface Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24096v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds, with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior, our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics simulations or animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

By leveraging multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and transceiver designs, we engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment to emulate the operations of a CNN layer. To comprehensively evaluate AirCNN, we consider two types of CNNs, namely classic two-dimensional (2D) convolution (Conv2d) and light-weight convolution, i.e., depthwise separable convolution (ConvSD). For Conv2d realization via OTA computation, we propose and analyze two RIS-aided transmission architectures: multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO), balancing transmission overhead and emulation performance. We jointly optimize all parameters, including the transmitter precoder, receiver combiner, and RIS phase shifts, under practical constraints such as transmit power budget and unit-modulus phase shift requirements. We further extend the framework to ConvSD, which requires distinct transmission strategies for depthwise and pointwise convolutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AirCNN architectures can achieve satisfactory classification performance. Notably, Conv2d MISO consistently outperforms Conv2d MIMO across various settings, while for ConvSD, MISO is superior only under poor channel conditions. Moreover, employing multiple RISs significantly enhances performance compared to a single RIS, especially in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated wireless environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Using...</summary><p>Using wireless hardware to implement neural networks; This work is submitted to IEEE journal for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[LightBagel: A Light-weighted, Double Fusion Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22946v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and (2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn because the submission was premature and not agreed by all parties in collaboration</p></details> |
| **[Agent Data Protocol: Unifying Datasets for Diverse, Effective Fine-tuning of LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24702v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public research results on large-scale supervised finetuning of AI agents remain relatively rare, since the collection of agent training data presents unique challenges. In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves as an "interlingua" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding, software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments, we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data are released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.</p></details> |  |
| **[InstanceAssemble: Layout-Aware Image Generation via Instance Assembling Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16691v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images. Recent advancements in Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation have leveraged positional conditions and textual descriptions to facilitate precise and controllable image synthesis. Despite overall progress, current L2I methods still exhibit suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose InstanceAssemble, a novel architecture that incorporates layout conditions via instance-assembling attention, enabling position control with bounding boxes (bbox) and multimodal content control including texts and additional visual content. Our method achieves flexible adaption to existing DiT-based T2I models through light-weighted LoRA modules. Additionally, we propose a Layout-to-Image benchmark, Denselayout, a comprehensive benchmark for layout-to-image generation, containing 5k images with 90k instances in total. We further introduce Layout Grounding Score (LGS), an interpretable evaluation metric to more precisely assess the accuracy of L2I generation. Experiments demonstrate that our InstanceAssemble method achieves state-of-the-art performance under complex layout conditions, while exhibiting strong compatibility with diverse style LoRA modules. The code and pretrained models are publicly available at https://github.com/FireRedTeam/InstanceAssemble.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Approximate Light Spanners in Planar Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24825v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In their seminal paper, Alth\"{o}fer et al. (DCG 1993) introduced the {\em greedy spanner} and showed that, for any weighted planar graph $G$, the weight of the greedy $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner is at most $(1+\frac{2}{\epsilon}) \cdot w(MST(G))$, where $w(MST(G))$ is the weight of a minimum spanning tree $MST(G)$ of $G$. This bound is optimal in an {\em existential sense}: there exist planar graphs $G$ for which any $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner has a weight of at least $(1+\frac{2}{\epsilon}) \cdot w(MST(G))$. However, as an {\em approximation algorithm}, even for a {\em bicriteria} approximation, the weight approximation factor of the greedy spanner is essentially as large as the existential bound: There exist planar graphs $G$ for which the greedy $(1+x \epsilon)$-spanner (for any $1\leq x = O(\epsilon^{-1/2})$) has a weight of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\epsilon \cdot x^2})\cdot w(G_{OPT, \epsilon})$, where $G_{OPT, \epsilon}$ is a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner of $G$ of minimum weight. Despite the flurry of works over the past three decades on approximation algorithms for spanners as well as on light(-weight) spanners, there is still no (possibly bicriteria) approximation algorithm for light spanners in weighted planar graphs that outperforms the existential bound. As our main contribution, we present a polynomial time algorithm for constructing, in any weighted planar graph $G$, a $(1+\epsilon\cdot 2^{O(\log^* 1/\epsilon)})$-spanner for $G$ of total weight $O(1)\cdot w(G_{OPT, \epsilon})$. To achieve this result, we develop a new technique, which we refer to as {\em iterative planar pruning}. It iteratively modifies a spanner [...]</p></details> | <details><summary>SODA ...</summary><p>SODA 2026, abstract shortened to meet arXiv limit</p></details> |

| **[ProDER: A Continual Learning Approach for Fault Prediction in Evolving Smart Grids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05420v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As smart grids evolve to meet growing energy demands and modern operational challenges, the ability to accurately predict faults becomes increasingly critical. However, existing AI-based fault prediction models struggle to ensure reliability in evolving environments where they are required to adapt to new fault types and operational zones. In this paper, we propose a continual learning (CL) framework in the smart grid context to evolve the model together with the environment. We design four realistic evaluation scenarios grounded in class-incremental and domain-incremental learning to emulate evolving grid conditions. We further introduce Prototype-based Dark Experience Replay (ProDER), a unified replay-based approach that integrates prototype-based feature regularization, logit distillation, and a prototype-guided replay memory. ProDER achieves the best performance among tested CL techniques, with only a 0.045 accuracy drop for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone prediction. These results demonstrate the practicality of CL for scalable, real-world fault prediction in smart grids.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Consolidation of Top-Down Modulations Achieves Sparsely Supervised Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14125v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological brains learn continually from a stream of unlabeled data, while integrating specialized information from sparsely labeled examples without compromising their ability to generalize. Meanwhile, machine learning methods are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in this natural learning setting, as supervised specialist fine-tuning degrades performance on the original task. We introduce task-modulated contrastive learning (TMCL), which takes inspiration from the biophysical machinery in the neocortex, using predictive coding principles to integrate top-down information continually and without supervision. We follow the idea that these principles build a view-invariant representation space, and that this can be implemented using a contrastive loss. Then, whenever labeled samples of a new class occur, new affine modulations are learned that improve separation of the new class from all others, without affecting feedforward weights. By co-opting the view-invariance learning mechanism, we then train feedforward weights to match the unmodulated representation of a data sample to its modulated counterparts. This introduces modulation invariance into the representation space, and, by also using past modulations, stabilizes it. Our experiments show improvements in both class-incremental and transfer learning over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, as well as over comparable supervised approaches, using as few as 1% of available labels. Taken together, our work suggests that top-down modulations play a crucial role in balancing stability and plasticity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Parameterized Prompt for Incremental Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27316v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection (P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Bias of Per-sample Adam on Separable Data: Departure from the Full-batch Regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26303v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation. Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$ close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while Signum remains invariant.</p></details> | 50 pages |
| **[GraphKeeper: Graph Domain-Incremental Learning via Knowledge Disentanglement and Preservation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00097v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph incremental learning (GIL), which continuously updates graph models by sequential knowledge acquisition, has garnered significant interest recently. However, existing GIL approaches focus on task-incremental and class-incremental scenarios within a single domain. Graph domain-incremental learning (Domain-IL), aiming at updating models across multiple graph domains, has become critical with the development of graph foundation models (GFMs), but remains unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we propose Graph Domain-Incremental Learning via Knowledge Dientanglement and Preservation (GraphKeeper), to address catastrophic forgetting in Domain-IL scenario from the perspectives of embedding shifts and decision boundary deviations. Specifically, to prevent embedding shifts and confusion across incremental graph domains, we first propose the domain-specific parameter-efficient fine-tuning together with intra- and inter-domain disentanglement objectives. Consequently, to maintain a stable decision boundary, we introduce deviation-free knowledge preservation to continuously fit incremental domains. Additionally, for graphs with unobservable domains, we perform domain-aware distribution discrimination to obtain precise embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed GraphKeeper achieves state-of-the-art results with 6.5%~16.6% improvement over the runner-up with negligible forgetting. Moreover, we show GraphKeeper can be seamlessly integrated with various representative GFMs, highlighting its broad applicative potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Main Track of NeurIPS-2025</p></details> |
| **[Hyperparameters in Continual Learning: A Reality Check](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09066v5)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) aims to train a model on a sequence of tasks (i.e., a CL scenario) while balancing the trade-off between plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (retaining prior knowledge). The dominantly adopted conventional evaluation protocol for CL algorithms selects the best hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, mini-batch size, regularization strengths, etc.) within a given scenario and then evaluates the algorithms using these hyperparameters in the same scenario. However, this protocol has significant shortcomings: it overestimates the CL capacity of algorithms and relies on unrealistic hyperparameter tuning, which is not feasible for real-world applications. From the fundamental principles of evaluation in machine learning, we argue that the evaluation of CL algorithms should focus on assessing the generalizability of their CL capacity to unseen scenarios. Based on this, we propose the Generalizable Two-phase Evaluation Protocol (GTEP) consisting of hyperparameter tuning and evaluation phases. Both phases share the same scenario configuration (e.g., number of tasks) but are generated from different datasets. Hyperparameters of CL algorithms are tuned in the first phase and applied in the second phase to evaluate the algorithms. We apply this protocol to class-incremental learning, both with and without pretrained models. Across more than 8,000 experiments, our results show that most state-of-the-art algorithms fail to replicate their reported performance, highlighting that their CL capacity has been significantly overestimated in the conventional evaluation protocol. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/csm9493/GTEP.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025 camera ready version</p></details> |

Class-Continual Learning (CCL) addresses this challenge by incrementally incorporating new class knowledge without revisiting historical data, making it essential for real-world big data applications. While traditional CCL methods rely solely on visual features, recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate significant potential for CCL by leveraging pre-trained multi-modal knowledge. However, existing approaches face challenges in mitigating catastrophic forgetting while maintaining the cross-modal generalization capabilities of VLMs. To address these limitations, we propose CalFuse, a framework that synergizes feature Calibration with parameter Fusion to enable effective multi-modal knowledge integration in continual learning scenarios. CalFuse introduces a dynamic feature calibration mechanism that adaptively balances original CLIP visual representations with task-specific features, preserving the model's intrinsic cross-modal generalization while adapting to new classes. Concurrently, a QR decomposition-based parameter fusion strategy progressively integrates newly acquired knowledge with historical task parameters, maintaining equilibrium between learning new class representations and retaining prior knowledge across sequential tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in large-scale multi-modal continual learning settings, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both average accuracy and final task retention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Randomized Neural Network with Adaptive Forward Regularization for Online Task-free Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21367v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization, has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R) in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention. edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning. Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaMiT: A Time-Aware Car Model Dataset for Classification and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17626v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time (CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models, a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023), supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging, evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies: time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs. CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained visual recognition and generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in NeurIPS 2025 Track on Datasets and Benchmarks</p></details> |
| **[Class-wise Balancing Data Replay for Federated Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07712v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS'25 Accepted, Oral</p></details> |
| **[EndoCIL: A Class-Incremental Learning Framework for Endoscopic Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17200v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) for endoscopic image analysis is crucial for real-world clinical applications, where diagnostic models should continuously adapt to evolving clinical data while retaining performance on previously learned ones. However, existing replay-based CIL methods fail to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to severe domain discrepancies and class imbalance inherent in endoscopic imaging. To tackle these challenges, we propose EndoCIL, a novel and unified CIL framework specifically tailored for endoscopic image diagnosis. EndoCIL incorporates three key components: Maximum Mean Discrepancy Based Replay (MDBR), employing a distribution-aligned greedy strategy to select diverse and representative exemplars, Prior Regularized Class Balanced Loss (PRCBL), designed to alleviate both inter-phase and intra-phase class imbalance by integrating prior class distributions and balance weights into the loss function, and Calibration of Fully-Connected Gradients (CFG), which adjusts the classifier gradients to mitigate bias toward new classes. Extensive experiments conducted on four public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that EndoCIL generally outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods across varying buffer sizes and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework effectively balances stability and plasticity in lifelong endoscopic diagnosis, showing promising potential for clinical scalability and deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning After Model Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17160v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In classic supervised learning, once a model is deployed in an application, it is fixed. No updates will be made to it during the application. This is inappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples from unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be able to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after they are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model Deployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human engineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other knowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an unfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection of novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new classes are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in traditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised learning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and incrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the past data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered classes, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two challenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes often appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and incremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will demonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ECAI-2025</p></details> |
| **[The Bayesian Approach to Continual Learning: An Overview](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08922v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is an online paradigm where a learner continually accumulates knowledge from different tasks encountered over sequential time steps. Importantly, the learner is required to extend and update its knowledge without forgetting about the learning experience acquired from the past, and while avoiding the need to retrain from scratch. Given its sequential nature and its resemblance to the way humans think, continual learning offers an opportunity to address several challenges which currently stand in the way of widening the range of applicability of deep models to further real-world problems. The continual need to update the learner with data arriving sequentially strikes inherent congruence between continual learning and Bayesian inference which provides a principal platform to keep updating the prior beliefs of a model given new data, without completely forgetting the knowledge acquired from the old data. This survey inspects different settings of Bayesian continual learning, namely task-incremental learning and class-incremental learning. We begin by discussing definitions of continual learning along with its Bayesian setting, as well as the links with related fields, such as domain adaptation, transfer learning and meta-learning. Afterwards, we introduce a taxonomy offering a comprehensive categorization of algorithms belonging to the Bayesian continual learning paradigm. Meanwhile, we analyze the state-of-the-art while zooming in on some of the most prominent Bayesian continual learning algorithms to date. Furthermore, we shed some light on links between continual learning and developmental psychology, and correspondingly introduce analogies between both fields. We follow that with a discussion of current challenges, and finally conclude with potential areas for future research on Bayesian continual learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Classifier Synergy: Reward-Aligned Learning via Mutual Boosting Loop for FSCIL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03608v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation, their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[FedGTEA: Federated Class-Incremental Learning with Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12927v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning, called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings, aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting, consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modular Embedding Recomposition for Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16463v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 36th British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC 2025), Sheffield, UK</p></details> |
| **[Resource-Constrained Federated Continual Learning: What Does Matter?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08737v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Continual Learning (FCL) aims to enable sequentially privacy-preserving model training on streams of incoming data that vary in edge devices by preserving previous knowledge while adapting to new data. Current FCL literature focuses on restricted data privacy and access to previously seen data while imposing no constraints on the training overhead. This is unreasonable for FCL applications in real-world scenarios, where edge devices are primarily constrained by resources such as storage, computational budget, and label rate. We revisit this problem with a large-scale benchmark and analyze the performance of state-of-the-art FCL approaches under different resource-constrained settings. Various typical FCL techniques and six datasets in two incremental learning scenarios (Class-IL and Domain-IL) are involved in our experiments. Through extensive experiments amounting to a total of over 1,000+ GPU hours, we find that, under limited resource-constrained settings, existing FCL approaches, with no exception, fail to achieve the expected performance. Our conclusions are consistent in the sensitivity analysis. This suggests that most existing FCL methods are particularly too resource-dependent for real-world deployment. Moreover, we study the performance of typical FCL techniques with resource constraints and shed light on future research directions in FCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.11165 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[DRL: Discriminative Representation Learning with Parallel Adapters for Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12107v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs), remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference phases.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Your VAR Model is Secretly an Efficient and Explainable Generative Classifier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12060v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gains: Fine-grained Federated Domain Adaptation in Open Set](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15967v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional federated learning (FL) assumes a closed world with a fixed total number of clients. In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL process in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two critical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and integrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing research focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices source domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a fine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains). Gains splits the model into an encoder and a classifier, empirically revealing features extracted by the encoder are sensitive to domain shifts while classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. Based on this, we develop fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation techniques to identify and incorporate new knowledge. Additionally, an anti-forgetting mechanism is designed to preserve source domain performance, ensuring balanced adaptation. Experimental results on multi-domain datasets across three typical data-shift scenarios demonstrate that Gains significantly outperforms other baselines in performance for both source-domain and target-domain clients.
