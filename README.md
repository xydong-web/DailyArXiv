| **[Ultrafast topological data analysis reveals pandemic-scale dynamics of convergent evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07292v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genome variants which re-occur independently across evolutionary lineages are key molecular signatures of adaptation. Inferring the dynamics of such genetic changes from pandemic-scale genomic datasets is now possible, which opens up unprecedented insight into evolutionary processes. However, existing approaches depend on the construction of accurate phylogenetic trees, which remains challenging at scale. Here we present EVOtRec, an organism-agnostic, fast and scalable Topological Data Analysis approach that enables the inference of convergently evolving genomic variants over time directly from topological patterns in the dataset, without requiring the construction of a phylogenetic tree. Using data from both simulations and published experiments, we show that EVOtRec can robustly identify variants under positive selection and performs orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art phylogeny-based approaches, with comparable results. We apply EVOtRec to three large viral genome datasets: SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus A subtype H5N1 and HIV-1. We identify key convergent genome variants and demonstrate how EVOtRec facilitates the real-time tracking of high fitness variants in large datasets with millions of genomes, including effects modulated by varying genomic backgrounds. We envision our Topological Data Analysis approach as a new framework for efficient comparative genomics.</p></details> | substantial revision |
| **[3D Molecule Generation from Rigid Motifs via SE(3) Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16955v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional molecular structure generation is typically performed at the level of individual atoms, yet molecular graph generation techniques often consider fragments as their structural units. Building on the advances in frame-based protein structure generation, we extend these fragmentation ideas to 3D, treating general molecules as sets of rigid-body motifs. Utilising this representation, we employ SE(3)-equivariant generative modelling for de novo 3D molecule generation from rigid motifs. In our evaluations, we observe comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art across benchmarks, surpassing it in atom stability on GEOM-Drugs, while yielding a 2x to 10x reduction in generation steps and offering 3.5x compression in molecular representations compared to the standard atom-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProveRAG: Provenance-Driven Vulnerability Analysis with Automated Retrieval-Augmented LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17406v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cybersecurity, security analysts constantly face the challenge of mitigating newly discovered vulnerabilities in real-time, with over 300,000 vulnerabilities identified since 1999. The sheer volume of known vulnerabilities complicates the detection of patterns for unknown threats. While LLMs can assist, they often hallucinate and lack alignment with recent threats. Over 40,000 vulnerabilities have been identified in 2024 alone, which are introduced after most popular LLMs' (e.g., GPT-5) training data cutoff. This raises a major challenge of leveraging LLMs in cybersecurity, where accuracy and up-to-date information are paramount. Therefore, we aim to improve the adaptation of LLMs in vulnerability analysis by mimicking how an analyst performs such tasks. We propose ProveRAG, an LLM-powered system designed to assist in rapidly analyzing vulnerabilities with automated retrieval augmentation of web data while self-evaluating its responses with verifiable evidence. ProveRAG incorporates a self-critique mechanism to help alleviate the omission and hallucination common in the output of LLMs applied in cybersecurity applications. The system cross-references data from verifiable sources (NVD and CWE), giving analysts confidence in the actionable insights provided. Our results indicate that ProveRAG excels in delivering verifiable evidence to the user with over 99% and 97% accuracy in exploitation and mitigation strategies, respectively. ProveRAG guides analysts to secure their systems more effectively by overcoming temporal and context-window limitations while also documenting the process for future audits.</p></details> |  |

The task of AfriEconQA is to answer complex economic queries that require high-precision numerical reasoning and temporal disambiguation from specialized institutional documents. The dataset consists of 8,937 curated QA instances, rigorously filtered from a pool of 10018 synthetic questions to ensure high-quality evidence-answer alignment. Each instance is composed of: (1) a question requiring reasoning over economic indicators, (2) the corresponding evidence retrieved from the corpus, (3) a verified ground-truth answer, and (4) source metadata (e.g., URL and publication date) to ensure temporal provenance. AfriEconQA is the first benchmark focused specifically on African economic analysis, providing a unique challenge for Information Retrieval (IR) systems, as the data is largely absent from the pretraining corpora of current Large Language Models (LLMs). We operationalize this dataset through an 11-experiment matrix, benchmarking a zero-shot baseline (GPT-5 Mini) against RAG configurations using GPT-4o and Qwen 32B across five distinct embedding and ranking strategies. Our results demonstrate a severe parametric knowledge gap, where zero-shot models fail to answer over 90 percent of queries, and even state-of-the-art RAG pipelines struggle to achieve high precision. This confirms AfriEconQA as a robust and challenging benchmark for the next generation of domain-specific IR and RAG systems. The AfriEconQA dataset and code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Reliable Subset Reduction (RSR), a reliability-driven preprocessing framework that leverages belief propagation (BP) statistics to identify and remove highly reliable qubits, substantially reducing the effective problem size. Additionally, we identify a degeneracy condition that allows high-order OSD to be simplified to order-0 OSD. By integrating these techniques, we present an ADOSD algorithm that significantly improves OSD efficiency. Our BP+RSR+ADOSD framework extends naturally to circuit-level noise and can handle large-scale codes with more than $10^4$ error variables. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate improved performance over MWPM and Localized Statistics Decoding for a variety of CSS and non-CSS codes under the code-capacity noise model, and for rotated surface codes under realistic circuit-level noise. At low physical error rates, RSR reduces the effective problem size to less than 5\%, enabling higher-order OSD with accelerated runtime. These results highlight the practical efficiency and broad applicability of the BP+ADOSD framework for both theoretical and realistic quantum error correction scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages.

| **[AnyView: Synthesizing Any Novel View in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16982v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern generative video models excel at producing convincing, high-quality outputs, but struggle to maintain multi-view and spatiotemporal consistency in highly dynamic real-world environments. In this work, we introduce \textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \emph{any} viewpoint. Results, data, code, and models can be viewed at: https://tri-ml.github.io/AnyView/</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://tri-ml.github.io/AnyView/</p></details> |
| **[SyncLight: Controllable and Consistent Multi-View Relighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16981v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SyncLight, the first method to enable consistent, parametric relighting across multiple uncalibrated views of a static scene. While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information. SyncLight enables practical relighting workflows for multi-view capture systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: http://sync-light.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Latent Diffusion for Internet of Things Attack Data Generation in Intrusion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16976v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a key component for protecting Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE. 15 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16971v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for language modeling, yet they face a performance gap compared to autoregressive models (ARMs) and require more training iterations. In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence. Empirical results demonstrate that ARMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard language modeling benchmarks, outperforming established diffusion baselines while requiring significantly fewer training steps. Furthermore, it establishes a new benchmark for parallel text generation, effectively bridging the performance gap between parallel and sequential decoding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-learning with Adjoint Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14234v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Q-learning with Adjoint Matching (QAM), a novel TD-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that tackles a long-standing challenge in continuous-action RL: efficient optimization of an expressive diffusion or flow-matching policy with respect to a parameterized Q-function. Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Provable Differentially Private Computation of the Cross-Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14717v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-attention has emerged as a cornerstone module in modern artificial intelligence, underpinning critical applications such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), system prompting, and guided stable diffusion. However, this is a rising concern about securing the privacy of cross-attention, as the underlying key and value matrices frequently encode sensitive data or private user information. In this work, we introduce a novel data structure designed to enforce differential privacy (DP) for cross-attention mechanisms, accompanied by provable theoretical guarantees. Specifically, letting $n$ denote the input sequence length, $d$ the feature dimension, $R$ the maximum magnitude of query and key matrices, $R_w$ the maximum magnitude of the value matrix, and $r, s, ε_s$ the parameters for polynomial kernel methods, our proposed structure achieves $\widetilde{O}(ndr^2)$ space and initialization complexity, with a query time of $\widetilde{O}(d r^2)$ per token. Moreover, we demonstrate that our mechanism satisfies $(ε, δ)$-DP, incurring an additive error of $\widetilde{O}((1-ε_s)^{-1} n^{-1} ε^{-1} R^{2s} R_w r^2)$ and a relative error of $2ε_s/(1-ε_s)$ with respect to the ground truth. Crucially, our framework maintains robustness against adaptive queries, ensuring security even in adversarial settings. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first approach providing provable differential privacy for cross-attention, establishing a foundation for future privacy-preserving algorithms in large generative models (LGMs).</p></details> |  |

We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (+7 appendix), 7 figures.

This paper tackles the challenging yet most impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image, as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. We show that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones, necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments on SD-XL and FLUX-1.dev show that T-LoRA and its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model personalization techniques, achieving a superior balance between concept fidelity and text alignment.

The task of AfriEconQA is to answer complex economic queries that require high-precision numerical reasoning and temporal disambiguation from specialized institutional documents. The dataset consists of 8,937 curated QA instances, rigorously filtered from a pool of 10018 synthetic questions to ensure high-quality evidence-answer alignment. Each instance is composed of: (1) a question requiring reasoning over economic indicators, (2) the corresponding evidence retrieved from the corpus, (3) a verified ground-truth answer, and (4) source metadata (e.g., URL and publication date) to ensure temporal provenance. AfriEconQA is the first benchmark focused specifically on African economic analysis, providing a unique challenge for Information Retrieval (IR) systems, as the data is largely absent from the pretraining corpora of current Large Language Models (LLMs). We operationalize this dataset through an 11-experiment matrix, benchmarking a zero-shot baseline (GPT-5 Mini) against RAG configurations using GPT-4o and Qwen 32B across five distinct embedding and ranking strategies. Our results demonstrate a severe parametric knowledge gap, where zero-shot models fail to answer over 90 percent of queries, and even state-of-the-art RAG pipelines struggle to achieve high precision. This confirms AfriEconQA as a robust and challenging benchmark for the next generation of domain-specific IR and RAG systems. The AfriEconQA dataset and code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Reliable Subset Reduction (RSR), a reliability-driven preprocessing framework that leverages belief propagation (BP) statistics to identify and remove highly reliable qubits, substantially reducing the effective problem size. Additionally, we identify a degeneracy condition that allows high-order OSD to be simplified to order-0 OSD. By integrating these techniques, we present an ADOSD algorithm that significantly improves OSD efficiency. Our BP+RSR+ADOSD framework extends naturally to circuit-level noise and can handle large-scale codes with more than $10^4$ error variables. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate improved performance over MWPM and Localized Statistics Decoding for a variety of CSS and non-CSS codes under the code-capacity noise model, and for rotated surface codes under realistic circuit-level noise. At low physical error rates, RSR reduces the effective problem size to less than 5\%, enabling higher-order OSD with accelerated runtime. These results highlight the practical efficiency and broad applicability of the BP+ADOSD framework for both theoretical and realistic quantum error correction scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages.

The sheer volume of known vulnerabilities complicates the detection of patterns for unknown threats. While LLMs can assist, they often hallucinate and lack alignment with recent threats. Over 40,000 vulnerabilities have been identified in 2024 alone, which are introduced after most popular LLMs' (e.g., GPT-5) training data cutoff. This raises a major challenge of leveraging LLMs in cybersecurity, where accuracy and up-to-date information are paramount. Therefore, we aim to improve the adaptation of LLMs in vulnerability analysis by mimicking how an analyst performs such tasks. We propose ProveRAG, an LLM-powered system designed to assist in rapidly analyzing vulnerabilities with automated retrieval augmentation of web data while self-evaluating its responses with verifiable evidence. ProveRAG incorporates a self-critique mechanism to help alleviate the omission and hallucination common in the output of LLMs applied in cybersecurity applications. The system cross-references data from verifiable sources (NVD and CWE), giving analysts confidence in the actionable insights provided. Our results indicate that ProveRAG excels in delivering verifiable evidence to the user with over 99% and 97% accuracy in exploitation and mitigation strategies, respectively.
