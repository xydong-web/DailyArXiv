We investigate whether this focus on calculation creates a "tunnel vision" that ignores safety in critical situations. We introduce MortalMATH, a benchmark of 150 scenarios where users request algebra help while describing increasingly life-threatening emergencies (e.g., stroke symptoms, freefall). We find a sharp behavioral split: generalist models (like Llama-3.1) successfully refuse the math to address the danger. In contrast, specialized reasoning models (like Qwen-3-32b and GPT-5-nano) often ignore the emergency entirely, maintaining over 95 percent task completion rates while the user describes dying. Furthermore, the computational time required for reasoning introduces dangerous delays: up to 15 seconds before any potential help is offered. These results suggest that training models to relentlessly pursue correct answers may inadvertently unlearn the survival instincts required for safe deployment.</p></details> |  |

We extract 64 features across six families and fit statistical regression models to compare PR merge outcomes for human and agentic PRs, as well as across three AI agents.

| **[Conditioned Generative Modeling of Molecular Glues: A Realistic AI Approach for Synthesizable Drug-like Molecules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18716v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by the pathological accumulation of amyloid beta-42 (Abeta-42), contributing to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. While extracellular amyloid plaques are well-studied, increasing evidence highlights intracellular Abeta-42 as an early and toxic driver of disease progression. In this study, we present a novel, AI-assisted drug design approach to promote targeted degradation of Abeta-42 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), using E3 ligase-directed molecular glues. We systematically evaluated the ternary complex formation potential of Abeta-42 with three E3 ligases: CRBN, VHL, and MDM2, through structure-based modeling, ADMET screening, and docking. We then developed a Ligase-Conditioned Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (LC-JT-VAE) to generate ligase-specific small molecules, incorporating protein sequence embeddings and torsional angle-aware molecular graphs. Our results demonstrate that this generative model can produce chemically valid, novel, and target-specific molecular glues capable of facilitating Abeta-42 degradation. This integrated approach offers a promising framework for designing UPS-targeted therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |

We evaluate Equilibrium Propagation (EP), an energy-based learning method that does not use backpropagation (incompatible with quantum systems due to state-collapsing measurements) and Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for automated detection of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) from blood cell microscopy images using binary classification (2 classes: AML vs. Healthy). Key Result: Using limited subsets (50-250 samples per class) of the AML-Cytomorphology dataset (18,365 expert-annotated images), quantum methods achieve performance only 12-15% below classical CNNs despite reduced image resolution (64x64 pixels), engineered features (20D), and classical simulation via Qiskit. EP reaches 86.4% accuracy (only 12% below CNN) without backpropagation, while the 4-qubit VQC attains 83.0% accuracy with consistent data efficiency: VQC maintains stable 83% performance with only 50 samples per class, whereas CNN requires 250 samples (5x more data) to reach 98%. These results establish reproducible baselines for QML in healthcare, validating NISQ-era feasibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |

Recent feature caching methods accelerate inference via temporal extrapolation, yet can suffer quality degradation from inaccurate modeling of the complex dynamics of feature evolution. We propose HiCache (Hermite Polynomial-based Feature Cache), a training-free acceleration framework that improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature-derivative approximations in diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials as a potentially optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. We further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability while preserving predictive accuracy, and is also effective when applied standalone or integrated with TaylorSeer. Extensive experiments demonstrate HiCache's superiority, achieving 5.55x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while matching or exceeding baseline quality, and maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video generation, and super-resolution tasks. Moreover, HiCache can be naturally added to previous caching methods to enhance their performance, e.g., improving ClusCa from 0.9480 to 0.9840 in terms of image rewards.

However, existing approaches necessitate to either introduce an off-the-shelf external representation task or rely on a large-scale, pre-trained external representation encoder to provide representation guidance during the training process. In this study, we posit that the unique discriminative process inherent to diffusion transformers enables them to offer such guidance without requiring external representation components. We propose SelfRepresentation Alignment (SRA), a simple yet effective method that obtains representation guidance using the internal representations of learned diffusion transformer. SRA aligns the latent representation of the diffusion transformer in the earlier layer conditioned on higher noise to that in the later layer conditioned on lower noise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning during only the training process. Experimental results indicate that applying SRA to DiTs and SiTs yields consistent performance improvements, and largely outperforms approaches relying on auxiliary representation task. Our approach achieves performance comparable to methods that are dependent on an external pre-trained representation encoder, which demonstrates the feasibility of acceleration with representation alignment in diffusion transformers themselves.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026.

However, methods for interpreting, exploring and reversing embedding spaces are limited, reducing transparency and precluding potentially valuable generative use cases. In this work, we align Large Language Models to embeddings of clinical trials using the recently reported Embedding Language Model (ELM) method. We develop an open-source, domain-agnostic ELM architecture and training framework, design training tasks for clinical trials, and introduce an expert-validated synthetic dataset. We then train a series of ELMs exploring the impact of tasks and training regimes. Our final model, ctELM, can accurately describe and compare unseen clinical trials from embeddings alone and produce plausible clinical trials from novel vectors. We further show that generated trial abstracts are responsive to moving embeddings along concept vectors for age and sex of study subjects. Our public ELM implementation and experimental results will aid the alignment of Large Language Models to embedding spaces in the biomedical domain and beyond.</p></details> |  |

One example is scope extrusion: the generation of ill-scoped code. Scope extrusion can either be preemptively prevented, via static type systems, or retroactively detected, via dynamic checks. Static type systems exist in theory, but struggle with a range of implementation and usability problems in practice. In contrast, dynamic checks exist in practice (e.g. in MetaOCaml), but are understudied in theory. Designers of metalanguages are thus given little guidance regarding the design and implementation of checks. We present the first formal study of dynamic scope extrusion checks, introducing a calculus ($λ_{\langle\langle\text{op}\rangle\rangle}$) for describing and evaluating checks. Further, we introduce a novel dynamic check $\unicode{x2014}$ the "Cause-for-Concern" check $\unicode{x2014}$ which we prove correct, characterise without reference to its implementation, and argue combines the advantages of existing dynamic checks. Finally, we extend our framework with refined environment classifiers, which statically prevent scope extrusion, and compare their expressivity with the dynamic checks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of Handling Scope Checks (POPL'26): includes appendices, fixes minor typos, and tweaks phrasing for readability</p></details> |

| **[From Access Control to Usage Control with User-Managed Access](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18761v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent data protection and data governance regulations have intensified the demand for interoperable, decentralized data ecosystems that can support not only access control but also legally-aligned governance over data use. Existing Web-based data storage platforms increasingly struggle to meet these regulatory and practical requirements, as their authorization mechanisms rely on tightly coupled, document-centric access control models that lack expressiveness for legal constraints and fail to separate data management from authorization concerns. In parallel, widely adopted authorization standards remain poorly aligned with decentralized, semantically rich usage-control scenarios. To bridge this gap, this work introduces an architecture that replaces Solid's native access control mechanisms with a UMA authorization flow, enabling the enforcement of usage control policies expressed with the W3C ODRL standard. This article details the conceptual background motivating this approach, presents the proposed UMA-based architecture, and describes a prototype implementation that integrates an ODRL-enabled Authorization Server with a Solid-compatible Resource Server. The prototype demonstrates that decoupling authorization from storage enables more flexible, interoperable, and legally expressive control over data use, while remaining compatible with existing Solid infrastructure. It also highlights practical design choices required to evaluate ODRL policies in the absence of a fully standardized evaluation semantics. Moreover, this work shows how usage control can be operationalized using existing Web standards, offering a concrete path beyond permission-based access control toward policy-aware, legally informed data governance. Future research will focus on policy management interfaces, richer claim verification mechanisms, and techniques for communicating and enforcing obligations over time.</p></details> |  |

We investigate whether this focus on calculation creates a "tunnel vision" that ignores safety in critical situations. We introduce MortalMATH, a benchmark of 150 scenarios where users request algebra help while describing increasingly life-threatening emergencies (e.g., stroke symptoms, freefall). We find a sharp behavioral split: generalist models (like Llama-3.1) successfully refuse the math to address the danger. In contrast, specialized reasoning models (like Qwen-3-32b and GPT-5-nano) often ignore the emergency entirely, maintaining over 95 percent task completion rates while the user describes dying. Furthermore, the computational time required for reasoning introduces dangerous delays: up to 15 seconds before any potential help is offered. These results suggest that training models to relentlessly pursue correct answers may inadvertently unlearn the survival instincts required for safe deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Blown Lead Paradox: Conditional Laws for the Running Maximum of Binary Doob Martingales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18774v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Live win-probability forecasts are now ubiquitous in sports broadcasts, and retrospective commentary often cites the largest win probability attained by a team that ultimately loses as evidence of a "collapse." Interpreting such extrema requires a reference distribution under correct specification. Modeling the forecast sequence as the Doob martingale of conditional win probabilities for a binary terminal outcome, we derive sharp distributional laws for its path maximum, including the conditional law given an eventual loss. In discrete time, we quantify explicit correction terms (last-step crossings and overshoots); under continuous-path regularity these corrections disappear, yielding exact identities. We further obtain closed-form distributions for two extensions: the maximal win probability attained by the eventual loser in a two-player game and the minimal win probability attained by the eventual winner in an n-player game. The resulting formulas furnish practical benchmarks for diagnosing sequential forecast calibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Stochastic Processes and their Applications. 22 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Let's Make Every Pull Request Meaningful: An Empirical Analysis of Developer and Agentic Pull Requests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18749v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic generation of pull requests (PRs) using AI agents has become increasingly common. Although AI-generated PRs are fast and easy to create, their merge rates have been reported to be lower than those created by humans. In this study, we conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of 40,214 PRs collected from the AIDev dataset. We extract 64 features across six families and fit statistical regression models to compare PR merge outcomes for human and agentic PRs, as well as across three AI agents. Our results show that submitter attributes dominate merge outcomes for both groups, while review-related features exhibit contrasting effects between human and agentic PRs. The findings of this study provide insights into improving PR quality through human-AI collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 23rd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR '26) : 5 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[TensLoRA: Tensor Alternatives for Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19391v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently adapt Transformers by adding trainable low-rank matrices to attention projections. While effective, these matrices are considered independent for each attention projection (Query, Key, and Value) and each layer. Recent extensions have considered joint, tensor-based adaptations, but only in limited forms and without a systematic framework. We introduce TensLoRA, a unified framework that aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of tensor-based low-rank adaptations. Our formulation generalizes existing tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates, allowing parameter budgets to be tailored according to the modality and task. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks reveal that the tensor construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA under similar parameter counts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICASSP 2026. 5 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables.

| **[Analyzing Images of Blood Cells with Quantum Machine Learning Methods: Equilibrium Propagation and Variational Quantum Circuits to Detect Acute Myeloid Leukemia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18710v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a feasibility study demonstrating that quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms achieve competitive performance on real-world medical imaging despite operating under severe constraints. We evaluate Equilibrium Propagation (EP), an energy-based learning method that does not use backpropagation (incompatible with quantum systems due to state-collapsing measurements) and Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for automated detection of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) from blood cell microscopy images using binary classification (2 classes: AML vs. Healthy). Key Result: Using limited subsets (50-250 samples per class) of the AML-Cytomorphology dataset (18,365 expert-annotated images), quantum methods achieve performance only 12-15% below classical CNNs despite reduced image resolution (64x64 pixels), engineered features (20D), and classical simulation via Qiskit. EP reaches 86.4% accuracy (only 12% below CNN) without backpropagation, while the 4-qubit VQC attains 83.0% accuracy with consistent data efficiency: VQC maintains stable 83% performance with only 50 samples per class, whereas CNN requires 250 samples (5x more data) to reach 98%. These results establish reproducible baselines for QML in healthcare, validating NISQ-era feasibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |
