| **[Artificial Intelligence in Spanish Gastroenterology: high expectations, limited integration. A national survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17011v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a disruptive innovation in medicine, yet its adoption within gastroenterology remains limited and poorly characterized. We aimed to examine knowledge, practical applications, perceived barriers, and expectations regarding AI among gastroenterology specialists in Spain. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using a structured online survey distributed by the Spanish Society of Digestive Pathology (SEPD) in 2025. The questionnaire collected sociodemographic data, patterns of AI use, perceptions, and educational needs. Descriptive statistics and multivariable models were applied. Results: Among 283 respondents (mean age 44.6 +/- 9.7 years), 87.5% acknowledged AI as a transformative tool, but only 60.2% (95% CI: 54.3-66.1%) reported using it, mostly outside institutional frameworks. Notably, 80.2% of users initiated AI use within the past year. Independent predictors of frequent use included previous training (OR=2.44), employment in university hospitals (OR=2.14), and younger age (OR=1.36 per 5-year decrease). Main barriers were lack of training (61%), absence of institutional strategies (46%), and ethical concerns (50%). While 93.8% agreed that AI training programmes are necessary, only 18.4% had received formal training. Conclusions: A substantial gap exists between the favorable perception of AI and its actual integration into clinical practice within Spanish gastroenterology. The rapid adoption outside institutional frameworks underscores the urgent need for accredited training programmes and governance standards led by scientific societies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Two-Scale Rank Distributions via Redistribution Dynamics or an Analytic Derivation of the Beta Rank Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19859v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Beta Rank Function (BRF) is a two-sided distribution characterized by a smooth peak and double powerlaw decay, widely used to model empirical data exhibiting deviations from pure power laws. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-step generative process that produces data exactly following the BRF distribution. The first step involves any mechanism generating a power-law distribution, while the second step applies a regressive redistribution process that reallocates resources from poorer to richer entities, thereby amplifying inequality. This approach represents the first analytic derivation of an exact BRF distribution from a generative mechanism. We validate the model through applications to income and urban population distributions. Beyond exact generation, this framework offers new insights into the systemic origins of deviations from power laws frequently observed in complex systems, linking rank distributions to underlying feedback and redistribution dynamics.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

However, its adoption for bimanual tasks is an underexplored problem due to the complexity of hand coordination, which also hinders data recording. This paper presents a novel one-shot method for processing a single RGB video of a bimanual task demonstration to generate an execution plan for a dual-arm robotic system. To detect hand coordination policies, we apply Shannon's information theory to analyze the information flow between scene elements and leverage scene graph properties. The generated plan is a modular behavior tree that assumes different structures based on the desired arms coordination. We validated the effectiveness of this framework through multiple subject video demonstrations, which we collected and made open-source, and exploiting data from an external, publicly available dataset. Comparisons with existing methods revealed significant improvements in generating a centralized execution plan for coordinating two-arm systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Effect of Architecture During Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19766v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is a challenge for models with static architecture, as they fail to adapt to when data distributions evolve across tasks. We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting. To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions. Empirical studies across regression and classification problems, including feedforward, convolutional, and graph neural networks, demonstrate that learning the optimal architecture and weights simultaneously yields substantially improved performance (up to two orders of magnitude), reduced forgetting, and enhanced robustness to noise compared with static architecture approaches.</p></details> |  |

| **[Parameter-Efficient MoE LoRA for Few-Shot Multi-Style Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11236v3)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/cao-cong/FSMSE.</p></details> | Technical report |

| **[Generative Latent Alignment for Interpretable Radar Based Occupancy Detection in Ambient Assisted Living](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19853v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study how to make mmWave radar presence detection more interpretable for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) settings, where camera-based sensing raises privacy concerns. We propose a Generative Latent Alignment (GLA) framework that combines a lightweight convolutional variational autoencoder with a frozen CLIP text encoder to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of radar Range-Angle (RA) heatmaps. The latent space is softly aligned with two semantic anchors corresponding to "empty room" and "person present", and Grad-CAM is applied in this aligned latent space to visualize which spatial regions support each presence decision. On our mmWave radar dataset, we qualitatively observe that the "person present" class produces compact Grad-CAM blobs that coincide with strong RA returns, whereas "empty room" samples yield diffuse or no evidence. We also conduct an ablation study using unrelated text prompts, which degrades both reconstruction and localization, suggesting that radar-specific anchors are important for meaningful explanations in this setting.</p></details> |  |

| **[Diffusion for De-Occlusion: Accessory-Aware Diffusion Inpainting for Robust Ear Biometric Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19795v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ear occlusions (arising from the presence of ear accessories such as earrings and earphones) can negatively impact performance in ear-based biometric recognition systems, especially in unconstrained imaging circumstances. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a diffusion-based ear inpainting technique as a pre-processing aid to mitigate the issues of ear accessory occlusions in transformer-based ear recognition systems. Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule. We evaluate the effectiveness of this pre-processing aid in transformer-based recognition systems for several vision transformer models and different patch sizes for a range of benchmark datasets. Experiments show that diffusion-based inpainting can be a useful pre-processing aid to alleviate ear accessory occlusions to improve overall recognition performance.</p></details> |  |

This approach represents the first analytic derivation of an exact BRF distribution from a generative mechanism. We validate the model through applications to income and urban population distributions. Beyond exact generation, this framework offers new insights into the systemic origins of deviations from power laws frequently observed in complex systems, linking rank distributions to underlying feedback and redistribution dynamics.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

However, its adoption for bimanual tasks is an underexplored problem due to the complexity of hand coordination, which also hinders data recording. This paper presents a novel one-shot method for processing a single RGB video of a bimanual task demonstration to generate an execution plan for a dual-arm robotic system. To detect hand coordination policies, we apply Shannon's information theory to analyze the information flow between scene elements and leverage scene graph properties. The generated plan is a modular behavior tree that assumes different structures based on the desired arms coordination. We validated the effectiveness of this framework through multiple subject video demonstrations, which we collected and made open-source, and exploiting data from an external, publicly available dataset. Comparisons with existing methods revealed significant improvements in generating a centralized execution plan for coordinating two-arm systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReVision: A Dataset and Baseline VLM for Privacy-Preserving Task-Oriented Visual Instruction Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14780v3)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient and privacy-preserving multimodal interaction is essential as AR, VR, and modern smartphones with powerful cameras become primary interfaces for human-computer communication. Existing powerful large vision-language models (VLMs) enabling multimodal interaction often rely on cloud-based processing, raising significant concerns about (1) visual privacy by transmitting sensitive vision data to servers, and (2) their limited real-time, on-device usability. This paper explores Visual Instruction Rewriting, a novel approach that transforms multimodal instructions into text-only commands, allowing seamless integration of lightweight on-device instruction rewriter VLMs (250M parameters) with existing conversational AI systems, enhancing vision data privacy. To achieve this, we present a dataset of over 39,000 examples across 14 domains and develop a compact VLM, pretrained on image captioning datasets and fine-tuned for instruction rewriting. Experimental results, evaluated through NLG metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE, along with semantic parsing analysis, demonstrate that even a quantized version of the model (<500MB storage footprint) can achieve effective instruction rewriting, thus enabling privacy-focused, multimodal AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the IJCNLP-AACL 2025</p></details> |

| **[Artificial Intelligence in Spanish Gastroenterology: high expectations, limited integration. A national survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17011v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a disruptive innovation in medicine, yet its adoption within gastroenterology remains limited and poorly characterized. We aimed to examine knowledge, practical applications, perceived barriers, and expectations regarding AI among gastroenterology specialists in Spain. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using a structured online survey distributed by the Spanish Society of Digestive Pathology (SEPD) in 2025. The questionnaire collected sociodemographic data, patterns of AI use, perceptions, and educational needs. Descriptive statistics and multivariable models were applied. Results: Among 283 respondents (mean age 44.6 +/- 9.7 years), 87.5% acknowledged AI as a transformative tool, but only 60.2% (95% CI: 54.3-66.1%) reported using it, mostly outside institutional frameworks. Notably, 80.2% of users initiated AI use within the past year. Independent predictors of frequent use included previous training (OR=2.44), employment in university hospitals (OR=2.14), and younger age (OR=1.36 per 5-year decrease). Main barriers were lack of training (61%), absence of institutional strategies (46%), and ethical concerns (50%). While 93.8% agreed that AI training programmes are necessary, only 18.4% had received formal training. Conclusions: A substantial gap exists between the favorable perception of AI and its actual integration into clinical practice within Spanish gastroenterology. The rapid adoption outside institutional frameworks underscores the urgent need for accredited training programmes and governance standards led by scientific societies.</p></details> |  |
