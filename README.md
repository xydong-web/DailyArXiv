| **[Quantum oracles give an advantage for identifying classical counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13692v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that quantum oracles provide an advantage over classical oracles for answering classical counterfactual questions in causal models, or equivalently, for identifying unknown causal parameters such as distributions over functional dependences. In structural causal models with discrete classical variables, observational data and even ideal interventions generally fail to answer all counterfactual questions, since different causal parameters can reproduce the same observational and interventional data while disagreeing on counterfactuals. Using a simple binary example, we demonstrate that if the classical variables of interest are encoded in quantum systems and the causal dependence among them is encoded in a quantum oracle, coherently querying the oracle enables the identification of all causal parameters -- hence all classical counterfactuals. We generalize this to arbitrary finite cardinalities and prove that coherent probing 1) allows the identification of all two-way joint counterfactuals p(Y_x=y, Y_{x'}=y'), which is not possible with any number of queries to a classical oracle, and 2) provides tighter bounds on higher-order multi-way counterfactuals than with a classical oracle. This work can also be viewed as an extension to traditional quantum oracle problems such as Deutsch--Jozsa to identifying more causal parameters beyond just, e.g., whether a function is constant or balanced. Finally, we raise the question of whether this quantum advantage relies on uniquely non-classical features like contextuality. We provide some evidence against this by showing that in the binary case, oracles in some classically-explainable theories like Spekkens' toy theory also give rise to a counterfactual identifiability advantage over strictly classical oracles.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+4 p...</summary><p>5+4 pages.

| **[SCR2-ST: Combine Single Cell with Spatial Transcriptomics for Efficient Active Sampling via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13635v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is an emerging technology that enables researchers to investigate the molecular relationships underlying tissue morphology. However, acquiring ST data remains prohibitively expensive, and traditional fixed-grid sampling strategies lead to redundant measurements of morphologically similar or biologically uninformative regions, thus resulting in scarce data that constrain current methods. The well-established single-cell sequencing field, however, could provide rich biological data as an effective auxiliary source to mitigate this limitation. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SCR2-ST, a unified framework that leverages single-cell prior knowledge to guide efficient data acquisition and accurate expression prediction. SCR2-ST integrates a single-cell guided reinforcement learning-based (SCRL) active sampling and a hybrid regression-retrieval prediction network SCR2Net. SCRL combines single-cell foundation model embeddings with spatial density information to construct biologically grounded reward signals, enabling selective acquisition of informative tissue regions under constrained sequencing budgets. SCR2Net then leverages the actively sampled data through a hybrid architecture combining regression-based modeling with retrieval-augmented inference, where a majority cell-type filtering mechanism suppresses noisy matches and retrieved expression profiles serve as soft labels for auxiliary supervision. We evaluated SCR2-ST on three public ST datasets, demonstrating SOTA performance in both sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly under low-budget scenarios. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/hrlblab/SCR2ST</p></details> |  |

No foundation model currently exists for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), despite its use for breast cancer screening. To develop and evaluate a foundation model for DBT (DBT-DINO) across multiple clinical tasks and assess the impact of domain-specific pre-training. Self-supervised pre-training was performed using the DINOv2 methodology on over 25 million 2D slices from 487,975 DBT volumes from 27,990 patients. Three downstream tasks were evaluated: (1) breast density classification using 5,000 screening exams; (2) 5-year risk of developing breast cancer using 106,417 screening exams; and (3) lesion detection using 393 annotated volumes. For breast density classification, DBT-DINO achieved an accuracy of 0.79 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.81), outperforming both the MetaAI DINOv2 baseline (0.73, 95\% CI: 0.70--0.76, p<.001) and DenseNet-121 (0.74, 95\% CI: 0.71--0.76, p<.001). For 5-year breast cancer risk prediction, DBT-DINO achieved an AUROC of 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.80) compared to DINOv2's 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.74--0.78, p=.57). For lesion detection, DINOv2 achieved a higher average sensitivity of 0.67 (95\% CI: 0.60--0.74) compared to DBT-DINO with 0.62 (95\% CI: 0.53--0.71, p=.60). DBT-DINO demonstrated better performance on cancerous lesions specifically with a detection rate of 78.8\% compared to Dinov2's 77.3\%. Using a dataset of unprecedented size, we developed DBT-DINO, the first foundation model for DBT. DBT-DINO demonstrated strong performance on breast density classification and cancer risk prediction. However, domain-specific pre-training showed variable benefits on the detection task, with ImageNet baseline outperforming DBT-DINO on general lesion detection, indicating that localized detection tasks require further methodological development.</p></details> |  |

| **[Near-Field Perception for Safety Enhancement of Autonomous Mobile Robots in Manufacturing Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13561v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Near-field perception is essential for the safe operation of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in manufacturing environments. Conventional ranging sensors such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and ultrasonic devices provide broad situational awareness but often fail to detect small objects near the robot base. To address this limitation, this paper presents a three-tier near-field perception framework. The first approach employs light-discontinuity detection, which projects a laser stripe across the near-field zone and identifies interruptions in the stripe to perform fast, binary cutoff sensing for obstacle presence. The second approach utilizes light-displacement measurement to estimate object height by analyzing the geometric displacement of a projected stripe in the camera image, which provides quantitative obstacle height information with minimal computational overhead. The third approach employs a computer vision-based object detection model on embedded AI hardware to classify objects, enabling semantic perception and context-aware safety decisions. All methods are implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 system, achieving real-time performance at 25 or 50 frames per second. Experimental evaluation and comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy balances precision, computation, and cost, thereby providing a scalable perception solution for enabling safe operations of AMRs in manufacturing environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 54th SME North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC 54)</p></details> |

| **[A Class of Accelerated Fixed-Point-Based Methods with Delayed Inexact Oracles and Its Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13547v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a novel accelerated fixed-point-based framework using delayed inexact oracles to approximate a fixed point of a nonexpansive operator (or equivalently, a root of a co-coercive operator), a central problem in scientific computing. Our approach leverages both Nesterov's acceleration technique and the Krasnosel'skii-Mann (KM) iteration, while accounting for delayed inexact oracles, a key mechanism in asynchronous algorithms. We also introduce a unified approximate error condition for delayed inexact oracles, which can cover various practical scenarios. Under mild conditions and appropriate parameter updates, we establish both $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ non-asymptotic and $o(1/k^2)$ asymptotic convergence rates in expectation for the squared norm of residual. Our rate significantly improves the $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ rates in classical KM-type methods, including their asynchronous variants. We also establish $o(1/k^2)$ almost sure convergence rates and the almost sure convergence of iterates to a solution of the problem. Within our framework, we instantiate three settings for the underlying operator: (i) a deterministic universal delayed oracle; (ii) a stochastic delayed oracle; and (iii) a finite-sum structure with asynchronous updates. For each case, we instantiate our framework to obtain a concrete algorithmic variant for which our convergence results still apply, and whose iteration complexity depends linearly on the maximum delay. Finally, we verify our algorithms and theoretical results through two numerical examples on both matrix game and shallow neural network training problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |

We introduce LightTopoGAT, a lightweight graph attention network that enhances node features through topological augmentation by incorporating node degree and local clustering coefficient to improve graph representation learning. The proposed approach maintains parameter efficiency through streamlined attention mechanisms while integrating structural information that is typically overlooked by local message passing schemes. Through comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, MUTAG, ENZYMES, and PROTEINS, we show that LightTopoGAT achieves superior performance compared to established baselines including GCN, GraphSAGE, and standard GAT, with a 6.6 percent improvement in accuracy on MUTAG and a 2.2 percent improvement on PROTEINS. Ablation studies further confirm that these performance gains arise directly from the inclusion of topological features, demonstrating a simple yet effective strategy for enhancing graph neural network performance without increasing architectural complexity.</p></details> | 9 pages |

In this work, we propose DiffusionBrowser, a model-agnostic, lightweight decoder framework that allows users to interactively generate previews at any point (timestep or transformer block) during the denoising process. Our model can generate multi-modal preview representations that include RGB and scene intrinsics at more than 4$\times$ real-time speed (less than 1 second for a 4-second video) that convey consistent appearance and motion to the final video. With the trained decoder, we show that it is possible to interactively guide the generation at intermediate noise steps via stochasticity reinjection and modal steering, unlocking a new control capability. Moreover, we systematically probe the model using the learned decoders, revealing how scene, object, and other details are composed and assembled during the otherwise black-box denoising process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://susunghong.github.io/DiffusionBrowser</p></details> |

However, existing detection methods provide only limited exploration of the 3D geometric patterns present in generated videos. In this paper, we use vanishing points as an explicit representation of 3D geometry patterns, revealing fundamental discrepancies in geometric consistency between real and AI-generated videos. We introduce Grab-3D, a geometry-aware transformer framework for detecting AI-generated videos based on 3D geometric temporal consistency. To enable reliable evaluation, we construct an AI-generated video dataset of static scenes, allowing stable 3D geometric feature extraction. We propose a geometry-aware transformer equipped with geometric positional encoding, temporal-geometric attention, and an EMA-based geometric classifier head to explicitly inject 3D geometric awareness into temporal modeling. Experiments demonstrate that Grab-3D significantly outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, achieving robust cross-domain generalization to unseen generators.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Models Can Leverage Human Videos for Dexterous Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13644v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous manipulation is challenging because it requires understanding how subtle hand motion influences the environment through contact with objects. We introduce DexWM, a Dexterous Manipulation World Model that predicts the next latent state of the environment conditioned on past states and dexterous actions. To overcome the scarcity of dexterous manipulation datasets, DexWM is trained on over 900 hours of human and non-dexterous robot videos. To enable fine-grained dexterity, we find that predicting visual features alone is insufficient; therefore, we introduce an auxiliary hand consistency loss that enforces accurate hand configurations. DexWM outperforms prior world models conditioned on text, navigation, and full-body actions, achieving more accurate predictions of future states. DexWM also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen manipulation skills when deployed on a Franka Panda arm equipped with an Allegro gripper, outperforming Diffusion Policy by over 50% on average in grasping, placing, and reaching tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlurDM: A Blur Diffusion Model for Image Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03979v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models show promise for dynamic scene deblurring; however, existing studies often fail to leverage the intrinsic nature of the blurring process within diffusion models, limiting their full potential. To address it, we present a Blur Diffusion Model (BlurDM), which seamlessly integrates the blur formation process into diffusion for image deblurring. Observing that motion blur stems from continuous exposure, BlurDM implicitly models the blur formation process through a dual-diffusion forward scheme, diffusing both noise and blur onto a sharp image. During the reverse generation process, we derive a dual denoising and deblurring formulation, enabling BlurDM to recover the sharp image by simultaneously denoising and deblurring, given pure Gaussian noise conditioned on the blurred image as input. Additionally, to efficiently integrate BlurDM into deblurring networks, we perform BlurDM in the latent space, forming a flexible prior generation network for deblurring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BlurDM significantly and consistently enhances existing deblurring methods on four benchmark datasets.

LiMo targets both realistic high-frequency detail prediction and accurate illuminance estimation. To account for both, we propose generating a set of mirrored and diffuse spheres at different exposures, based on their 3D positions in the input. Making use of diffusion priors, we fine-tune powerful existing diffusion models on a large-scale customized dataset of indoor and outdoor scenes, paired with spatiotemporal light probes. For accurate spatial conditioning, we demonstrate that depth alone is insufficient and we introduce a new geometric condition to provide the relative position of the scene to the target 3D position. Finally, we combine diffuse and mirror predictions at different exposures into a single HDRI map leveraging differentiable rendering. We thoroughly evaluate our method and design choices to establish LiMo as state-of-the-art for both spatial control and prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

In structural causal models with discrete classical variables, observational data and even ideal interventions generally fail to answer all counterfactual questions, since different causal parameters can reproduce the same observational and interventional data while disagreeing on counterfactuals. Using a simple binary example, we demonstrate that if the classical variables of interest are encoded in quantum systems and the causal dependence among them is encoded in a quantum oracle, coherently querying the oracle enables the identification of all causal parameters -- hence all classical counterfactuals. We generalize this to arbitrary finite cardinalities and prove that coherent probing 1) allows the identification of all two-way joint counterfactuals p(Y_x=y, Y_{x'}=y'), which is not possible with any number of queries to a classical oracle, and 2) provides tighter bounds on higher-order multi-way counterfactuals than with a classical oracle. This work can also be viewed as an extension to traditional quantum oracle problems such as Deutsch--Jozsa to identifying more causal parameters beyond just, e.g., whether a function is constant or balanced. Finally, we raise the question of whether this quantum advantage relies on uniquely non-classical features like contextuality. We provide some evidence against this by showing that in the binary case, oracles in some classically-explainable theories like Spekkens' toy theory also give rise to a counterfactual identifiability advantage over strictly classical oracles.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+4 p...</summary><p>5+4 pages.

Nowadays, when we can use remote sensing techniques for Big Data acquisition, the issues such data introduce are as important as ever. One of those concerns is the processing of the data.

To quantify how and explain why the performance of our model changed when ran on a real device, we propose new explainability metrics.

Conventional ranging sensors such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and ultrasonic devices provide broad situational awareness but often fail to detect small objects near the robot base. To address this limitation, this paper presents a three-tier near-field perception framework. The first approach employs light-discontinuity detection, which projects a laser stripe across the near-field zone and identifies interruptions in the stripe to perform fast, binary cutoff sensing for obstacle presence. The second approach utilizes light-displacement measurement to estimate object height by analyzing the geometric displacement of a projected stripe in the camera image, which provides quantitative obstacle height information with minimal computational overhead. The third approach employs a computer vision-based object detection model on embedded AI hardware to classify objects, enabling semantic perception and context-aware safety decisions. All methods are implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 system, achieving real-time performance at 25 or 50 frames per second. Experimental evaluation and comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy balances precision, computation, and cost, thereby providing a scalable perception solution for enabling safe operations of AMRs in manufacturing environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 54th SME North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC 54)</p></details> |

We also introduce a unified approximate error condition for delayed inexact oracles, which can cover various practical scenarios.

However, large increases in computing power and the greater availability of Big Data have dramatically increased the probability of re-identifying anonymized data, potentially violating the pledge of confidentiality given to survey respondents. Data science tools can be used to produce synthetic data that preserve critical moments of the empirical data but do not contain the records of any existing individual respondent or business. Developing public-use firm data from surveys presents unique challenges different from demographic data, because there is a lack of anonymity and certain industries can be easily identified in each geographic area. This paper briefly describes a machine learning model used to construct a synthetic PUMS based on the Annual Business Survey (ABS) and discusses various quality metrics. Although the ABS PUMS is currently being refined and results are confidential, we present two synthetic PUMS developed for the 2007 Survey of Business Owners, similar to the ABS business data. Econometric replication of a high impact analysis published in Small Business Economics demonstrates the verisimilitude of the synthetic data to the true data and motivates discussion of possible ABS use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

A collection of 326,060 z-scores from MEDLINE abstracts (2000-2018) provides context for interpreting individual studies; we formalize this as an empirical Bayes task complicated by selection bias. We address selection bias through a selective tilting approach that extends empirical Bayes confidence intervals to truncated sampling mechanisms. Sign information is unreliable (a positive z-score need not indicate benefit, and investigators may choose contrast directions post hoc), so we work with absolute z-scores and identify only the distribution of absolute signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Our framework provides coverage guarantees for functionals including posterior estimands describing idealized replications and the symmetrized posterior mean, which we justify decision-theoretically as optimal among sign-equivariant (odd) estimators and minimax among priors inducing the same absolute SNR distribution.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we describe an AI-driven "Reproducibility Copilot" that analyzes manuscripts, code, and supplementary materials to generate structured Jupyter Notebooks and recommendations aimed at facilitating computational, or "rote", reproducibility. Our initial results suggest that the copilot has the potential to substantially reduce reproduction time (in one case from over 30 hours to about 1 hour) while achieving high coverage of figures, tables, and results suitable for computational reproduction. The system systematically detects barriers to reproducibility, including missing values for hyperparameters, undocumented preprocessing steps, and incomplete or inaccessible datasets. Although preliminary, these findings suggest that AI tools can meaningfully reduce the burden of reproducibility efforts and contribute to more transparent and verifiable scientific communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repro...</summary><p>Reproducible Artificial Intelligence (RAI2026) Workshop, AAAI 2026</p></details> |

| **[Quantum oracles give an advantage for identifying classical counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13692v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that quantum oracles provide an advantage over classical oracles for answering classical counterfactual questions in causal models, or equivalently, for identifying unknown causal parameters such as distributions over functional dependences. In structural causal models with discrete classical variables, observational data and even ideal interventions generally fail to answer all counterfactual questions, since different causal parameters can reproduce the same observational and interventional data while disagreeing on counterfactuals. Using a simple binary example, we demonstrate that if the classical variables of interest are encoded in quantum systems and the causal dependence among them is encoded in a quantum oracle, coherently querying the oracle enables the identification of all causal parameters -- hence all classical counterfactuals. We generalize this to arbitrary finite cardinalities and prove that coherent probing 1) allows the identification of all two-way joint counterfactuals p(Y_x=y, Y_{x'}=y'), which is not possible with any number of queries to a classical oracle, and 2) provides tighter bounds on higher-order multi-way counterfactuals than with a classical oracle. This work can also be viewed as an extension to traditional quantum oracle problems such as Deutsch--Jozsa to identifying more causal parameters beyond just, e.g., whether a function is constant or balanced. Finally, we raise the question of whether this quantum advantage relies on uniquely non-classical features like contextuality. We provide some evidence against this by showing that in the binary case, oracles in some classically-explainable theories like Spekkens' toy theory also give rise to a counterfactual identifiability advantage over strictly classical oracles.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+4 p...</summary><p>5+4 pages.

| **[DBT-DINO: Towards Foundation model based analysis of Digital Breast Tomosynthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13608v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have shown promise in medical imaging but remain underexplored for three-dimensional imaging modalities. No foundation model currently exists for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), despite its use for breast cancer screening. To develop and evaluate a foundation model for DBT (DBT-DINO) across multiple clinical tasks and assess the impact of domain-specific pre-training. Self-supervised pre-training was performed using the DINOv2 methodology on over 25 million 2D slices from 487,975 DBT volumes from 27,990 patients. Three downstream tasks were evaluated: (1) breast density classification using 5,000 screening exams; (2) 5-year risk of developing breast cancer using 106,417 screening exams; and (3) lesion detection using 393 annotated volumes. For breast density classification, DBT-DINO achieved an accuracy of 0.79 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.81), outperforming both the MetaAI DINOv2 baseline (0.73, 95\% CI: 0.70--0.76, p<.001) and DenseNet-121 (0.74, 95\% CI: 0.71--0.76, p<.001). For 5-year breast cancer risk prediction, DBT-DINO achieved an AUROC of 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.80) compared to DINOv2's 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.74--0.78, p=.57). For lesion detection, DINOv2 achieved a higher average sensitivity of 0.67 (95\% CI: 0.60--0.74) compared to DBT-DINO with 0.62 (95\% CI: 0.53--0.71, p=.60). DBT-DINO demonstrated better performance on cancerous lesions specifically with a detection rate of 78.8\% compared to Dinov2's 77.3\%. Using a dataset of unprecedented size, we developed DBT-DINO, the first foundation model for DBT. DBT-DINO demonstrated strong performance on breast density classification and cancer risk prediction. However, domain-specific pre-training showed variable benefits on the detection task, with ImageNet baseline outperforming DBT-DINO on general lesion detection, indicating that localized detection tasks require further methodological development.</p></details> |  |

Nowadays, when we can use remote sensing techniques for Big Data acquisition, the issues such data introduce are as important as ever. One of those concerns is the processing of the data. Classical methods often fail to address that problem or are incapable of processing the data in a reasonable time. With that in mind information system engineers are required to investigate different approaches to the data processing. The recent advancements in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices implementation allow us to investigate their application to real-life computational problem. This field of study is called quantum (information) systems engineering and usually focuses on technical problems with the contemporary devices. However, hardware challenges are not the only ones that hinder our quantum computation capabilities. Software limitations are the other, less explored side of this medal. Using multispectral image segmentation as a task example, we investigated how difficult it is to run a hybrid quantum-classical model on a real, publicly available quantum device. To quantify how and explain why the performance of our model changed when ran on a real device, we propose new explainability metrics. These metrics introduce new meaning to the explainable quantum machine learning; the explanation of the performance issue comes from the quantum device behavior. We also analyzed the expected money costs of running similar experiment on contemporary quantum devices using standard market prices.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Near-Field Perception for Safety Enhancement of Autonomous Mobile Robots in Manufacturing Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13561v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Near-field perception is essential for the safe operation of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in manufacturing environments. Conventional ranging sensors such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and ultrasonic devices provide broad situational awareness but often fail to detect small objects near the robot base. To address this limitation, this paper presents a three-tier near-field perception framework. The first approach employs light-discontinuity detection, which projects a laser stripe across the near-field zone and identifies interruptions in the stripe to perform fast, binary cutoff sensing for obstacle presence. The second approach utilizes light-displacement measurement to estimate object height by analyzing the geometric displacement of a projected stripe in the camera image, which provides quantitative obstacle height information with minimal computational overhead. The third approach employs a computer vision-based object detection model on embedded AI hardware to classify objects, enabling semantic perception and context-aware safety decisions. All methods are implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 system, achieving real-time performance at 25 or 50 frames per second. Experimental evaluation and comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy balances precision, computation, and cost, thereby providing a scalable perception solution for enabling safe operations of AMRs in manufacturing environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 54th SME North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC 54)</p></details> |

Our approach leverages both Nesterov's acceleration technique and the Krasnosel'skii-Mann (KM) iteration, while accounting for delayed inexact oracles, a key mechanism in asynchronous algorithms. We also introduce a unified approximate error condition for delayed inexact oracles, which can cover various practical scenarios. Under mild conditions and appropriate parameter updates, we establish both $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ non-asymptotic and $o(1/k^2)$ asymptotic convergence rates in expectation for the squared norm of residual. Our rate significantly improves the $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ rates in classical KM-type methods, including their asynchronous variants. We also establish $o(1/k^2)$ almost sure convergence rates and the almost sure convergence of iterates to a solution of the problem. Within our framework, we instantiate three settings for the underlying operator: (i) a deterministic universal delayed oracle; (ii) a stochastic delayed oracle; and (iii) a finite-sum structure with asynchronous updates. For each case, we instantiate our framework to obtain a concrete algorithmic variant for which our convergence results still apply, and whose iteration complexity depends linearly on the maximum delay. Finally, we verify our algorithms and theoretical results through two numerical examples on both matrix game and shallow neural network training problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |
