| **[Crystal Structure Prediction with a Geometric Permutation-Invariant Loss Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00832v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17 benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Environments for Organoid Intelligence with LLM-Automated Design and Plasticity-Based Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04633v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the complexity of artificial agents increases, the design of environments that can effectively shape their behavior and capabilities has become a critical research frontier. We propose a framework that extends this principle to a novel class of agents: biological neural networks in the form of neural organoids. This paper introduces three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train organoid-based biological agents and probe the underlying mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments with increasing complexity: (1) a conditional avoidance task, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation. Furthermore, we propose a novel meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to automate the generation and optimization of experimental protocols, scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal approach for evaluating learning by measuring synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between computational neuroscience and agent-based AI, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, learning, and intelligence in a controlled biological substrate.</p></details> |  |

| **[One Small Step with Fingerprints, One Giant Leap for De Novo Molecule Generation from Mass Spectra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04180v3)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common approach to the de novo molecular generation problem from mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into molecular structures. In our work, we adopt MIST as the encoder and MolForge as the decoder, leveraging additional training data to enhance performance. We also threshold the probabilities of each fingerprint bit to focus on the presence of substructures. This results in a tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1 28% / top-10 36% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra in MassSpecGym. We position this as a strong baseline for future research in de novo molecule elucidation from mass spectra.</p></details> |  |
| **[SurGBSA: Learning Representations From Molecular Dynamics Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03084v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised pretraining from static structures of drug-like compounds and proteins enable powerful learned feature representations. Learned features demonstrate state of the art performance on a range of predictive tasks including molecular properties, structure generation, and protein-ligand interactions. The majority of approaches are limited by their use of static structures and it remains an open question, how best to use atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to develop more generalized models to improve prediction accuracy for novel molecular structures. We present SURrogate mmGBSA (SurGBSA) as a new modeling approach for MD-based representation learning, which learns a surrogate function of the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA). We show for the first time the benefits of physics-informed pre-training to train a surrogate MMGBSA model on a collection of over 1.4 million 3D trajectories collected from MD simulations of the CASF-2016 benchmark. SurGBSA demonstrates a dramatic 6,497x speedup versus a traditional physics-based single-point MMGBSA calculation while nearly matching single-point MMGBSA accuracy on the challenging pose ranking problem for identification of the correct top pose (-0.4% difference). Our work advances the development of molecular foundation models by showing model improvements when training on MD simulations. Models, code and training data are made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prior-Guided Flow Matching for Target-Aware Molecule Design with Learnable Atom Number](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01486v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structure-based drug design (SBDD), aiming to generate 3D molecules with high binding affinity toward target proteins, is a vital approach in novel drug discovery. Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated molecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry. Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable 3D Molecular Generation for Structure-Based Drug Design Through Bayesian Flow Networks and Gradient Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21468v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility, and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug discovery applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-Classical Hybrid Molecular Autoencoder for Advancing Classical Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19394v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent advances in quantum machine learning (QML) offer significant potential for enhancing generative models, particularly in molecular design, a large array of classical approaches still face challenges in achieving high fidelity and validity. In particular, the integration of QML with sequence-based tasks, such as Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) string reconstruction, remains underexplored and usually suffers from fidelity degradation. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical architecture for SMILES reconstruction that integrates quantum encoding with classical sequence modeling to improve quantum fidelity and classical similarity. Our approach achieves a quantum fidelity of approximately 84% and a classical reconstruction similarity of 60%, surpassing existing quantum baselines. Our work lays a promising foundation for future QML applications, striking a balance between expressive quantum representations and classical sequence models and catalyzing broader research on quantum-aware sequence models for molecular and drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoneyBee: A Scalable Modular Framework for Creating Multimodal Oncology Datasets with Foundational Embedding Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07460v5)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>HONeYBEE (Harmonized ONcologY Biomedical Embedding Encoder) is an open-source framework that integrates multimodal biomedical data for oncology applications. It processes clinical data (structured and unstructured), whole-slide images, radiology scans, and molecular profiles to generate unified patient-level embeddings using domain-specific foundation models and fusion strategies. These embeddings enable survival prediction, cancer-type classification, patient similarity retrieval, and cohort clustering. Evaluated on 11,400+ patients across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), clinical embeddings showed the strongest single-modality performance with 98.5% classification accuracy and 96.4% precision@10 in patient retrieval. They also achieved the highest survival prediction concordance indices across most cancer types. Multimodal fusion provided complementary benefits for specific cancers, improving overall survival prediction beyond clinical features alone. Comparative evaluation of four large language models revealed that general-purpose models like Qwen3 outperformed specialized medical models for clinical text representation, though task-specific fine-tuning improved performance on heterogeneous data such as pathology reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-Based Flow Matching for Generating 3D Molecular Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18949v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular structure generation is a fundamental problem that involves determining the 3D positions of molecules' constituents. It has crucial biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to \textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar computational budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Conference on Machine Learning (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Instruction-Based Molecular Graph Generation with Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09896v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in computational chemistry have increasingly focused on synthesizing molecules based on textual instructions. Integrating graph generation with these instructions is complex, leading most current methods to use molecular sequences with pre-trained large language models. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework, named $\textbf{UTGDiff (Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model)}$, which utilizes language models for discrete graph diffusion to generate molecular graphs from instructions. UTGDiff features a unified text-graph transformer as the denoising network, derived from pre-trained language models and minimally modified to process graph data through attention bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that UTGDiff consistently outperforms sequence-based baselines in tasks involving instruction-based molecule generation and editing, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters given an equivalent level of pretraining corpus. Our code is availble at https://github.com/ran1812/UTGDiff.</p></details> | ECAI 2025 |
| **[Enhancing Chemical Explainability Through Counterfactual Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18561v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular property prediction is a crucial task that guides the design of new compounds, including drugs and materials. While explainable artificial intelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying influential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking strategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance via fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the underlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In this work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from generative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating masked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them relative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our method offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and distribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that directly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties. We demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking model explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets and property prediction tasks. Our approach bridges the gap between explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path toward explainable machine learning in chemistry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning for Stable Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16521v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models. Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The code is available at: https://github.com/ZhijianZhou/RLPF/tree/verl_diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[NovoMolGen: Rethinking Molecular Language Model Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13408v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$ possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations, Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules. However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies, model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5 billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.</p></details> |  |

Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks (GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared to standard ADMM.

| **[Combining feature-based approaches with graph neural networks and symbolic regression for synergistic performance and interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03547v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces MatterVial, an innovative hybrid framework for feature-based machine learning in materials science. MatterVial expands the feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based (MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to, state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted and autonomous materials discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[RapidGNN: Energy and Communication-Efficient Distributed Training on Large-Scale Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05207v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to 3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2505.10806</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing 3D Point Cloud Classification with ModelNet-R and Point-SkipNet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05198v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classification of 3D point clouds is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, the commonly used ModelNet40 dataset suffers from limitations such as inconsistent labeling, 2D data, size mismatches, and inadequate class differentiation, which hinder model performance. This paper introduces ModelNet-R, a meticulously refined version of ModelNet40 designed to address these issues and serve as a more reliable benchmark. Additionally, this paper proposes Point-SkipNet, a lightweight graph-based neural network that leverages efficient sampling, neighborhood grouping, and skip connections to achieve high classification accuracy with reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained in ModelNet-R exhibit significant performance improvements. Notably, Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with a substantially lower parameter count compared to contemporary models. This research highlights the crucial role of dataset quality in optimizing model efficiency for 3D point cloud classification.

| **[Hybrid Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05115v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, methods that combine contrastive learning with graph neural networks have emerged to address the challenges of recommendation systems, demonstrating powerful performance and playing a significant role in this domain. Contrastive learning primarily tackles the issue of data sparsity by employing data augmentation strategies, effectively alleviating this problem and showing promising results. Although existing research has achieved favorable outcomes, most current graph contrastive learning methods are based on two types of data augmentation strategies: the first involves perturbing the graph structure, such as by randomly adding or removing edges; and the second applies clustering techniques. We believe that the interactive information obtained through these two strategies does not fully capture the user-item interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel method called HMFGCL (Hybrid Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning), which integrates two distinct matrix factorization techniques-low-rank matrix factorization (MF) and singular value decomposition (SVD)-to complementarily acquire global collaborative information, thereby constructing enhanced views. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, particularly on small-scale datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Unlearning: Efficient Node Removal in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04785v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network (GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inferring the Graph Structure of Images for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04677v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image datasets such as MNIST are a key benchmark for testing Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures. The images are traditionally represented as a grid graph with each node representing a pixel and edges connecting neighboring pixels (vertically and horizontally). The graph signal is the values (intensities) of each pixel in the image. The graphs are commonly used as input to graph neural networks (e.g., Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (Graph CNNs) [1, 2], Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [3], GatedGCN [4]) to classify the images. In this work, we improve the accuracy of downstream graph neural network tasks by finding alternative graphs to the grid graph and superpixel methods to represent the dataset images, following the approach in [5, 6]. We find row correlation, column correlation, and product graphs for each image in MNIST and Fashion-MNIST using correlations between the pixel values building on the method in [5, 6]. Experiments show that using these different graph representations and features as input into downstream GNN models improves the accuracy over using the traditional grid graph and superpixel methods in the literature.</p></details> |  |

While classical approaches such as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP, TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our results show that simpler models such as GCN, SAGE, or APPNP often outperform more complex alternatives in low-data regimes, while GAT ranks among the strongest architectures in our benchmarks, combining high accuracy with valuable interpretability. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights, revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial dependencies are prominent. Additionally, we demonstrate that ensemble-based expert aggregation strategies, particularly bottom-up combinations, significantly improve robustness and yield state-of-the-art performance across both datasets. These findings highlight the dual promise of GNNs for accurate and interpretable forecasting, and suggest that architectural simplicity coupled with ensemble methods can provide a practical path forward for transparent energy analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, ECML PKDD 2025 Workshop paper</p></details> |

We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level. TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns. Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, the process is often subjective, with variability between experts. As a result, numerous deep learning-based automatic classification methods have emerged, most of which focus on respiratory sound classification. In contrast, research on respiratory sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, limiting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally, the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for abnormal respiratory sound events. Our method improves both the flexibility and applicability of respiratory sound detection. Experiments on the SPRSound 2024 and HF Lung V1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and incorporating respiratory position information enhances the discrimination between abnormal sounds.

Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems. However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments. Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using gradient-based optimization methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring a Graph-based Approach to Offline Reinforcement Learning for Sepsis Treatment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03393v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time. Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the complexity of representation learning in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>18th ...</summary><p>18th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Transformer-Guided Content-Adaptive Graph Learning for Hyperspectral Unmixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03376v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances. Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency, making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work, T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Select MCP Algorithms: From Traditional ML to Dual-Channel GAT-MLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08005v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive experiments and prior studies show that no single maximum clique algorithm consistently performs best across all instances, highlighting the importance of selecting suitable algorithms based on instance features. Through an extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of research work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to address this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP algorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by structural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first evaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple dataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong performance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline. In addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and topological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building on these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model shows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of graph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, as of yet, the analysis of social networks using the time series of people's mobile connectivity data has not been extensively investigated. In the present study, we investigate four snapshot - based temporal GNNs in predicting the phone call and SMS activity between users of a mobile communication network. In addition, we develop a simple non - GNN baseline model using recently proposed EdgeBank method. Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms the baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on average worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches hold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile connectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin between ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on specialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Can Large Language Models Act as Ensembler for Multi-GNNs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16822v5)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, GNNs lack the inherent semantic understanding capability of rich textual node attributes, limiting their effectiveness in applications. On the other hand, we empirically observe that for existing GNN models, no one can consistently outperforms others across diverse datasets. In this paper, we study whether LLMs can act as an ensembler for multi-GNNs and propose the LensGNN model. The model first aligns multiple GNNs, mapping the representations of different GNNs into the same space. Then, through LoRA fine-tuning, it aligns the space between the GNN and the LLM, injecting graph tokens and textual information into LLMs. This allows LensGNN to ensemble multiple GNNs and take advantage of the strengths of LLM, leading to a deeper understanding of both textual semantic information and graph structural information. The experimental results show that LensGNN outperforms existing models. This research advances text-attributed graph ensemble learning by providing a robust and superior solution for integrating semantic and structural information.

However, the reliability of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not just a modeling artifact.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Fall Symposium: AI Trustworthiness and Risk Assessment for Challenged Contexts (ATRACC)</p></details> |

While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by up to 12% on MSE and 6% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

While recent work has advanced the identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported, redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Train-Once Plan-Anywhere Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Diffusion Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21001v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety, thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree (DiTree): a provably-generalizable framework leveraging diffusion policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness of SBPs to yield provably-safe solutions within a few action propagation iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler trained on a single environment. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD scenarios, DiTree achieves on average a 30% higher success rate compared to standalone DP or SBPs, on a dynamic car and Mujoco's ant robot settings (for the latter, SBPs fail completely). Beyond simulation, real-world car experiments confirm DiTree's applicability, demonstrating superior trajectory quality and robustness even under severe sim-to-real gaps.

When these systems have a natural block structure due to multiple field variables, using iterative solvers with carefully designed preconditioning strategies that exploit the underlying physical structure becomes necessary for an efficient and scalable solution process. FEniCSx Preconditioning Tools (FEniCSx-pctools) is a software package that eases the specification of PETSc (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation) block preconditioning strategies on linear systems assembled using the DOLFINx finite element solver of the FEniCS Project. The package automatically attaches all necessary metadata so that preconditioning strategies can be applied via PETSc's standard options database to monolithic and block assembled systems. The documented examples include a simple mixed Poisson system and more complex pressure convection-diffusion approach to preconditioning the Navier-Stokes equations. We show weak parallel scaling on a fully coupled temperature-Navier-Stokes system up to 8192 MPI (Message Passing Interface) processes, demonstrating the applicability of the approach to large-scale problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

To address the challenge of aligning complex garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence, where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots, cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size, allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not available.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-resolution efficient image generation from WiFi CSI using a pretrained latent diffusion model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10605v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines, enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Synthetic Acceleration Preconditioners for Parametric Radiative Transfer Equations based on Trajectory-Aware Reduced Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05001v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) arises in multi-query applications, such as design optimization, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification, which require solving the RTE multiple times for various parameters. Classical synthetic acceleration (SA) preconditioners are designed based on low-order approximations of a kinetic correction equation, e.g., its diffusion limit in diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Despite their widespread success, these methods rely on empirical physical assumptions and do not leverage low-rank structures across parameters of the parametric problem. To address these limitations, our previous work introduced a reduced-order model (ROM) enhanced preconditioner called ROMSAD, which exploits low-rank structures across parameters and the original kinetic description of the correction equation. While ROMSAD improves overall efficiency compared with DSA, its efficiency reduces after the first iteration, because the construction of the underlying ROM ignores the preconditioner-dependence of the residual trajectory, leading to a mismatch between the offline and online residual trajectories. To overcome this issue, we introduce a trajectory-aware framework that iteratively constructs ROMs to eliminate the mismatch between offline and online residual trajectories. Numerical tests demonstrate superior efficiency over DSA, and substantial gains in both efficiency and robustness over ROMSAD. For a parametric lattice problem, trajectory-aware ROM preconditioners achieve rapid convergence within only $2$-$3$ iterations online.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

Existing diffusion-based VLA policies require multi-billion-parameter models and massive datasets to achieve strong performance. We tackle this efficiency challenge with two contributions: intermediate-modality fusion, which reallocates capacity to the diffusion head by pruning up to $50\%$ of LLM layers, and action-specific Global-AdaLN conditioning, which cuts parameters by $20\%$ through modular adaptation. We integrate these advances into a novel 950 M-parameter VLA called FLOWER. Pretrained in just 200 H100 GPU hours, FLOWER delivers competitive performance with bigger VLAs across $190$ tasks spanning ten simulation and real-world benchmarks and demonstrates robustness across diverse robotic embodiments.

However, despite their plausibility, they may not reflect the model's true reasoning faithfully, which is crucial for understanding the model's true decision-making processes. Although several faithfulness metrics have been proposed, they are often evaluated in isolation, making direct, principled comparisons between them difficult. Here, we present Causal Diagnosticity, a framework that serves as a common testbed to evaluate faithfulness metrics for natural language explanations. Our framework employs the concept of diagnosticity, and uses model-editing methods to generate faithful-unfaithful explanation pairs. Our benchmark includes four tasks: fact-checking, analogy, object counting, and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate prominent faithfulness metrics, including post-hoc explanation and chain-of-thought-based methods. We find that diagnostic performance varies across tasks and models, with Filler Tokens performing best overall. Additionally, continuous metrics are generally more diagnostic than binary ones but can be sensitive to noise and model choice. Our results highlight the need for more robust faithfulness metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 22 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of patterns than existing object-centric datasets.

In this work, we aimed to assess existing design heuristics for categorical visualization using well-established psychological knowledge. Specifically, we examine the impact of the subitizing phenomenon in cognitive psychology -- people's ability to automatically recognize a small set of objects instantly without counting -- in data visualizations. We conducted three experiments with multi-class scatterplots -- between 2 and 15 classes with varying design choices -- across three different tasks -- class estimation, correlation comparison, and clustering judgments -- to understand how performance changes as the number of classes (and therefore set size) increases. Our results indicate if the category number is smaller than six, people tend to perform well at all tasks, providing empirical evidence of subitizing in visualization. When category numbers increased, performance fell, with the magnitude of the performance change depending on task and encoding. Our study bridges the gap between heuristic guidelines and empirical evidence by applying well-established psychological theories, suggesting future opportunities for using psychological theories and constructs to characterize visualization perception.</p></details> |  |

Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from 56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78, outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art autoregressive fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MAPR 2025</p></details> |

We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation, where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score of 0.97.</p></details> |  |
| **[UAV-VL-R1: Generalizing Vision-Language Models via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Multi-Stage GRPO for UAV Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11196v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints. These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting, transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marmot: Object-Level Self-Correction via Multi-Agent Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20054v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential solution involves employing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to construct a self-correction framework. However, these approaches heavily rely on the capabilities of the MLLMs used, often fail to account for all objects within the image, and suffer from cumulative distortions during multi-round editing processes. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting to enhance image-text alignment. First, we employ a large language model as an Object-Aware Agent to perform object-level divide-and-conquer, automatically decomposing self-correction tasks into object-centric subtasks based on image descriptions. For each subtask, we construct an Object Correction System featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism that operates exclusively on a single object's segmentation mask or the bounding boxes of object pairs, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To efficiently integrate correction results from subtasks while avoiding cumulative distortions from multi-stage editing, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother, which employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtasks, significantly improving runtime efficiency while preventing distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CountCluster: Training-Free Object Quantity Guidance with Cross-Attention Map Clustering for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10710v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose \textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity control performance across a variety of prompts.

The deployment of a SNN usually requires partitioning the network and mapping these partitions onto the hardware's processing units. However, finding optimal deployment configurations is an NP-hard problem, often addressed through optimization algorithms. While some objectives (e.g., memory utilization and chip count) are static, others (e.g., communication latency and energy efficiency) depend on the network's dynamic behavior, necessitating dynamic-aware optimization. To address this, we model SNN dynamics using an Ising-type pairwise interaction framework, bridging microscopic neuron interactions with macroscopic network behavior. We optimize deployment by exploring the parameter and configuration spaces of the Ising model. We evaluate our approach on two SNNs deployed on the sPyNNaker neuromorphic platform. Initial results suggest that the method underperforms, potentially due to the Ising model's equilibrium assumptions and the architectural complexity of real-world neuromorphic hardware, highlighting limitations in its current formulation. Update: The method proposed is with a equilibrium-dynamics SNN assumption, and the original paper does not mention this. The paper needs to be revisited and reuploaded after further experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need further experiments for conclusive results</p></details> |

| **[CAPTURe: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Occluded Object Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15485v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty in counting in images.

| **[Rational Inverse Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08983v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can observe a single, imperfect demonstration and immediately generalize to very different problem settings. Robots, in contrast, often require hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the training conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to recover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that these explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of high-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this work, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring these latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR frames few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language model iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a planner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the observed demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over concise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous manipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across variations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one demonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel settings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RS VQA datasets are constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain. RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1 then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises 13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Multimedia Conference (ACM Multimedia 2025)</p></details> |

Such limitation further restricts the model's potential to achieve nuanced visual and language referring in domains such as GUI Agents, counting, \textit{etc}. To address this issue, we introduce a unified high-resolution generalist model, Griffon v2, enabling flexible object referring with visual and textual prompts. To efficiently scale up image resolution, we design a simple and lightweight down-sampling projector to overcome the input tokens constraint in Large Language Models. This design inherently preserves the complete contexts and fine details and significantly improves multimodal perception ability, especially for small objects. Building upon this, we further equip the model with visual-language co-referring capabilities through a plug-and-play visual tokenizer. It enables user-friendly interaction with flexible target images, free-form texts, and even coordinates. Experiments demonstrate that Griffon v2 can localize objects of interest with visual and textual referring, achieve state-of-the-art performance on REC and phrase grounding, and outperform expert models in object detection, object counting, and REG.

Addressing this by annotating new data and fully retraining the model is time-consuming and does not guarantee generalization to additional novel categories at test time. Instead, we propose an alternative paradigm: Given a category name, tune a compact concept embedding derived from the prompt using synthetic images and pseudo-labels generated by a text-to-image diffusion model. This embedding conditions a specialization module that refines raw overcounts from any frozen counter into accurate, category-specific estimates\textemdash without requiring real images or human annotations. We validate our approach on \textsc{Lookalikes}, a challenging new benchmark containing 1,037 images across 27 fine-grained subcategories, and show substantial improvements over strong baselines.

| **[CountQA: How Well Do MLLMs Count in the Wild?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06585v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable fluency in understanding visual scenes, yet they exhibit a critical lack in a fundamental cognitive skill: object counting. This blind spot severely limits their reliability in real-world applications. To date, this capability has been largely unevaluated in complex scenarios, as existing benchmarks either feature sparse object densities or are confined to specific visual domains, failing to test models under realistic conditions. Addressing this gap, we introduce CountQA, a challenging new benchmark designed to probe this deficiency. Comprising over 1,500 question-answer pairs, CountQA features real-world images with high object density, clutter, and occlusion. We investigate this weakness by evaluating 15 prominent MLLMs on the CountQA benchmark and reveal that the top-performing model achieves a mere 42.9% accuracy, with performance declining as object counts rise. By providing a dedicated benchmark to diagnose and rectify this core weakness, CountQA paves the way for a new generation of MLLMs that are not only descriptively fluent but also numerically grounded and spatially aware. We will open-source the dataset and code upon paper acceptance to foster further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised deep learning model for fast energy layer pre-selection of delivery-efficient proton arc therapy plan optimization of nasopharyngeal carcinoma](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15803v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proton arc therapy (PAT) is an emerging and promising modality in radiotherapy, offering improved dose distribution and treatment robustness over intensity-modulated proton therapy. Yet, identifying the optimal energy layer (EL) sequence remains challenging due to the intensive computational demand and prolonged treatment delivery time. This study proposes an unsupervised deep learning model for fast EL pre-selection that minimizes EL switch (ELS) time while maintaining high plan quality. We introduce a novel data representation method, spot-count representation, which encodes the number of proton spots intersecting the target and organs at risk (OAR) in a matrix structured by sorted gantry angles and energy layers. This representation serves as the input of an U-Net style architecture, SPArc_dl, which is trained using a tri-objective function: maximizing spot-counts on target, minimizing spot-counts on OAR, and reducing ELS time. The model is evaluated on 35 nasopharyngeal cancer cases, and its performance is compared to SPArc_particle_swarm (SPArc_ps). SPArc_dl produces EL pre-selection that significantly improves both plan quality and delivery efficiency. Compared to SPArc_ps, it enhances the conformity index by 0.1 (p<0.01), reduces the homogeneity index by 0.71 (p<0.01), lowers the brainstem mean dose by 0.25 (p<0.01), and shortens the ELS time by 37.2% (p < 0.01). The results unintentionally reveal employing unchanged ELS is more time-wise efficient than descended ELS. SPArc_dl's inference time is within 1 second. However, SPArc_dl plan demonstrates limitation in robustness. The proposed spot-count representation lays a foundation for incorporating unsupervised deep learning approaches into EL pre-selection task. SPArc_dl is a fast tool for generating high-quality PAT plans by strategically pre-selecting EL to reduce delivery time while maintaining excellent dosimetric performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Scoring for Machine Learning Classifier Error Impact Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04489v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample. Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors. Python implementations of the scoring metrics will be available in an open-source repository at time of publication.</p></details> |  |

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on general image captioning, they often fail to capture the nuanced interpretations that fine art demands. We propose ArtRAG, a novel, training-free framework that combines structured knowledge with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multi-perspective artwork explanation. ArtRAG automatically constructs an Art Context Knowledge Graph (ACKG) from domain-specific textual sources, organizing entities such as artists, movements, themes, and historical events into a rich, interpretable graph. At inference time, a multi-granular structured retriever selects semantically and topologically relevant subgraphs to guide generation. This enables MLLMs to produce contextually grounded, culturally informed art descriptions. Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG outperforms several heavily trained baselines. Human evaluations further confirm that ArtRAG generates coherent, insightful, and culturally enriched interpretations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aesthetic Image Captioning with Saliency Enhanced MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04378v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities. However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC. Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Hubness in Multi-Modal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14113v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hubness is a phenomenon in high-dimensional vector spaces where a point from the natural distribution is unusually close to many other points. This is a well-known problem in information retrieval that causes some items to accidentally (and incorrectly) appear relevant to many queries. In this paper, we investigate how attackers can exploit hubness to turn any image or audio input in a multi-modal retrieval system into an adversarial hub. Adversarial hubs can be used to inject universal adversarial content (e.g., spam) that will be retrieved in response to thousands of different queries, and also for targeted attacks on queries related to specific, attacker-chosen concepts. We present a method for creating adversarial hubs and evaluate the resulting hubs on benchmark multi-modal retrieval datasets and an image-to-image retrieval system implemented by Pinecone, a popular vector database. For example, in text-caption-to-image retrieval, a single adversarial hub, generated using 100 random queries, is retrieved as the top-1 most relevant image for more than 21,000 out of 25,000 test queries (by contrast, the most common natural hub is the top-1 response to only 102 queries), demonstrating the strong generalization capabilities of adversarial hubs. We also investigate whether techniques for mitigating natural hubness can also mitigate adversarial hubs, and show that they are not effective against hubs that target queries related to specific concepts.</p></details> |  |

Alternatively, comparably smaller VLMs prioritize high-level scene descriptions, overlooking finer details that contribute to a richer understanding of an image. In this paper, we introduce a training-free framework that enhances caption diversity and informativeness by explicitly attending to distinct image regions using a comparably small VLM, BLIP, as the backbone. Our approach leverages structured segmentation to produce hierarchical representations that capture both global and localized semantics. Without requiring additional model training, we demonstrate that our method allows smaller VLMs to achieve performance comparable to larger models in terms of image-caption alignment, semantic integrity, and diversity. We evaluate our framework on MSCOCO, Flickr30k, and Nocaps test datasets, achieving a Div-2 score of 0.735, 0.750, and 0.748 for each dataset, respectively, while maintaining strong image-caption relevancy and semantic integrity with the human-annotated captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

However, it is well-established that these ML models are vulnerable to a number of adversarial attacks throughout the model deployment pipeline that threaten to negate battlefield advantage. One broad category is privacy attacks (such as model inversion) where an adversary can reverse engineer information from the model, such as the sensitive data used in its training. The ability to quantify the risk of model inversion attacks (MIAs) is not well studied, and there is a lack of automated developmental test and evaluation (DT&E) tools and metrics to quantify the effectiveness of privacy loss of the MIA. The current DT&E process is difficult because ML model inversions can be hard for a human to interpret, subjective when they are interpretable, and difficult to quantify in terms of inversion quality. Additionally, scaling the DT&E process is challenging due to many ML model architectures and data modalities that need to be assessed. In this work, we present a novel DT&E tool that quantifies the risk of data privacy loss from MIAs and introduces four adversarial risk dimensions to quantify privacy loss. Our DT&E pipeline combines inversion with vision language models (VLMs) to improve effectiveness while enabling scalable analysis. We demonstrate effectiveness using multiple MIA techniques and VLMs configured for zero-shot classification and image captioning. We benchmark the pipeline using several state-of-the-art MIAs in the computer vision domain with an image classification task that is typical in military applications. In general, our innovative pipeline extends the current model inversion DT&E capabilities by improving the effectiveness and scalability of the privacy loss analysis in an automated fashion.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPECS: Specificity-Enhanced CLIP-Score for Long Image Caption Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03897v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity (RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments, but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development. We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/SPECS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models through Aligning Attention Distribution to Information Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14257v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the unidirectional masking mechanism, Decoder-Only models propagate information from left to right. LVLMs (Large Vision-Language Models) follow the same architecture, with visual information gradually integrated into semantic representations during forward propagation. Through systematic analysis, we observe that the majority of the visual information is absorbed into the semantic representations. However, the model's attention distribution does not exhibit sufficient emphasis on semantic representations. This misalignment between the attention distribution and the actual information flow undermines the model's visual understanding ability and contributes to hallucinations. To address this issue, we enhance the model's visual understanding by leveraging the core information embedded in semantic representations. Specifically, we identify attention heads that focus on core semantic representations based on their attention distributions. Then, through a two-stage optimization paradigm, we propagate the advantages of these attention heads across the entire model, aligning the attention distribution with the actual information flow. We evaluate our method on three image captioning benchmarks using five different LVLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly reducing hallucinations. Further experiments reveal a trade-off between reduced hallucinations and richer details. Notably, our method allows for manual adjustment of the model's conservativeness, enabling flexible control to meet diverse real-world requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich, factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2 embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1 dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set.

Conventional vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search, Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Currently, precise descriptions are typically limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels, capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions with varying levels of detail.

| **[Activation Steering Meets Preference Optimization: Defense Against Jailbreaks in Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00373v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM (\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research. \textcolor{red}{Warning: This paper may contain examples of offensive or harmful text and images.}</p></details> |  |
| **[One More Glance with Sharp Eyes: Rethinking Lightweight Captioning as a Practical Visual Specialist](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21451v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications. While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes, where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/junha/lightweightcaptioner</p></details> |

MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient, scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe 2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary teachers using distributed scalable processing.</p></details> | TMLR August 2025 |
| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Object-aware Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20181v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options (i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.</p></details> | BMVC 2025 |

This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs via post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipeline, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs. The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong closed-source models in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training Pipeline: Unlike general MLLMs that typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm, we find that a single-stage approach is more effective for domain adaptation. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks.

However, these models struggle with compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition" directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found https://github.com/Mystic-Slice/Do-VLMs-Have-Bad-Eyes.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Explainable Computer Vision: Quo Vadis? workshop at ICCV'25</p></details> |

Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems, considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.</p></details> | Peer-reviewed |
| **[AgentArmor: Enforcing Program Analysis on Agent Runtime Trace to Defend Against Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01249v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's runtime traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools \& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis for sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can reduce the ASR to 3\%, with the utility drop only 1\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[A functional tensor model for dynamic multilayer networks with common invariant subspaces and the RKHS estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05221v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic multilayer networks are frequently used to describe the structure and temporal evolution of multiple relationships among common entities, with applications in fields such as sociology, economics, and neuroscience. However, exploration of analytical methods for these complex data structures remains limited. We propose a functional tensor-based model for dynamic multilayer networks, with the key feature of capturing the shared structure among common vertices across all layers, while simultaneously accommodating smoothly varying temporal dynamics and layer-specific heterogeneity. The proposed model and its embeddings can be applied to various downstream network inference tasks, including dimensionality reduction, vertex community detection, analysis of network evolution periodicity, visualization of dynamic network evolution patterns, and evaluation of inter-layer similarity. We provide an estimation algorithm based on functional tensor Tucker decomposition and the reproducing kernel Hilbert space framework, with an effective initialization strategy to improve computational efficiency. The estimation procedure can be extended to address more generalized functional tensor problems, as well as to handle missing data or unaligned observations. We validate our method on simulated data and two real-world cases: the dynamic Citi Bike trip network and an international food trade dynamic multilayer network, with each layer corresponding to a different product.</p></details> |  |
| **[BEDTime: A Unified Benchmark for Automatically Describing Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05215v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1) recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1) popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected, identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we describe the different abstractions used by PyRAT to find the reachable states of a neural network starting from its input as well as the main features of the tool to provide fast and accurate analysis of neural networks.

Trained on a diverse set of datasets of initial and boundary conditions paired with corresponding solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), ICON learns to map example condition-solution pairs of a given differential equation to an approximation of its solution operator. Here, we present a probabilistic framework that reveals ICON as implicitly performing Bayesian inference, where it computes the mean of the posterior predictive distribution over solution operators conditioned on the provided context, i.e., example condition-solution pairs. The formalism of random differential equations provides the probabilistic framework for describing the tasks ICON accomplishes while also providing a basis for understanding other multi-operator learning methods. This probabilistic perspective provides a basis for extending ICON to \emph{generative} settings, where one can sample from the posterior predictive distribution of solution operators. The generative formulation of ICON (GenICON) captures the underlying uncertainty in the solution operator, which enables principled uncertainty quantification in the solution predictions in operator learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

The nonlinear interconnected system is characterized by saturated nonlinearities that describe how agents transmit their opinion state to their neighbors in the hypernetwork, and by a bifurcation parameter representing the community's social effort. We show that the presence of higher-order interactions leads to the unfolding of a pitchfork bifurcation, introducing an interval for the social effort parameter in which the system exhibits bistability. With equilibrium points representing collective decisions, this implies that, depending on the initial conditions, the community will either remain in a deadlock state (with the origin as the equilibrium point) or reach a nontrivial decision. A numerical example is given to illustrate the results.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

Training FKGE models with higher dimensions is typically favored due to their potential for achieving superior performance. However, high-dimensional embeddings present significant challenges in terms of storage resource and inference speed. Unlike traditional KG embedding methods, FKGE involves multiple client-server communication rounds, where communication efficiency is critical. Existing embedding compression methods for traditional KGs may not be directly applicable to FKGE as they often require multiple model trainings which potentially incur substantial communication costs. In this paper, we propose a light-weight component based on Knowledge Distillation (KD) which is titled FedKD and tailored specifically for FKGE methods. During client-side local training, FedKD facilitates the low-dimensional student model to mimic the score distribution of triples from the high-dimensional teacher model using KL divergence loss. Unlike traditional KD way, FedKD adaptively learns a temperature to scale the score of positive triples and separately adjusts the scores of corresponding negative triples using a predefined temperature, thereby mitigating teacher over-confidence issue. Furthermore, we dynamically adjust the weight of KD loss to optimize the training process. Extensive experiments on three datasets support the effectiveness of FedKD.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPU Acceleration of SQL Analytics on Compressed Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10092v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPUs are uniquely suited to accelerate (SQL) analytics workloads thanks to their massive compute parallelism and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) -- when datasets fit in the GPU HBM, performance is unparalleled. Unfortunately, GPU HBMs remain typically small when compared with lower-bandwidth CPU main memory. Besides brute-force scaling across many GPUs, current solutions to accelerate queries on large datasets include leveraging data partitioning and loading smaller data batches in GPU HBM, and hybrid execution with a connected device (e.g., CPUs). Unfortunately, these approaches are exposed to the limitations of lower main memory and host-to-device interconnect bandwidths, introduce additional I/O overheads, or incur higher costs. This is a substantial problem when trying to scale adoption of GPUs on larger datasets. Data compression can alleviate this bottleneck, but to avoid paying for costly decompression/decoding, an ideal solution must include computation primitives to operate directly on data in compressed form. This is the focus of our paper: a set of new methods for running queries directly on light-weight compressed data using schemes such as Run-Length Encoding (RLE), index encoding, bit-width reductions, and dictionary encoding. Our novelty includes operating on multiple RLE columns without decompression, handling heterogeneous column encodings, and leveraging PyTorch tensor operations for portability across devices. Experimental evaluations show speedups of an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art commercial CPU-only analytics systems, for real-world queries on a production dataset that would not fit into GPU memory uncompressed. This work paves the road for GPU adoption in a much broader set of use cases, and it is complementary to most other scale-out or fallback mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration, resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner, allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE). Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task, called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in fidelity and consistency.</p></details> |  |

The cache is implemented as a fully-fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multi-resolution hash-grid encoding, enabling online training and efficient inference on modern GPUs in real-time frame rates. The cache can be seamlessly integrated into existing rendering frameworks and can be used in combination with other real-time techniques such as spatiotemporal reservoir sampling (ReSTIR).</p></details> |  |

| **[An LLM-powered Natural-to-Robotic Language Translation Framework with Correctness Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19074v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being deployed in robotics to generate robot control programs for specific user tasks, enabling embodied intelligence. Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt design that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user tasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and the high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to tremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly undermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied. This paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i) provides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii) enhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based fine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is proposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs, bridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the RSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by the LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until being verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the LLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications. Experiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range of LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Routing of Text-to-Image Generation Requests Between Large Cloud Model and Light-Weight Edge Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13787v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large text-to-image models demonstrate impressive generation capabilities; however, their substantial size necessitates expensive cloud servers for deployment. Conversely, light-weight models can be deployed on edge devices at lower cost but often with inferior generation quality for complex user prompts. To strike a balance between performance and cost, we propose a routing framework, called RouteT2I, which dynamically selects either the large cloud model or the light-weight edge model for each user prompt. Since generated image quality is challenging to measure and compare directly, RouteT2I establishes multi-dimensional quality metrics, particularly, by evaluating the similarity between the generated images and both positive and negative texts that describe each specific quality metric. RouteT2I then predicts the expected quality of the generated images by identifying key tokens in the prompt and comparing their impact on the quality. RouteT2I further introduces the Pareto relative superiority to compare the multi-metric quality of the generated images. Based on this comparison and predefined cost constraints, RouteT2I allocates prompts to either the edge or the cloud. Evaluation reveals that RouteT2I significantly reduces the number of requesting large cloud model while maintaining high-quality image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators (FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion) parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training.

| **[Unlocking the Potential of MLLMs in Referring Expression Segmentation via a Light-weight Mask Decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04107v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding, their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction. Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost.

However, current works treat different tools as isolated components and fail to leverage the inherent dependencies of tools, leading to invalid planning results. Since tool dependencies are often incomplete, it becomes challenging for LLMs to accurately identify the appropriate tools required by a user request, especially when confronted with a large toolset. To solve this challenge, we propose \texttt{GTool}, which is the first work aiming to enhance the tool planning ability of LLMs under incomplete dependencies. \texttt{GTool} constructs a request-specific tool graph to select tools efficiently and generate the \texttt{<graph token>} which provides sufficient dependency information understandable by LLMs. Moreover, a missing dependency prediction task is designed to improve the reliability of \texttt{GTool} with incomplete dependencies. Without trimming LLMs, \texttt{GTool} can be seamlessly integrated with various LLM backbones without extensive retraining. Extensive experiments show that \texttt{GTool} achieves more than 29.6\% performance improvements compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines with a light-weight (7B) LLM backbone.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

This criterion assigns a distinct weight to each excursion set point based on the associated field. We apply the cmd-$n$ on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to identify the cosmic string networks (CSs) through their unique Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins effect on the temperature anisotropies. We also formulate the perturbative expansion of cmd-$n$ for the weak non-Gaussian regime up to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma_0^3)$. We propose a comprehensive pipeline designed to analyze the morphological properties of string-induced CMB maps within the flat sky approximation. To evaluate the robustness of our proposed criteria, we employ string-induced high-resolution flat-sky CMB simulated patches of $7.2$ deg$^2$ size with a resolution of $0.42$ arc-minutes. Our results demonstrate that the minimum detectable value of cosmic string tension is $G\mu\gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-7}$ when a noise-free map is analyzed with normalized cmd-$n$. Whereas for the ACT, CMB-S4, and Planck-like experiments at 95.45\% confidence level, the normalized cmd-$n$ can distinguish the CSs network for $G\mu\gtrsim2.9 \times 10^{-7}$, $G\mu\gtrsim 2.4\times 10^{-7}$ and $G\mu\gtrsim 5.8\times 10^{-7}$, respectively. The normalized cmd-$n$ exhibits a significantly enhanced capability in detecting CSs relative to the Minkowski Functionals.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures and 3 tables, comments are welcome, V2: added some references, V3: matched to the published version</p></details> |
| **[ForensicsSAM: Toward Robust and Unified Image Forgery Detection and Localization Resisting to Adversarial Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07402v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular strategy for adapting large vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and LLaVA, to downstream tasks like image forgery detection and localization (IFDL). However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model, without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization.

| **[Transferable Model-agnostic Vision-Language Model Adaptation for Efficient Weak-to-Strong Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08604v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance 'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained, this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain, often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual recognition tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, there remains a fundamental disconnect between the probabilistic 5G delay characteristics and the often idealistic delay models used to synthesize 5G-TSN network configurations. For time-driven schedules in particular, any delay outlier unforeseen during schedule synthesis can jeopardize the robustness of their real-time guarantees. To address this challenge, we present the (m,k)-firm Elevation Policy to uphold a base level of weakly hard real-time guarantees during unstable network conditions that do not match the expected delay characteristics. It augments the primary time-driven schedule with a dynamic priority-driven scheme to elevate the priority of m out of k consecutive frames if they are delayed. Our evaluations demonstrate that weakly hard real-time guarantees are essential to uphold the quality of control within a networked control system. At the same time, only a small overhead is imposed when the primary schedule can provide stronger quality of service guarantees. Our (m,k)-firm Elevation Policy thereby yields a robust but light-weight fallback mechanism to serve applications with meaningful guarantees during unstable network conditions.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |

This requires the redevelopment of the model when applying it to a new BCI paradigm, resulting in repeated costs and effort. Moreover, less complex deep learning models are desired for practical usage, as well as for deployment on portable devices. In or-der to fill the above gaps, we, in this study, proposed a light-weight and unified decoding model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification. The proposed model starts with a tempo-spatial convolution. It is followed by a multi-scale local feature selec-tion module, aiming to extract local features shared across BCI paradigms and generate weighted features. Finally, a mul-ti-dimensional global feature extraction module is designed, in which multi-dimensional global features are extracted from the weighted features and fused with the weighted features to form high-level feature representations associated with BCI para-digms. The results, evaluated on a mixture of three classical BCI paradigms (i.e., MI, SSVEP, and P300), demon-strate that the proposed model achieves 88.39%, 82.36%, 80.01%, and 0.8092 for accuracy, macro-precision, mac-ro-recall, and macro-F1-score, respectively, significantly out-performing the compared models. This study pro-vides a feasible solution for cross-BCI-paradigm classifica-tion. It lays a technological foundation for de-veloping a new generation of unified decoding systems, paving the way for low-cost and universal practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Automatically notifying users whether their queries leak privacy and which phrases leak what private information has therefore become a practical need. Existing privacy detection methods, however, were designed for different objectives and application domains, typically tagging personally identifiable information (PII) in anonymous content, which is insufficient in real-name interaction scenarios with LLMs. In this work, to support the development and evaluation of privacy detection models for LLM interactions that are deployable on local user devices, we construct a large-scale multilingual dataset with 249K user queries and 154K annotated privacy phrases. In particular, we build an automated privacy annotation pipeline with strong LLMs to automatically extract privacy phrases from dialogue datasets and annotate leaked information. We also design evaluation metrics at the levels of privacy leakage, extracted privacy phrase, and privacy information. We further establish baseline methods using light-weight LLMs with both tuning-free and tuning-based methods, and report a comprehensive evaluation of their performance. Evaluation results reveal a gap between current performance and the requirements of real-world LLM applications, motivating future research into more effective local privacy detection methods grounded in our dataset.</p></details> | 8 content pages |

While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2025)</p></details> |

Soft-TF sequentially learns and selects an optimal soft-network for each task. During sequential training in CL, a well-initialized Soft-TF mask optimizes the weights of sparse layers to obtain task-adaptive soft (real-valued) networks, while keeping the well-pre-trained layer parameters frozen. In inference, the identified task-adaptive network of Soft-TF masks the parameters of the pre-trained network, mapping to an optimal solution for each task and minimizing Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) - the soft-masking preserves the knowledge of the pre-trained network. Extensive experiments on the Vision Transformer (ViT) and the Language Transformer (Bert) demonstrate the effectiveness of Soft-TF, achieving state-of-the-art performance across Vision and Language Class Incremental Learning (CIL) scenarios.</p></details> |  |

By abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process, and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework (LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates, while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in multi-step scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes. However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels (ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD) methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure its computational complexity to validate its suitability for resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by more than 5% in final accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[Class Incremental Continual Learning with Self-Organizing Maps and Variational Autoencoders Using Synthetic Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21240v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual learning.</p></details> |  |

Recently, replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this, exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge representations. To this end, we propose to fuse information from sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr$^2$R). More specifically, by distilling the training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the fused samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving data privacy. Specifically, Pr$^2$R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other replay-based methods, respectively.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Inspired by memory consolidation in the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space, potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Memory Learning: Imitating Lifelong Remembering and Forgetting of Brain Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19183v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data in real-world scenarios undergo rapid and frequent changes, making it challenging for existing graph models to effectively handle the continuous influx of new data and accommodate data withdrawal requests. The approach to frequently retraining graph models is resource intensive and impractical. To address this pressing challenge, this paper introduces a new concept of graph memory learning. Its core idea is to enable a graph model to selectively remember new knowledge but forget old knowledge. Building on this approach, the paper presents a novel graph memory learning framework - Brain-inspired Graph Memory Learning (BGML), inspired by brain network dynamics and function-structure coupling strategies. BGML incorporates a multi-granular hierarchical progressive learning mechanism rooted in feature graph grain learning to mitigate potential conflict between memorization and forgetting in graph memory learning. This mechanism allows for a comprehensive and multi-level perception of local details within evolving graphs. In addition, to tackle the issue of unreliable structures in newly added incremental information, the paper introduces an information self-assessment ownership mechanism. This mechanism not only facilitates the propagation of incremental information within the model but also effectively preserves the integrity of past experiences. We design five types of graph memory learning tasks: regular, memory, unlearning, data-incremental, and class-incremental to evaluate BGML. Its excellent performance is confirmed through extensive experiments on multiple real-world node classification datasets.</p></details> |  |

CIR assumes that we can easily access abundant unlabeled data from external sources, such as the Internet. Therefore, we propose two components that efficiently use the unlabeled data to ensure the high stability and the plasticity of models trained in CIR setup. First, we introduce multi-level knowledge distillation (MLKD) that distills knowledge from multiple previous models across multiple perspectives, including features and logits, so the model can maintain much various previous knowledge. Moreover, we implement dynamic self-supervised loss (SSL) to utilize the unlabeled data that accelerates the learning of new classes, while dynamic weighting of SSL keeps the focus of training to the primary task. Both of our proposed components significantly improve the performance in CIR setup, achieving 2nd place in the CVPR 5th CLVISION Challenge.</p></details> |  |

Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total of 14 datasets.

Existing methods either freeze the backbone to prevent catastrophic forgetting, sacrificing plasticity, or add new modules, incurring high costs. These approaches treat pretrained models as black boxes, overlooking two key opportunities to exploit their internal capacity: reusing redundant representational space within layers and selectively adapting layers based on their sensitivity to forgetting. We propose CKPD-FSCIL, a unified framework that unlocks the underutilized capacity of pretrained weights, achieving a superior stability-plasticity balance with zero inference overhead. Our design integrates two continuously adapting mechanisms: At the weight level, a Continuous Knowledge-Preserving Decomposition mechanism uses feature covariance to split each weight matrix into a frozen subspace that safeguards prior knowledge and a learnable, redundant subspace for new tasks. At the layer level, a Continuous Adaptive Layer Selection mechanism leverages an Adapter Sensitivity Ratio to automatically select layers with the highest redundant capacity and lowest forgetting risk for adaptation. By targeting only safe, high-potential subspaces and layers, CKPD-FSCIL enables efficient adaptation. After each session, the learned adapters are merged back into the original weights, ensuring zero additional parameters or FLOPs during inference. Extensive experiments on multiple FSCIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both adaptability and knowledge retention.

Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas, improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery, and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual Learning for Multimodal Data Fusion of a Soft Gripper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13792v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) refers to the ability of an algorithm to continuously and incrementally acquire new knowledge from its environment while retaining previously learned information. A model trained on one data modality often fails when tested with a different modality. A straightforward approach might be to fuse the two modalities by concatenating their features and training the model on the fused data. However, this requires retraining the model from scratch each time it encounters a new domain. In this paper, we introduce a continual learning algorithm capable of incrementally learning different data modalities by leveraging both class-incremental and domain-incremental learning scenarios in an artificial environment where labeled data is scarce, yet non-iid (independent and identical distribution) unlabeled data from the environment is plentiful. The proposed algorithm is efficient and only requires storing prototypes for each class. We evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness on a challenging custom multimodal dataset comprising of tactile data from a soft pneumatic gripper, and visual data from non-stationary images of objects extracted from video sequences. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study on the custom dataset and the Core50 dataset to highlight the contributions of different components of the algorithm. To further demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, we perform a real-time experiment for object classification using the soft gripper and an external independent camera setup, all synchronized with the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Wiley Advanced Robotics Research</p></details> |
| **[MEGA: Second-Order Gradient Alignment for Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation in GFSCIL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13691v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (GFSCIL) enables models to continually learn from limited samples of novel tasks after initial training on a large base dataset. Existing GFSCIL approaches typically utilize Prototypical Networks (PNs) for metric-based class representations and fine-tune the model during the incremental learning stage. However, these PN-based methods oversimplify learning via novel query set fine-tuning and fail to integrate Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques due to architectural constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a more rigorous and practical setting for GFSCIL that excludes query sets during the incremental training phase. Building on this foundation, we introduce Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning (MEGA), aimed at effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting for GFSCIL. Specifically, by calculating the incremental second-order gradient during the meta-training stage, we endow the model to learn high-quality priors that enhance incremental learning by aligning its behaviors across both the meta-training and incremental learning stages. Extensive experiments on four mainstream graph datasets demonstrate that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art results and enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in GFSCIL. We believe that our proposed MEGA serves as a model-agnostic GFSCIL paradigm, paving the way for future research.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[SEDEG:Sequential Enhancement of Decoder and Encoder's Generality for Class Incremental Learning with Small Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12932v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In incremental learning, enhancing the generality of knowledge is crucial for adapting to dynamic data inputs. It can develop generalized representations or more balanced decision boundaries, preventing the degradation of long-term knowledge over time and thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Some emerging incremental learning methods adopt an encoder-decoder architecture and have achieved promising results. In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the generalization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it helps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and robustness to new, diverse data inputs. However, many existing continual methods focus solely on enhancing one of the two components, which limits their effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. And these methods perform even worse in small-memory scenarios, where only a limited number of historical samples can be stored. To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a two-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on sequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially, SEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized representations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and balance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation (KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more generalized encoder. This involves using a balanced KD approach and feature KD for effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show SEDEG's superior performance, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of its components.

| **[Does Prior Data Matter? Exploring Joint Training in the Context of Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10003v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to adapt to continuously emerging new classes while preserving knowledge of previously learned ones. Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) presents a greater challenge that requires the model to learn new classes from only a limited number of samples per class. While incremental learning typically assumes restricted access to past data, it often remains available in many real-world scenarios. This raises a practical question: should one retrain the model on the full dataset (i.e., joint training), or continue updating it solely with new data? In CIL, joint training is considered an ideal benchmark that provides a reference for evaluating the trade-offs between performance and computational cost. However, in FSCIL, joint training becomes less reliable due to severe imbalance between base and incremental classes. This results in the absence of a practical baseline, making it unclear which strategy is preferable for practitioners. To this end, we revisit joint training in the context of FSCIL by incorporating imbalance mitigation techniques, and suggest a new imbalance-aware joint training benchmark for FSCIL. We then conduct extensive comparisons between this benchmark and FSCIL methods to analyze which approach is most suitable when prior data is accessible. Our analysis offers realistic insights and guidance for selecting training strategies in real-world FSCIL scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/shiwonkim/Joint_FSCIL</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-shot Class-incremental Fault Diagnosis by Preserving Class-Agnostic Knowledge with Dual-Granularity Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16634v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Fault Diagnosis (FSC-FD), which aims to continuously learn from new fault classes with only a few samples without forgetting old ones, is critical for real-world industrial systems. However, this challenging task severely amplifies the issues of catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity Representations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN explicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a fine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order Interaction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific features from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation stream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared across all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a multi-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained knowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting and alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy. Moreover, a decoupled Balanced Random Forest classifier is employed to counter the decision boundary bias caused by data imbalance. Extensive experiments on the TEP benchmark and a real-world MFF dataset demonstrate that our proposed DGGN achieves superior diagnostic performance and stability compared to state-of-the-art FSC-FD approaches.

| **[ESSENTIAL: Episodic and Semantic Memory Integration for Video Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10896v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning (VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 ICCV Highlight paper, 17 pages including supplementary material</p></details> |
