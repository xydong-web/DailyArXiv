| **[LLMs Outperform Experts on Challenging Biology Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06108v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study systematically evaluates 27 frontier Large Language Models on eight diverse biology benchmarks spanning molecular biology, genetics, cloning, virology, and biosecurity. Models from major AI developers released between November 2022 and April 2025 were assessed through ten independent runs per benchmark. The findings reveal dramatic improvements in biological capabilities. Top model performance increased more than 4-fold on the challenging text-only subset of the Virology Capabilities Test over the study period, with the top model now performing twice as well as expert virologists. Several models now match or exceed expert-level performance on other challenging benchmarks, including LAB-Bench CloningScenarios and the biology subsets of GPQA and WMDP. Contrary to expectations, chain-of-thought did not substantially improve performance over zero-shot evaluation, while extended reasoning features in o3-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet typically improved performance as predicted by inference scaling. Benchmarks such as PubMedQA and the MMLU and WMDP biology subsets exhibited performance plateaus well below 100%, suggesting benchmark saturation and errors in the underlying benchmark data. The analysis highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation methodologies as AI systems continue to advance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter Invariance Analysis of Moment Equations Using Dulmage-Mendelsohn Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13336v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Living organisms maintain stable functioning amid environmental fluctuations through homeostasis, a property that preserves a system's behavior despite changes in environmental conditions. To elucidate homeostasis in stochastic biochemical reactions, theoretical tools for assessing population-level invariance under parameter perturbations are crucial. In this paper, we propose a systematic method for identifying the stationary moments that remain invariant under parameter perturbations by leveraging the structural properties of the stationary moment equations. A key step in this development is addressing the underdetermined nature of moment equations, which has traditionally made it difficult to characterize how stationary moments depend on system parameters. To overcome this, we utilize the Dulmage-Mendelsohn (DM) decomposition of the coefficient matrix to extract welldetermined subequations and reveal their hierarchical structure. Leveraging this structure, we identify stationary moments whose partial derivatives with respect to parameters are structurally zero, facilitating the exploration of fundamental constraints that govern homeostatic behavior in stochastic biochemical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal Molecular Representation Learning via Structure Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05877v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate extraction of molecular representations is a critical step in the drug discovery process. In recent years, significant progress has been made in molecular representation learning methods, among which multi-modal molecular representation methods based on images, and 2D/3D topologies have become increasingly mainstream. However, existing these multi-modal approaches often directly fuse information from different modalities, overlooking the potential of intermodal interactions and failing to adequately capture the complex higher-order relationships and invariant features between molecules. To overcome these challenges, we propose a structure-awareness-based multi-modal self-supervised molecular representation pre-training framework (MMSA) designed to enhance molecular graph representations by leveraging invariant knowledge between molecules. The framework consists of two main modules: the multi-modal molecular representation learning module and the structure-awareness module. The multi-modal molecular representation learning module collaboratively processes information from different modalities of the same molecule to overcome intermodal differences and generate a unified molecular embedding. Subsequently, the structure-awareness module enhances the molecular representation by constructing a hypergraph structure to model higher-order correlations between molecules. This module also introduces a memory mechanism for storing typical molecular representations, aligning them with memory anchors in the memory bank to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the model generalization ability. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of MMSA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MoleculeNet benchmark, with average ROC-AUC improvements ranging from 1.8% to 9.6% over baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP) 2025</p></details> |
| **[A 3D pocket-aware and evolutionary conserved interaction guided diffusion model for molecular optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05874v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating molecules that bind to specific protein targets via diffusion models has shown good promise for structure-based drug design and molecule optimization. Especially, the diffusion models with binding interaction guidance enables molecule generation with high affinity through forming favorable interaction within protein pocket. However, the generated molecules may not form interactions with the highly conserved residues, which are important for protein functions and bioactivities of the ligands. Herein, we developed a new 3D target-aware diffusion model DiffDecip, which explicitly incorporates the protein-ligand binding interactions and evolutionary conservation information of protein residues into both diffusion and sampling process, for molecule optimization through scaffold decoration. The model performance revealed that DiffDecip outperforms baseline model DiffDec on molecule optimization towards higher affinity through forming more non-covalent interactions with highly conserved residues in the protein pocket.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unfitted finite element modelling of surface-bulk viscous flows in animal cells](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05723v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel unfitted finite element framework to simulate coupled surface-bulk problems in time-dependent domains, focusing on fluid-fluid interactions in animal cells between the actomyosin cortex and the cytoplasm. The cortex, a thin layer beneath the plasma membrane, provides structural integrity and drives shape changes by generating surface contractile forces akin to tension. Cortical contractions generate Marangoni-like surface flows and induce intracellular cytoplasmic flows that are essential for processes such as cell division, migration, and polarization, particularly in large animal cells. Despite its importance, the spatiotemporal regulation of cortex-cytoplasm interactions remains poorly understood and computational modelling can be very challenging because surface-bulk dynamics often lead to large cell deformations. To address these challenges, we propose a sharp-interface framework that uniquely combines the trace finite element method for surface flows with the aggregated finite element method for bulk flows. This approach enables accurate and stable simulations on fixed Cartesian grids without remeshing. The model also incorporates mechanochemical feedback through the surface transport of a molecular regulator of active tension. We solve the resulting mixed-dimensional system on a fixed Cartesian grid using a level-set-based method to track the evolving surface. Numerical experiments validate the accuracy and stability of the method, capturing phenomena such as self-organised pattern formation, curvature-driven relaxation, and cell cleavage. This novel framework offers a powerful and extendable tool for investigating increasingly complex morphogenetic processes in animal cells.</p></details> | 29 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Design of a molecular Field Effect Transistor (mFET)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05693v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Field Effect Transistors (FETs) are ubiquitous in electronics. As we scale FETs to ever smaller sizes, it becomes natural to ask how small a practical FET might be. We propose and analyze an atomically precise molecular FET (herein referred to as an "mFET") with 7,694 atoms made only of hydrogen and carbon atoms. It uses metallic (4,4) carbon nanotubes as the conductive leads, a linear segment of Lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond) as the channel, Lonsdaleite as the insulating layer between the channel and the gate, and a (20,20) metallic carbon nanotube as the surrounding gate. The (4,4) nanotube leads are bonded to the channel using a mix of 5- and 6-membered rings, and to the gate using 5-, 6- and 7-membered rings. Issues of component design assessment and optimization using quantum chemical methods are discussed throughout. A 10 watt sugar-cube-sized computer made with $10^{18}$ such mFETs could deliver $\sim 10^{25}$ switching operations per second.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |

| **[Enhancing Chemical Reaction and Retrosynthesis Prediction with Large Language Model and Dual-task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02639v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical reaction and retrosynthesis prediction are fundamental tasks in drug discovery. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in many domains. However, directly applying LLMs to these tasks faces two major challenges: (i) lacking a large-scale chemical synthesis-related instruction dataset; (ii) ignoring the close correlation between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction for the existing fine-tuning strategies. To address these challenges, we propose ChemDual, a novel LLM framework for accurate chemical synthesis. Specifically, considering the high cost of data acquisition for reaction and retrosynthesis, ChemDual regards the reaction-and-retrosynthesis of molecules as a related recombination-and-fragmentation process and constructs a large-scale of 4.4 million instruction dataset. Furthermore, ChemDual introduces an enhanced LLaMA, equipped with a multi-scale tokenizer and dual-task learning strategy, to jointly optimize the process of recombination and fragmentation as well as the tasks between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction. Extensive experiments on Mol-Instruction and USPTO-50K datasets demonstrate that ChemDual achieves state-of-the-art performance in both predictions of reaction and retrosynthesis, outperforming the existing conventional single-task approaches and the general open-source LLMs. Through molecular docking analysis, ChemDual generates compounds with diverse and strong protein binding affinity, further highlighting its strong potential in drug design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fragment-Masked Molecular Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09106v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, aimed at refining molecular structures to enhance drug efficacy and minimize side effects, ultimately accelerating the overall drug development process. Many target-based molecular optimization methods have been proposed, significantly advancing drug discovery. These methods primarily on understanding the specific drug target structures or their hypothesized roles in combating diseases. However, challenges such as a limited number of available targets and a difficulty capturing clear structures hinder innovative drug development. In contrast, phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) does not depend on clear target structures and can identify hits with novel and unbiased polypharmacology signatures. As a result, PDD-based molecular optimization can reduce potential safety risks while optimizing phenotypic activity, thereby increasing the likelihood of clinical success. Therefore, we propose a fragment-masked molecular optimization method based on PDD (FMOP). FMOP employs a regression-free diffusion model to conditionally optimize the molecular masked regions without training, effectively generating new molecules with similar scaffolds. On the large-scale drug response dataset GDSCv2, we optimize the potential molecules across all 945 cell lines. The overall experiments demonstrate that the in-silico optimization success rate reaches 94.4%, with an average efficacy increase of 5.3%. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation and visualization experiments, confirming that FMOP is an effective and robust molecular optimization method. The code is available at:https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FMOP-98C2.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Pretraining Generative Flow Networks with Inexpensive Rewards for Molecular Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06337v3)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have recently emerged as a suitable framework for generating diverse and high-quality molecular structures by learning from rewards treated as unnormalized distributions. Previous works in this framework often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on a subset of ZINC dataset, and by employing robust evaluation metrics we show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods for a wide range of drug design tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.09702</p></details> |
| **[GEOM-Drugs Revisited: Toward More Chemically Accurate Benchmarks for 3D Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00169v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models have shown significant promise in generating valid 3D molecular structures, with the GEOM-Drugs dataset serving as a key benchmark. However, current evaluation protocols suffer from critical flaws, including incorrect valency definitions, bugs in bond order calculations, and reliance on force fields inconsistent with the reference data. In this work, we revisit GEOM-Drugs and propose a corrected evaluation framework: we identify and fix issues in data preprocessing, construct chemically accurate valency tables, and introduce a GFN2-xTB-based geometry and energy benchmark. We retrain and re-evaluate several leading models under this framework, providing updated performance metrics and practical recommendations for future benchmarking. Our results underscore the need for chemically rigorous evaluation practices in 3D molecular generation.

| **[MADGEN: Mass-Spec attends to De Novo Molecular generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01950v4)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The annotation (assigning structural chemical identities) of MS/MS spectra remains a significant challenge due to the enormous molecular diversity in biological samples and the limited scope of reference databases. Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the "dark chemical space" without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[JTreeformer: Graph-Transformer via Latent-Diffusion Model for Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20770v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of new molecules based on the original chemical molecule distributions is of great importance in medicine. The graph transformer, with its advantages of high performance and scalability compared to traditional graph networks, has been widely explored in recent research for applications of graph structures. However, current transformer-based graph decoders struggle to effectively utilize graph information, which limits their capacity to leverage only sequences of nodes rather than the complex topological structures of molecule graphs. This paper focuses on building a graph transformer-based framework for molecular generation, which we call \textbf{JTreeformer} as it transforms graph generation into junction tree generation. It combines GCN parallel with multi-head attention as the encoder. It integrates a directed acyclic GCN into a graph-based Transformer to serve as a decoder, which can iteratively synthesize the entire molecule by leveraging information from the partially constructed molecular structure at each step. In addition, a diffusion model is inserted in the latent space generated by the encoder, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of sampling further. The empirical results demonstrate that our novel framework outperforms existing molecule generation methods, thus offering a promising tool to advance drug discovery (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/JTreeformer-C74C).</p></details> | 9 pages, 6figures |

We mitigate this problem with a novel scheme that regulates the aggregation of messages, modulating the type and extent of message passing locally thereby preserving both the low and high-frequency components of information. Our approach relies solely on learnt embeddings, obviating the need for auxiliary labels, thus extending the benefits of heterophily-aware embeddings to broader applications, e.g., generative modelling. Our experiments, conducted across various data sets and GNN architectures, demonstrate performance enhancements and reveal heterophily patterns across standard classification benchmarks. Furthermore, application to molecular generation showcases notable performance improvements on chemoinformatics benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appearing in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improved Molecular Generation through Attribute-Driven Integrative Embeddings and GAN Selectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19040v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for molecules with tailored properties in fields such as drug discovery and chemical engineering has driven advancements in computational methods for molecular design. Machine learning-based approaches for de-novo molecular generation have recently garnered significant attention. This paper introduces a transformer-based vector embedding generator combined with a modified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate molecules with desired properties. The embedding generator utilizes a novel molecular descriptor, integrating Morgan fingerprints with global molecular attributes, enabling the transformer to capture local functional groups and broader molecular characteristics. Modifying the GAN generator loss function ensures the generation of molecules with specific desired properties. The transformer achieves a reconversion accuracy of 94% while translating molecular descriptors back to SMILES strings, validating the utility of the proposed embeddings for generative tasks. The approach is validated by generating novel odorant molecules using a labeled dataset of odorant and non-odorant compounds. With the modified range-loss function, the GAN exclusively generates odorant molecules. This work underscores the potential of combining novel vector embeddings with transformers and modified GAN architectures to accelerate the discovery of tailored molecules, offering a robust tool for diverse molecular design applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clifford Group Equivariant Diffusion Models for 3D Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15773v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores leveraging the Clifford algebra's expressive power for $\E(n)$-equivariant diffusion models. We utilize the geometric products between Clifford multivectors and the rich geometric information encoded in Clifford subspaces in \emph{Clifford Diffusion Models} (CDMs). We extend the diffusion process beyond just Clifford one-vectors to incorporate all higher-grade multivector subspaces. The data is embedded in grade-$k$ subspaces, allowing us to apply latent diffusion across complete multivectors. This enables CDMs to capture the joint distribution across different subspaces of the algebra, incorporating richer geometric information through higher-order features. We provide empirical results for unconditional molecular generation on the QM9 dataset, showing that CDMs provide a promising avenue for generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[MetaMolGen: A Neural Graph Motif Generation Model for De Novo Molecular Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15587v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular generation plays an important role in drug discovery and materials science, especially in data-scarce scenarios where traditional generative models often struggle to achieve satisfactory conditional generalization. To address this challenge, we propose MetaMolGen, a first-order meta-learning-based molecular generator designed for few-shot and property-conditioned molecular generation. MetaMolGen standardizes the distribution of graph motifs by mapping them to a normalized latent space, and employs a lightweight autoregressive sequence model to generate SMILES sequences that faithfully reflect the underlying molecular structure. In addition, it supports conditional generation of molecules with target properties through a learnable property projector integrated into the generative process.Experimental results demonstrate that MetaMolGen consistently generates valid and diverse SMILES sequences under low-data regimes, outperforming conventional baselines. This highlights its advantage in fast adaptation and efficient conditional generation for practical molecular design.</p></details> |  |

| **[Higher-Order Graphon Neural Networks: Approximation and Cut Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14338v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph limit models, like graphons for limits of dense graphs, have recently been used to study size transferability of graph neural networks (GNNs). While most literature focuses on message passing GNNs (MPNNs), in this work we attend to the more powerful higher-order GNNs. First, we extend the $k$-WL test for graphons (B\"oker, 2023) to the graphon-signal space and introduce signal-weighted homomorphism densities as a key tool. As an exemplary focus, we generalize Invariant Graph Networks (IGNs) to graphons, proposing Invariant Graphon Networks (IWNs) defined via a subset of the IGN basis corresponding to bounded linear operators. Even with this restricted basis, we show that IWNs of order $k$ are at least as powerful as the $k$-WL test, and we establish universal approximation results for graphon-signals in $L^p$ distances. This significantly extends the prior work of Cai & Wang (2022), showing that IWNs--a subset of their IGN-small--retain effectively the same expressivity as the full IGN basis in the limit. In contrast to their approach, our blueprint of IWNs also aligns better with the geometry of graphon space, for example facilitating comparability to MPNNs. We highlight that, while typical higher-order GNNs are discontinuous w.r.t. cut distance--which causes their lack of convergence and is inherently tied to the definition of $k$-WL--transferability remains achievable.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms and delivers high-quality solutions in real-time. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT and offline RL baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior offline and online RL approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogniSNN: A First Exploration to Random Graph Architecture based Spiking Neural Networks with Enhanced Expandability and Neuroplasticity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05992v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in spiking neural networks (SNNs) in numerous tasks, their architectures remain highly similar to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), restricting their ability to mimic natural connections between biological neurons. This paper develops a new modeling paradigm for SNN with random graph architecture (RGA), termed Cognition-aware SNN (CogniSNN). Furthermore, we improve the expandability and neuroplasticity of CogniSNN by introducing a modified spiking residual neural node (ResNode) to counteract network degradation in deeper graph pathways, as well as a critical path-based algorithm that enables CogniSNN to perform continual learning on new tasks leveraging the features of the data and the RGA learned in the old task. Experiments show that CogniSNN with re-designed ResNode performs outstandingly in neuromorphic datasets with fewer parameters, achieving 95.5% precision in the DVS-Gesture dataset with only 5 timesteps. The critical path-based approach decreases 3% to 5% forgetting while maintaining expected performance in learning new tasks that are similar to or distinct from the old ones. This study showcases the potential of RGA-based SNN and paves a new path for biologically inspired networks based on graph theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Graph Out-Of-Distribution Generalization: A Learnable Random Walk Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05785v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization has gained increasing attentions for machine learning on graphs, as graph neural networks (GNNs) often exhibit performance degradation under distribution shifts. Existing graph OOD methods tend to follow the basic ideas of invariant risk minimization and structural causal models, interpreting the invariant knowledge across datasets under various distribution shifts as graph topology or graph spectrum. However, these interpretations may be inconsistent with real-world scenarios, as neither invariant topology nor spectrum is assured. In this paper, we advocate the learnable random walk (LRW) perspective as the instantiation of invariant knowledge, and propose LRW-OOD to realize graph OOD generalization learning. Instead of employing fixed probability transition matrix (i.e., degree-normalized adjacency matrix), we parameterize the transition matrix with an LRW-sampler and a path encoder. Furthermore, we propose the kernel density estimation (KDE)-based mutual information (MI) loss to generate random walk sequences that adhere to OOD principles. Extensive experiment demonstrates that our model can effectively enhance graph OOD generalization under various types of distribution shifts and yield a significant accuracy improvement of 3.87% over state-of-the-art graph OOD generalization baselines.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[An Efficient Sparse Kernel Generator for O(3)-Equivariant Deep Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13986v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotation equivariant graph neural networks, i.e. networks designed to guarantee certain geometric relations between their inputs and outputs, yield state of the art performance on spatial deep learning tasks. They exhibit high data efficiency during training and significantly reduced inference time for interatomic potential calculations compared to classical approaches. Key to these models is the Clebsch-Gordon (CG) tensor product, a kernel that contracts two dense feature vectors with a highly-structured sparse tensor to produce a dense output vector. The operation, which may be repeated millions of times for typical equivariant models, is a costly and inefficient bottleneck. We introduce a GPU sparse kernel generator for the CG tensor product that provides significant speedups over the best existing open and closed-source implementations. Our implementation achieves high performance by carefully managing the limited GPU shared memory through static analysis at model compile-time, minimizing reads and writes to global memory. We break the tensor product into a series of smaller kernels with operands that fit entirely into registers, enabling us to emit long arithmetic instruction streams that maximize instruction-level parallelism. By fusing the CG tensor product with a subsequent graph convolution, we reduce both intermediate storage and global memory traffic over naive approaches that duplicate input data. We also provide optimized kernels for the gradient of the CG tensor product and a novel identity for the higher partial derivatives required to predict interatomic forces. Our kernels offer up to 1.3x speedup over NVIDIA's closed-source cuEquivariance package, as well as 10x speedup over the widely-used e3nn package. In FP64 precision, we offer up to 6.2x inference-time speedup for the MACE chemistry foundation model over the original unoptimized version.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Proceedings of the 2025 SIAM Conference on Applied and Computational Discrete Algorithms. 15 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

We introduce AskGNN, a novel approach that bridges this gap by leveraging In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate graph data and task-specific information into LLMs. AskGNN employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-powered structure-enhanced retriever to select labeled nodes across graphs, incorporating complex graph structures and their supervision signals. Our learning-to-retrieve algorithm optimizes the retriever to select example nodes that maximize LLM performance on graph. Experiments across three tasks and seven LLMs demonstrate AskGNN's superior effectiveness in graph task performance, opening new avenues for applying LLMs to graph-structured data without extensive fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Aided Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resource Allocation in Dynamic Terahertz UAV Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04981v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Terahertz (THz) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with flexible topologies and ultra-high data rates are expected to empower numerous applications in security surveillance, disaster response, and environmental monitoring, among others. However, the dynamic topologies hinder the efficient long-term joint power and antenna array resource allocation for THz links among UAVs. Furthermore, the continuous nature of power and the discrete nature of antennas cause this joint resource allocation problem to be a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with non-convexity and NP-hardness. Inspired by recent rapid advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a graph neural network (GNN) aided DRL algorithm for resource allocation in the dynamic THz UAV network with an emphasis on self-node features (GLOVE) is proposed in this paper, with the aim of resource efficiency (RE) maximization. When training the allocation policy for each UAV, GLOVE learns the relationship between this UAV and its neighboring UAVs via GNN, while also emphasizing the important self-node features of this UAV. In addition, a multi-task structure is leveraged by GLOVE to cooperatively train resource allocation decisions for the power and sub-arrays of all UAVs. Experimental results illustrate that GLOVE outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of the highest RE and the lowest latency. Moreover, unlike the benchmark methods with severe packet loss, GLOVE maintains zero packet loss during the entire training process, demonstrating its better robustness under the highly dynamic THz UAV network.</p></details> |  |

In light of these disadvantages, we develop PASSAT, a novel Physics-ASSisted And Topology-informed deep learning model for weather prediction. PASSAT attributes the weather evolution to two key factors: (i) the advection process that can be characterized by the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes equation; (ii) the Earth-atmosphere interaction that is difficult to both model and calculate. PASSAT also takes the topology of the Earth's surface into consideration, other than simply treating it as a plane. With these considerations, PASSAT numerically solves the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes equation on the spherical manifold, utilizes a spherical graph neural network to capture the Earth-atmosphere interaction, and generates the initial velocity fields that are critical to solving the advection equation from the same spherical graph neural network. In the $5.625^\circ$-resolution ERA5 data set, PASSAT outperforms both the state-of-the-art deep learning-based weather prediction models and the operational numerical weather prediction model IFS T42.

These improvements enhance traffic safety and entertainment services. However, the limited coverage and frequent handovers in 5G networks cause network instability, especially in high-mobility environments due to the ping-pong effect. This paper presents TH-GCN (Throughput-oriented Graph Convolutional Network), a novel approach for optimizing handover management in dense 5G networks. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), TH-GCN models vehicles and base stations as nodes in a dynamic graph enriched with features such as signal quality, throughput, vehicle speed, and base station load. By integrating both user equipment and base station perspectives, this dual-centric approach enables adaptive, real-time handover decisions that improve network stability. Simulation results show that TH-GCN reduces handovers by up to 78 percent and improves signal quality by 10 percent, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE DCOSS-IoT 2025</p></details> |

The transport network - responsible for interconnecting the radio access network and core networks - will increasingly face challenges in efficiently managing complex traffic patterns. The Network Digital Twin (NDT) concept emerges as a promising solution for testing configurations and algorithms in a virtual network before real-world deployment. In this context, this work designs an experimental platform with NDT in a transport network domain, synchronizing with the virtual counterpart and a recommendation system for what-if analysis, enabling intelligent decision-making for dynamic route optimization problems in 5G/B5G scenarios. Our NDT, composed of a Graph Neural Network (GNN), was evaluated across three different network topologies consisting of 8, 16, and 30 nodes. It achieved lower MAPE values for URLLC and eMBB slices, comparing latency predictions with actual latency after the solution implementation. These values indicate high accuracy, demonstrating the solution's effectiveness in generating precise insights into network performance if a particular solution were implemented.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Communications. \c{opyright}2025 IEEE.

| **[XG-NID: Dual-Modality Network Intrusion Detection using a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network and Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16021v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, the integration of flow-level and packet-level information for real-time intrusion detection remains a largely untapped area of research. This paper introduces "XG-NID," a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to fuse flow-level and packet-level data within a heterogeneous graph structure, offering a comprehensive analysis of network traffic. Leveraging a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) with graph-level classification, XG-NID uniquely enables real-time inference while effectively capturing the intricate relationships between flow and packet payload data. Unlike traditional GNN-based methodologies that predominantly analyze historical data, XG-NID is designed to accommodate the heterogeneous nature of network traffic, providing a robust and real-time defense mechanism. Our framework extends beyond mere classification; it integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed, human-readable explanations and suggest potential remedial actions, ensuring that the insights produced are both actionable and comprehensible. Additionally, we introduce a new set of flow features based on temporal information, further enhancing the contextual and explainable inferences provided by our model. To facilitate practical application and accessibility, we developed "GNN4ID," an open-source tool that enables the extraction and transformation of raw network traffic into the proposed heterogeneous graph structure, seamlessly integrating flow and packet-level data. Our comprehensive quantitative comparative analysis demonstrates that XG-NID achieves an F1 score of 97\% in multi-class classification, outperforming existing baseline and state-of-the-art methods. This sets a new standard in Network Intrusion Detection Systems by combining innovative data fusion with enhanced interpretability and real-time capabilities.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Piecewise Constant Spectral Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04808v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success across various domains by leveraging graph structures in data. Existing spectral GNNs, which use low-degree polynomial filters to capture graph spectral properties, may not fully identify the graph's spectral characteristics because of the polynomial's small degree. However, increasing the polynomial degree is computationally expensive and beyond certain thresholds leads to performance plateaus or degradation. In this paper, we introduce the Piecewise Constant Spectral Graph Neural Network(PieCoN) to address these challenges. PieCoN combines constant spectral filters with polynomial filters to provide a more flexible way to leverage the graph structure. By adaptively partitioning the spectrum into intervals, our approach increases the range of spectral properties that can be effectively learned. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, demonstrate that PieCoN is particularly effective on heterophilic datasets, highlighting its potential for a wide range of applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TMLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Compare Hardware Designs for High-Level Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13138v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level synthesis (HLS) is an automated design process that transforms high-level code into hardware designs, enabling the rapid development of hardware accelerators. HLS relies on pragmas, which are directives inserted into the source code to guide the synthesis process, and pragmas have various settings and values that significantly impact the resulting hardware design. State-of-the-art ML-based HLS methods, such as HARP, first train a deep learning model, typically based on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to graph-based representations of the source code and pragmas. They then perform design space exploration (DSE) to explore the pragma design space, rank candidate designs using the model, and return the top designs. However, traditional DSE methods face challenges due to the highly nonlinear relationship between pragma settings and performance metrics, along with complex interactions between pragmas that affect performance in non-obvious ways. To address these challenges, we propose compareXplore, a novel approach that learns to compare hardware designs for effective HLS optimization. CompareXplore introduces a hybrid loss function that combines pairwise preference learning with pointwise performance prediction, enabling the model to capture both relative preferences and absolute performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel node difference attention module that focuses on the most informative differences between designs, enabling the model to identify critical pragmas impacting performance. CompareXplore adopts a two-stage DSE, where a pointwise prediction model is used for the initial design pruning, followed by a pairwise comparison stage for precise performance verification. In extensive experiments, compareXplore achieves significant improvements in ranking metrics and generates high-quality HLS results for the selected designs, outperforming the existing SOTA method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in MLCAD 2024</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Granular Attention based Heterogeneous Hypergraph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04340v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HeteGNNs) have demonstrated strong abilities to learn node representations by effectively extracting complex structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs. Most of the prevailing HeteGNNs follow the neighborhood aggregation paradigm, leveraging meta-path based message passing to learn latent node representations. However, due to the pairwise nature of meta-paths, these models fail to capture high-order relations among nodes, resulting in suboptimal performance. Additionally, the challenge of ``over-squashing'', where long-range message passing in HeteGNNs leads to severe information distortion, further limits the efficacy of these models. To address these limitations, this paper proposes MGA-HHN, a Multi-Granular Attention based Heterogeneous Hypergraph Neural Network for heterogeneous graph representation learning. MGA-HHN introduces two key innovations: (1) a novel approach for constructing meta-path based heterogeneous hypergraphs that explicitly models higher-order semantic information in heterogeneous graphs through multiple views, and (2) a multi-granular attention mechanism that operates at both the node and hyperedge levels. This mechanism enables the model to capture fine-grained interactions among nodes sharing the same semantic context within a hyperedge type, while preserving the diversity of semantics across different hyperedge types. As such, MGA-HHN effectively mitigates long-range message distortion and generates more expressive node representations. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGA-HHN outperforms state-of-the-art models, showcasing its effectiveness in node classification, node clustering and visualization tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, in conventional approaches, prediction models were often constructed using each type of data separately. Our model enables more accurate prediction of physical properties for polymers by combining features extracted from the chemical structure by graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) with features such as molecular descriptors and additive information. The predictive performance of the proposed method is empirically evaluated using several polymer datasets. We report that the proposed method shows high predictive performance compared to the baseline conventional approach using a single feature.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Literature Review of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network Models for Time Series Forecasting and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22377v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and over 150 journal papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Commute Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01635v6)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in learning from graph-structured data. However, their application to directed graphs (digraphs) presents unique challenges, primarily due to the inherent asymmetry in node relationships. Traditional GNNs are adept at capturing unidirectional relations but fall short in encoding the mutual path dependencies between nodes, such as asymmetrical shortest paths typically found in digraphs. Recognizing this gap, we introduce Commute Graph Neural Networks (CGNN), an approach that seamlessly integrates node-wise commute time into the message passing scheme. The cornerstone of CGNN is an efficient method for computing commute time using a newly formulated digraph Laplacian. Commute time is then integrated into the neighborhood aggregation process, with neighbor contributions weighted according to their respective commute time to the central node in each layer. It enables CGNN to directly capture the mutual, asymmetric relationships in digraphs. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarking datasets confirm the superiority of CGNN against 13 state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Although large-scale online data and automated techniques have enabled the quantitative analysis of uncivil discourse, prior research has predominantly focused on impoliteness or toxicity, often overlooking other behaviors that undermine democratic values. To address this gap, we propose a multidimensional conceptual framework encompassing Impoliteness, Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric, Hate Speech and Stereotyping, and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values. Using this framework, we measure the spread of online political incivility in Brazil using approximately 5 million tweets posted by 2,307 political influencers during the 2022 Brazilian general election. Through statistical modeling and network analysis, we examine the dynamics of uncivil posts at different election stages, identify key disseminators and audiences, and explore the mechanisms driving the spread of uncivil information online. Our findings indicate that impoliteness is more likely to surge during election campaigns. In contrast, the other dimensions of incivility are often triggered by specific violent events. Moreover, we find that left-aligned individual influencers are the primary disseminators of online incivility in the Brazilian Twitter/X sphere and that they disseminate not only direct incivility but also indirect incivility when discussing or opposing incivility expressed by others. They relay those content from politicians, media agents, and individuals to reach broader audiences, revealing a diffusion pattern mixing the direct and two-step flows of communication theory. This study offers new insights into the multidimensional nature of incivility in Brazilian politics and provides a conceptual framework that can be extended to other political contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ICWSM 2025</p></details> |

Previous methods are primarily trained on synthetic data and cope with the limited amount of such data by using low-dimensional intermediate representations, such as guide strands and scalp-level embeddings, that require post-processing to decode, upsample, and add realism. These approaches fail to reconstruct detailed hair, struggle with curly hair, or are limited to handling only a few hairstyles. To overcome these limitations, we propose DiffLocks, a novel framework that enables detailed reconstruction of a wide variety of hairstyles directly from a single image. First, we address the lack of 3D hair data by automating the creation of the largest synthetic hair dataset to date, containing 40K hairstyles. Second, we leverage the synthetic hair dataset to learn an image-conditioned diffusion-transfomer model that generates accurate 3D strands from a single frontal image. By using a pretrained image backbone, our method generalizes to in-the-wild images despite being trained only on synthetic data. Our diffusion model predicts a scalp texture map in which any point in the map contains the latent code for an individual hair strand. These codes are directly decoded to 3D strands without post-processing techniques. Representing individual strands, instead of guide strands, enables the transformer to model the detailed spatial structure of complex hairstyles. With this, DiffLocks can recover highly curled hair, like afro hairstyles, from a single image for the first time.

We introduce a framework, SetItUp, for learning to interpret under-specified instructions. SetItUp takes a small number of training examples and a human-crafted program sketch to uncover arrangement rules for specific scene types. By leveraging an intermediate graph-like representation of abstract spatial relationships among objects, SetItUp decomposes the arrangement problem into two subproblems: i) learning the arrangement patterns from limited data and ii) grounding these abstract relationships into object poses. SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to propose the abstract spatial relationships among objects in novel scenes as the constraints to be satisfied; then, it composes a library of diffusion models associated with these abstract relationships to find object poses that satisfy the constraints. We validate our framework on a dataset comprising study desks, dining tables, and coffee tables, with the results showing superior performance in generating physically plausible, functional, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements compared to existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main paper, 21 pages appendix, RSS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Photovoltaic Defect Image Generator with Boundary Alignment Smoothing Constraint for Domain Shift Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06117v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate defect detection of photovoltaic (PV) cells is critical for ensuring quality and efficiency in intelligent PV manufacturing systems. However, the scarcity of rich defect data poses substantial challenges for effective model training. While existing methods have explored generative models to augment datasets, they often suffer from instability, limited diversity, and domain shifts. To address these issues, we propose PDIG, a Photovoltaic Defect Image Generator based on Stable Diffusion (SD). PDIG leverages the strong priors learned from large-scale datasets to enhance generation quality under limited data. Specifically, we introduce a Semantic Concept Embedding (SCE) module that incorporates text-conditioned priors to capture the relational concepts between defect types and their appearances. To further enrich the domain distribution, we design a Lightweight Industrial Style Adaptor (LISA), which injects industrial defect characteristics into the SD model through cross-disentangled attention. At inference, we propose a Text-Image Dual-Space Constraints (TIDSC) module, enforcing the quality of generated images via positional consistency and spatial smoothing alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDIG achieves superior realism and diversity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our approach improves Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 19.16 points over the second-best method and significantly enhances the performance of downstream defect detection tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Diffusion Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06087v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the fundamental problems within the field of machine learning is dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction methods make it possible to combat the so-called curse of dimensionality, visualize high-dimensional data and, in general, improve the efficiency of storing and processing large data sets. One of the best-known nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods is Diffusion Maps. However, despite their virtues, both Diffusion Maps and many other manifold learning methods based on the spectral decomposition of kernel matrices have drawbacks such as the inability to apply them to data outside the initial set, their computational complexity, and high memory costs for large data sets. In this work, we propose to alleviate these problems by resorting to deep learning. Specifically, a new formulation of Diffusion Maps embedding is offered as a solution to a certain unconstrained minimization problem and, based on it, a cost function to train a neural network which computes Diffusion Maps embedding -- both inside and outside the training sample -- without the need to perform any spectral decomposition. The capabilities of this approach are compared on different data sets, both real and synthetic, with those of Diffusion Maps and the Nystrom method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noise-Consistent Siamese-Diffusion for Medical Image Synthesis and Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06068v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has revolutionized medical image segmentation, yet its full potential remains constrained by the paucity of annotated datasets. While diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for generating synthetic image-mask pairs to augment these datasets, they paradoxically suffer from the same data scarcity challenges they aim to mitigate. Traditional mask-only models frequently yield low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological intricacies, which can critically compromise the robustness and reliability of segmentation models. To alleviate this limitation, we introduce Siamese-Diffusion, a novel dual-component model comprising Mask-Diffusion and Image-Diffusion. During training, a Noise Consistency Loss is introduced between these components to enhance the morphological fidelity of Mask-Diffusion in the parameter space. During sampling, only Mask-Diffusion is used, ensuring diversity and scalability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Siamese-Diffusion boosts SANet's mDice and mIoU by 3.6% and 4.4% on the Polyps, while UNet improves by 1.52% and 1.64% on the ISIC2018.

| **[Towards Better Cephalometric Landmark Detection with Diffusion Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06055v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cephalometric landmark detection is essential for orthodontic diagnostics and treatment planning. Nevertheless, the scarcity of samples in data collection and the extensive effort required for manual annotation have significantly impeded the availability of diverse datasets. This limitation has restricted the effectiveness of deep learning-based detection methods, particularly those based on large-scale vision models. To address these challenges, we have developed an innovative data generation method capable of producing diverse cephalometric X-ray images along with corresponding annotations without human intervention. To achieve this, our approach initiates by constructing new cephalometric landmark annotations using anatomical priors. Then, we employ a diffusion-based generator to create realistic X-ray images that correspond closely with these annotations. To achieve precise control in producing samples with different attributes, we introduce a novel prompt cephalometric X-ray image dataset. This dataset includes real cephalometric X-ray images and detailed medical text prompts describing the images. By leveraging these detailed prompts, our method improves the generation process to control different styles and attributes. Facilitated by the large, diverse generated data, we introduce large-scale vision detection models into the cephalometric landmark detection task to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that training with the generated data substantially enhances the performance. Compared to methods without using the generated data, our approach improves the Success Detection Rate (SDR) by 6.5%, attaining a notable 82.2%.

Using techniques from stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy relations for diffusion models, which are inequalities that relate the accuracy of data generation to the entropy production rate. This relation can be interpreted as the speed of the diffusion dynamics in the absence of the non-conservative force. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the geodesic of space of the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy relations for diffusion models with different noise schedules and different data. We numerically discuss our results for optimal and suboptimal learning protocols. We also demonstrate the applicability of our results to data generation from the real-world image datasets.</p></details> | 37 pages, 9 figures |

Conventional approaches, including independent learning frameworks and value decomposition methods based on pessimistic principles, remain susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions and often yield suboptimal performance. Through systematic analysis of prevalent offline MARL benchmarks, we identify that this limitation primarily stems from the inherently multimodal nature of joint collaborative policies induced by offline data collection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework: First, we employ a diffusion-based generative model to explicitly capture the complex behavior policy, enabling accurate modeling of diverse multi-agent coordination patterns. Second, we introduce a sequential score function decomposition mechanism to regularize individual policies and enable decentralized execution. Extensive experiments on continuous control tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple standard offline MARL benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by 26.3\% in normalized returns. Our approach provides new insights into offline coordination and equilibrium selection in cooperative multi-agent systems.</p></details> | Working papers |

We introduce the diffusion piecewise exponential model, a prior framework consisting of a discretised diffusion for the hazard, that can encode a wide variety of information about the long-term behaviour of the hazard, time changed by a Poisson process prior for knot locations. This allows the behaviour of the hazard in the observation period to be combined with prior information to inform extrapolations. Efficient posterior sampling is achieved using Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes, whereby we extend existing approaches using sticky dynamics from sampling spike-and-slab distributions to more general transdimensional posteriors. We focus on applications in Health Technology Assessment, where the need to compute mean survival requires hazard functions to be extrapolated beyond the observation period, showcasing performance on datasets for Colon cancer and Leukaemia patients.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages (+ references), 8 Figures, 3 Tables</p></details> |

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

In the first stage, an intermediate denoising result is generated by the diffusion model to predict the final synthesized image with one-step denoising, and a counting model is used to count the number of objects in this image. In the second stage, a correction module is used to correct the object quantity by changing the attention map of the object with universal guidance. The proposed CountDiffusion can be plugged into any diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation models without further training. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CountDiffusion, which improves the accurate object quantity generation ability of T2I models by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

While unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are commonly used for indoor farm monitoring, their deployment in greenhouses is often constrained by infrastructure limitations, sensor placement challenges, and operational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we develop a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB-D camera, a 3D LiDAR, and an IMU sensor. The UAV employs a LiDAR-inertial odometry algorithm for precise navigation in GNSS-denied environments and utilizes a 3D multi-object tracking algorithm to estimate the count and weight of cherry tomatoes. We evaluate the system using two dataset: one from a harvesting row and another from a growing row. In the harvesting-row dataset, the proposed system achieves 94.4\% counting accuracy and 87.5\% weight estimation accuracy within a 13.2-meter flight completed in 10.5 seconds. For the growing-row dataset, which consists of occluded unripened fruits, we qualitatively analyze tracking performance and highlight future research directions for improving perception in greenhouse with strong occlusions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of UAVs for efficient robotic yield estimation in commercial greenhouses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 ICRA workshop on field robotics</p></details> |

This might be partially the result of the fact that Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT), a critical training step for MLLMs, has traditionally focused on scaling data volume, but not the compositional complexity of training examples. We propose COMPACT (COMPositional Atomic-to-complex visual Capability Tuning), which generates a training dataset explicitly controlling for the compositional complexity of the training examples. The data from COMPACT allows MLLMs to train on combinations of atomic capabilities to learn complex capabilities more efficiently. Across all benchmarks, COMPACT achieves comparable performance to the LLaVA-665k VIT while using less than 10% of its data budget, and even outperforms it on several, especially those involving complex multi-capability tasks. For example, COMPACT achieves substantial 83.3% improvement on MMStar and 94.0% improvement on MM-Vet compared to the full-scale VIT on particularly complex questions that require four or more atomic capabilities. COMPACT offers a scalable, data-efficient, visual compositional tuning recipe to improve on complex visual-language tasks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Rethinking Visual Layer Selection in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21447v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, typically using CLIP-ViT as their visual encoder due to its strong text-image alignment capabilities. While prior studies suggest that different CLIP-ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, most MLLMs still select visual features based on empirical heuristics rather than systematic analysis. In this work, we propose a Layer-wise Representation Similarity approach to group CLIP-ViT layers with similar behaviors into {shallow, middle, and deep} categories and assess their impact on MLLM performance. Building on this foundation, we revisit the visual layer selection problem in MLLMs at scale, training LLaVA-style models ranging from 1.4B to 7B parameters. Through extensive experiments across 10 datasets and 4 tasks, we find that: (1) deep layers are essential for OCR tasks; (2) shallow and middle layers substantially outperform deep layers on reasoning tasks involving counting, positioning, and object localization; (3) a lightweight fusion of features across shallow, middle, and deep layers consistently outperforms specialized fusion baselines and single-layer selections, achieving gains on 9 out of 10 datasets. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, laying the groundwork for deeper investigations into visual representation learning for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Class-Agnostic Counting: Advancements from Reference-Based to Open-World Text-Guided Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19184v3)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual object counting has recently shifted towards class-agnostic counting (CAC), which addresses the challenge of counting objects across arbitrary categories -- a crucial capability for flexible and generalizable counting systems. Unlike humans, who effortlessly identify and count objects from diverse categories without prior knowledge, most existing counting methods are restricted to enumerating instances of known classes, requiring extensive labeled datasets for training and struggling in open-vocabulary settings. In contrast, CAC aims to count objects belonging to classes never seen during training, operating in a few-shot setting. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive review of CAC methodologies. We propose a taxonomy to categorize CAC approaches into three paradigms based on how target object classes can be specified: reference-based, reference-less, and open-world text-guided. Reference-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance by relying on exemplar-guided mechanisms. Reference-less methods eliminate exemplar dependency by leveraging inherent image patterns. Finally, open-world text-guided methods use vision-language models, enabling object class descriptions via textual prompts, offering a flexible and promising solution. Based on this taxonomy, we provide an overview of the architectures of 29 CAC approaches and report their results on gold-standard benchmarks. We compare their performance and discuss their strengths and limitations. Specifically, we present results on the FSC-147 dataset, setting a leaderboard using gold-standard metrics, and on the CARPK dataset to assess generalization capabilities. Finally, we offer a critical discussion of persistent challenges, such as annotation dependency and generalization, alongside future directions. We believe this survey will be a valuable resource, showcasing CAC advancements and guiding future research.</p></details> |  |

Different from previous works that are limited to singulating them using suction cups or soft grippers, RoTipBot can count multiple layers and then grasp them simultaneously in a single grasp closure. Specifically, we first develop a vision-based tactile sensor named RoTip that can rotate and sense contact information around its tip. Equipped with two RoTip sensors, RoTipBot rolls and feeds multiple layers of thin, flexible objects into the centre between its fingers, enabling effective grasping. Moreover, we design a tactile-based grasping strategy that uses RoTip's sensing ability to ensure both fingers maintain secure contact with the object while accurately counting the number of fed objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the RoTip sensor and the RoTipBot approach. The results show that RoTipBot not only achieves a higher success rate but also grasps and counts multiple layers simultaneously -- capabilities not possible with previous methods. Furthermore, RoTipBot operates up to three times faster than state-of-the-art methods. The success of RoTipBot paves the way for future research in object manipulation using mobilised tactile sensors.

| **[SDVPT: Semantic-Driven Visual Prompt Tuning for Open-World Object Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17395v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-world object counting leverages the robust text-image alignment of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to enable counting of arbitrary categories in images specified by textual queries. However, widely adopted naive fine-tuning strategies concentrate exclusively on text-image consistency for categories contained in training, which leads to limited generalizability for unseen categories. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play Semantic-Driven Visual Prompt Tuning framework (SDVPT) that transfers knowledge from the training set to unseen categories with minimal overhead in parameters and inference time. First, we introduce a two-stage visual prompt learning strategy composed of Category-Specific Prompt Initialization (CSPI) and Topology-Guided Prompt Refinement (TGPR). The CSPI generates category-specific visual prompts, and then TGPR distills latent structural patterns from the VLM's text encoder to refine these prompts. During inference, we dynamically synthesize the visual prompts for unseen categories based on the semantic correlation between unseen and training categories, facilitating robust text-image alignment for unseen categories. Extensive experiments integrating SDVPT with all available open-world object counting models demonstrate its effectiveness and adaptability across three widely used datasets: FSC-147, CARPK, and PUCPR+.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPTURe: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Occluded Object Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15485v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty counting in images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/atinpothiraj/CAPTURe</p></details> |
| **[ProgRoCC: A Progressive Approach to Rough Crowd Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13405v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the number of individuals in a crowd grows, enumeration-based techniques become increasingly infeasible and their estimates increasingly unreliable. We propose instead an estimation-based version of the problem: we label Rough Crowd Counting that delivers better accuracy on the basis of training data that is easier to acquire. Rough crowd counting requires only rough annotations of the number of targets in an image, instead of the more traditional, and far more expensive, per-target annotations. We propose an approach to the rough crowd counting problem based on CLIP, termed ProgRoCC. Specifically, we introduce a progressive estimation learning strategy that determines the object count through a coarse-to-fine approach. This approach delivers answers quickly, outperforms the state-of-the-art in semi- and weakly-supervised crowd counting. In addition, we design a vision-language matching adapter that optimizes key-value pairs by mining effective matches of two modalities to refine the visual features, thereby improving the final performance. Extensive experimental results on three widely adopted crowd counting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[LAD-Reasoner: Tiny Multimodal Models are Good Reasoners for Logical Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12749v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in industrial anomaly detection have highlighted the need for deeper logical anomaly analysis, where unexpected relationships among objects, counts, and spatial configurations must be identified and explained. Existing approaches often rely on large-scale external reasoning modules or elaborate pipeline designs, hindering practical deployment and interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Logical Anomaly Detection (RLAD), which extends traditional anomaly detection by incorporating logical reasoning. We propose a new framework, LAD-Reasoner, a customized tiny multimodal language model built on Qwen2.5-VL 3B. Our approach leverages a two-stage training paradigm that first employs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for fine-grained visual understanding, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine logical anomaly detection and enforce coherent, human-readable reasoning. Crucially, reward signals are derived from both the detection accuracy and the structural quality of the outputs, obviating the need for building chain of thought (CoT) reasoning data. Experiments on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset show that LAD-Reasoner, though significantly smaller, matches the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B in accuracy and F1 score, and further excels in producing concise and interpretable rationales. This unified design reduces reliance on large models and complex pipelines, while offering transparent and interpretable insights into logical anomaly detection. Code and data will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Limits of Vision Language Models Through the Lens of the Binding Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00238v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has documented striking heterogeneity in the performance of state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), including both multimodal language models and text-to-image models. These models are able to describe and generate a diverse array of complex, naturalistic images, yet they exhibit surprising failures on basic multi-object reasoning tasks -- such as counting, localization, and simple forms of visual analogy -- that humans perform with near perfect accuracy. To better understand this puzzling pattern of successes and failures, we turn to theoretical accounts of the binding problem in cognitive science and neuroscience, a fundamental problem that arises when a shared set of representational resources must be used to represent distinct entities (e.g., to represent multiple objects in an image), necessitating the use of serial processing to avoid interference. We find that many of the puzzling failures of state-of-the-art VLMs can be explained as arising due to the binding problem, and that these failure modes are strikingly similar to the limitations exhibited by rapid, feedforward processing in the human brain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning What NOT to Count](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11705v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few/zero-shot object counting methods reduce the need for extensive annotations but often struggle to distinguish between fine-grained categories, especially when multiple similar objects appear in the same scene. To address this limitation, we propose an annotation-free approach that enables the seamless integration of new fine-grained categories into existing few/zero-shot counting models. By leveraging latent generative models, we synthesize high-quality, category-specific crowded scenes, providing a rich training source for adapting to new categories without manual labeling. Our approach introduces an attention prediction network that identifies fine-grained category boundaries trained using only synthetic pseudo-annotated data. At inference, these fine-grained attention estimates refine the output of existing few/zero-shot counting networks. To benchmark our method, we further introduce the FGTC dataset, a taxonomy-specific fine-grained object counting dataset for natural images. Our method substantially enhances pre-trained state-of-the-art models on fine-grained taxon counting tasks, while using only synthetic data. Code and data to be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

The deployment of a SNN usually requires partitioning the network and mapping these partitions onto the hardware's processing units. However, finding optimal deployment configurations is an NP-hard problem, often addressed through optimization algorithms. While some objectives (e.g., memory utilization and chip count) are static, others (e.g., communication latency and energy efficiency) depend on the network's dynamic behavior, necessitating dynamic-aware optimization. To address this, we model SNN dynamics using an Ising-type pairwise interaction framework, bridging microscopic neuron interactions with macroscopic network behavior. We optimize deployment by exploring the parameter and configuration spaces of the Ising model. We evaluate our approach on two SNNs deployed on the sPyNNaker neuromorphic platform. Initial results suggest that the method underperforms, potentially due to the Ising model's equilibrium assumptions and the architectural complexity of real-world neuromorphic hardware, highlighting limitations in its current formulation. Update: The method proposed is with a equilibrium-dynamics SNN assumption, and the original paper does not mention this. The paper needs to be revisited and reuploaded after further experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[COUNTS: Benchmarking Object Detectors and Multimodal Large Language Models under Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10158v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current object detectors often suffer significant perfor-mance degradation in real-world applications when encountering distributional shifts. Consequently, the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capability of object detectors has garnered increasing attention from researchers. Despite this growing interest, there remains a lack of a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and evaluation benchmark with fine-grained annotations tailored to assess the OOD generalization on more intricate tasks like object detection and grounding. To address this gap, we introduce COUNTS, a large-scale OOD dataset with object-level annotations. COUNTS encompasses 14 natural distributional shifts, over 222K samples, and more than 1,196K labeled bounding boxes. Leveraging COUNTS, we introduce two novel benchmarks: O(OD)2 and OODG. O(OD)2 is designed to comprehensively evaluate the OOD generalization capabilities of object detectors by utilizing controlled distribution shifts between training and testing data. OODG, on the other hand, aims to assess the OOD generalization of grounding abilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our findings reveal that, while large models and extensive pre-training data substantially en hance performance in in-distribution (IID) scenarios, significant limitations and opportunities for improvement persist in OOD contexts for both object detectors and MLLMs. In visual grounding tasks, even the advanced GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 only achieve 56.7% and 28.0% accuracy, respectively. We hope COUNTS facilitates advancements in the development and assessment of robust object detectors and MLLMs capable of maintaining high performance under distributional shifts.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that employs Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting, enhancing image-text alignment and facilitating more coherent multi-object image editing. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the self-correction task into three critical dimensions (counting, attributes, and spatial relationships), and further divided into object-level subtasks. We construct a multi-agent editing system featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To resolve the problem of subtask integration, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother that employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtask results, thereby enhancing runtime efficiency while eliminating multi-stage distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the segmentation of these reconstructed 3D scenes is more essential for downstream tasks such as object counting, size estimation, and scene understanding. While segmentation on raw 3D point clouds using deep learning requires labor intensive and time-consuming manual annotation, directly training NeRF on binary masks also fails due to the absence of color and shading cues essential for geometry learning. We propose Invariant NeRF for Segmentation (InvNeRFSeg), a two step, zero change fine tuning strategy for 3D segmentation. We first train a standard NeRF on RGB images and then fine tune it using 2D segmentation masks without altering either the model architecture or loss function. This approach produces higher quality, cleaner segmented point clouds directly from the refined radiance field with minimal computational overhead or complexity. Field density analysis reveals consistent semantic refinement: densities of object regions increase while background densities are suppressed, ensuring clean and interpretable segmentations. We demonstrate InvNeRFSegs superior performance over both SA3D and FruitNeRF on both synthetic fruit and real world soybean datasets. This approach effectively extends 2D segmentation to high quality 3D segmentation.</p></details> |  |

A Human Evaluation Benchmark for Counting Limits in Modern Text-to-Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04051v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have driven significant progress in a variety of AI tasks, including text-to-video generation, where models like Video LDM and Stable Video Diffusion can produce realistic, movie-level videos from textual instructions. Despite these advances, current text-to-video models still face fundamental challenges in reliably following human commands, particularly in adhering to simple numerical constraints. In this work, we present T2VCountBench, a specialized benchmark aiming at evaluating the counting capability of SOTA text-to-video models as of 2025. Our benchmark employs rigorous human evaluations to measure the number of generated objects and covers a diverse range of generators, covering both open-source and commercial models. Extensive experiments reveal that all existing models struggle with basic numerical tasks, almost always failing to generate videos with an object count of 9 or fewer. Furthermore, our comprehensive ablation studies explore how factors like video style, temporal dynamics, and multilingual inputs may influence counting performance. We also explore prompt refinement techniques and demonstrate that decomposing the task into smaller subtasks does not easily alleviate these limitations. Our findings highlight important challenges in current text-to-video generation and provide insights for future research aimed at improving adherence to basic numerical constraints.</p></details> |  |

We depart from previous works that rely on learning instance-level latent space, focusing on man-made articulated objects with predefined part counts. Instead, we propose a novel alternative approach that employs part-level representation, representing instances as combinations of detected parts. While our detect-then-group approach effectively handles instances with diverse part structures and various part counts, it faces issues of false positives, varying part sizes and scales, and an increasing model size due to end-to-end training. To address these challenges, we propose 1) test-time kinematics-aware part fusion to improve detection performance while suppressing false positives, 2) anisotropic scale normalization for part shape learning to accommodate various part sizes and scales, and 3) a balancing strategy for cross-refinement between feature space and output space to improve part detection while maintaining model size. Evaluation on both synthetic and real data demonstrates that our method successfully reconstructs variously structured multiple instances that previous works cannot handle, and outperforms prior works in shape reconstruction and kinematics estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on general image captioning, they often fail to capture the nuanced interpretations that fine art demands. We propose ArtRAG, a novel, training-free framework that combines structured knowledge with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multi-perspective artwork explanation. ArtRAG automatically constructs an Art Context Knowledge Graph (ACKG) from domain-specific textual sources, organizing entities such as artists, movements, themes, and historical events into a rich, interpretable graph. At inference time, a multi-granular structured retriever selects semantically and topologically relevant subgraphs to guide generation. This enables MLLMs to produce contextually grounded, culturally informed art descriptions. Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG outperforms several heavily trained baselines. Human evaluations further confirm that ArtRAG generates coherent, insightful, and culturally enriched interpretations.</p></details> |  |

In our setting, a speaker attempts to communicate some information to a listener in a single-turn dialogue and receives a reward if communicative success is achieved. Unlike earlier related work using image--caption data for interactive reference games, we operationalize communicative success in a more abstract language-only question--answering setting. First, we present a feasibility study demonstrating that our reward provides an indirect signal about grammaticality. Second, we conduct experiments using reinforcement learning to fine-tune language models. We observe that cognitively plausible constraints on the communication channel lead to interpretable changes in speaker behavior. However, we do not yet see improvements on linguistic evaluations from our training regime. We outline potential modifications to the task design and training configuration that could better position future work to use our methodology to observe the benefits of interaction on language learning in computational cognitive models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Describe Anything in Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05804v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localized image captioning has made significant progress with models like the Describe Anything Model (DAM), which can generate detailed region-specific descriptions without explicit region-text supervision. However, such capabilities have yet to be widely applied to specialized domains like medical imaging, where diagnostic interpretation relies on subtle regional findings rather than global understanding. To mitigate this gap, we propose MedDAM, the first comprehensive framework leveraging large vision-language models for region-specific captioning in medical images. MedDAM employs medical expert-designed prompts tailored to specific imaging modalities and establishes a robust evaluation benchmark comprising a customized assessment protocol, data pre-processing pipeline, and specialized QA template library. This benchmark evaluates both MedDAM and other adaptable large vision-language models, focusing on clinical factuality through attribute-level verification tasks, thereby circumventing the absence of ground-truth region-caption pairs in medical datasets. Extensive experiments on the VinDr-CXR, LIDC-IDRI, and SkinCon datasets demonstrate MedDAM's superiority over leading peers (including GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, LLaMA-3.2 Vision, Qwen2.5-VL, GPT-4Rol, and OMG-LLaVA) in the task, revealing the importance of region-level semantic alignment in medical image understanding and establishing MedDAM as a promising foundation for clinical vision-language integration.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), which enhances fine-grained understanding through three key innovations. First, we leverage large multimodal models to generate 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for capturing global-level semantic details. Second, a high-quality dataset is constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic differences. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks, including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection, image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks. These results highlight FG-CLIP's effectiveness in capturing fine-grained image details and improving overall model performance.

It addresses critical challenges related to fairness, transparency, and ethical implications in these systems, providing a comparative analysis of key tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), image captioning, and visual dialogue. Background: Multimodal models, particularly vision-language models, enhance artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities by integrating visual and textual data, mimicking human learning processes. Despite significant advancements, the trustworthiness of these models remains a crucial concern, particularly as AI systems increasingly confront issues regarding fairness, transparency, and ethics. Methods: This review examines research conducted from 2017 to 2024 focusing on forenamed core vision-language tasks. It employs a comparative approach to analyze these tasks through the lens of trustworthiness, underlining fairness, explainability, and ethics.

Its effectiveness primarily stems from the use of natural language as rich supervision. Motivated by the remarkable advancements in large language models (LLMs), this work explores how LLMs' superior text understanding and extensive open-world knowledge can enhance CLIP's capability, especially for processing longer and more complex image captions. We propose an efficient post-training strategy that integrates LLMs into pretrained CLIP. To address the challenge posed by the autoregressive nature of LLMs, we introduce a caption-to-caption contrastive fine-tuning framework, significantly enhancing the discriminative quality of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms LoRA-based methods, achieving nearly fourfold faster training with superior performance. Furthermore, we validate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models such as CLIP, EVA02, and SigLip2 across various zero-shot multimodal retrieval tasks, cross-lingual retrieval tasks, and multimodal language model pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Image Captioning Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03420v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in vision-language models (VLMs) hinder reliability and real-world applicability, usually stemming from distribution shifts between pretraining data and test samples. Existing solutions, such as retraining or fine-tuning on additional data, demand significant computational resources and labor-intensive data collection, while ensemble-based methods incur additional costs by introducing auxiliary VLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time adaptation framework using reinforcement learning to mitigate hallucinations during inference without retraining or any auxiliary VLMs. By updating only the learnable parameters in the layer normalization of the language model (approximately 0.003% of the model parameters), our method reduces distribution shifts between test samples and pretraining samples. A CLIP-based hallucination evaluation model is proposed to provide dual rewards to VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate a 15.4% and 17.3% reduction in hallucination rates on LLaVA and InstructBLIP, respectively. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a 68.3% improvement in hallucination mitigation, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Word to Sentence: A Large-Scale Multi-Instance Dataset for Open-Set Aerial Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03334v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, language-guided open-world aerial object detection has gained significant attention due to its better alignment with real-world application needs. However, due to limited datasets, most existing language-guided methods primarily focus on vocabulary, which fails to meet the demands of more fine-grained open-world detection. To address this limitation, we propose constructing a large-scale language-guided open-set aerial detection dataset, encompassing three levels of language guidance: from words to phrases, and ultimately to sentences. Centered around an open-source large vision-language model and integrating image-operation-based preprocessing with BERT-based postprocessing, we present the OS-W2S Label Engine, an automatic annotation pipeline capable of handling diverse scene annotations for aerial images. Using this label engine, we expand existing aerial detection datasets with rich textual annotations and construct a novel benchmark dataset, called Multi-instance Open-set Aerial Dataset (MI-OAD), addressing the limitations of current remote sensing grounding data and enabling effective open-set aerial detection. Specifically, MI-OAD contains 163,023 images and 2 million image-caption pairs, approximately 40 times larger than comparable datasets. We also employ state-of-the-art open-set methods from the natural image domain, trained on our proposed dataset, to validate the model's open-set detection capabilities. For instance, when trained on our dataset, Grounding DINO achieves improvements of 29.5 AP_{50} and 33.7 Recall@10 for sentence inputs under zero-shot transfer conditions. Both the dataset and the label engine will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

Prior works have explored ever more complex KD strategies involving different objective functions, teacher-ensembles, and weight inheritance. In this work we explore an alternative, yet simple approach -- active data curation as effective distillation for contrastive multimodal pretraining. Our simple online batch selection method, ACID, outperforms strong KD baselines across various model-, data- and compute-configurations. Further, we find such an active data curation strategy to in fact be complementary to standard KD, and can be effectively combined to train highly performant inference-efficient models. Our simple and scalable pretraining framework, ACED, achieves state-of-the-art results across 27 zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks with upto 11% less inference FLOPs. We further demonstrate that our ACED models yield strong vision-encoders for training generative multimodal models in the LiT-Decoder setting, outperforming larger vision encoders for image-captioning and visual question-answering tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Compositional Image-Text Matching and Retrieval by Grounding Entities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02278v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language pretraining on large datasets of images-text pairs is one of the main building blocks of current Vision-Language Models. While with additional training, these models excel in various downstream tasks, including visual question answering, image captioning, and visual commonsense reasoning. However, a notable weakness of pretrained models like CLIP, is their inability to perform entity grounding and compositional image and text matching~\cite{Jiang2024ComCLIP, yang2023amc, Rajabi2023GroundedVSR, learninglocalizeCVPR24}. In this work we propose a novel learning-free zero-shot augmentation of CLIP embeddings that has favorable compositional properties. We compute separate embeddings of sub-images of object entities and relations that are localized by the state of the art open vocabulary detectors and dynamically adjust the baseline global image embedding. % The final embedding is obtained by computing a weighted combination of the sub-image embeddings. The resulting embedding is then utilized for similarity computation with text embedding, resulting in a average 1.5\% improvement in image-text matching accuracy on the Visual Genome and SVO Probes datasets~\cite{krishna2017visualgenome, svo}. Notably, the enhanced embeddings demonstrate superior retrieval performance, thus achieving significant gains on the Flickr30K and MS-COCO retrieval benchmarks~\cite{flickr30ke, mscoco}, improving the state-of-the-art Recall@1 by 12\% and 0.4\%, respectively.

| **[Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Black-Box Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01050v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) are increasingly deployed to offer advanced capabilities on inputs comprising both text and images. While prior research has shown that adversarial attacks can transfer from open-source to proprietary black-box models in text-only and vision-only contexts, the extent and effectiveness of such vulnerabilities remain underexplored for VLLMs. We present a comprehensive analysis demonstrating that targeted adversarial examples are highly transferable to widely-used proprietary VLLMs such as GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini. We show that attackers can craft perturbations to induce specific attacker-chosen interpretations of visual information, such as misinterpreting hazardous content as safe, overlooking sensitive or restricted material, or generating detailed incorrect responses aligned with the attacker's intent. Furthermore, we discover that universal perturbations -- modifications applicable to a wide set of images -- can consistently induce these misinterpretations across multiple proprietary VLLMs. Our experimental results on object recognition, visual question answering, and image captioning show that this vulnerability is common across current state-of-the-art models, and underscore an urgent need for robust mitigations to ensure the safe and secure deployment of VLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[AC-Lite : A Lightweight Image Captioning Model for Low-Resource Assamese Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01453v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing works in image caption synthesis use computation heavy deep neural networks and generates image descriptions in English language. This often restricts this important assistive tool for widespread use across language and accessibility barriers. This work presents AC-Lite, a computationally efficient model for image captioning in low-resource Assamese language. AC-Lite reduces computational requirements by replacing computation-heavy deep network components with lightweight alternatives. The AC-Lite model is designed through extensive ablation experiments with different image feature extractor networks and language decoders. A combination of ShuffleNetv2x1.5 with GRU based language decoder along with bilinear attention is found to provide the best performance with minimum compute. AC-Lite was observed to achieve an 82.3 CIDEr score on the COCO-AC dataset with 2.45 GFLOPs and 22.87M parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zoomer: Adaptive Image Focus Optimization for Black-box MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00742v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have broadened the scope of vision-language tasks, excelling in applications like image captioning and interactive question-answering. However, these models struggle with accurately processing visual data, particularly in tasks requiring precise object recognition and fine visual details. Stringent token limits often result in the omission of critical information, hampering performance. To address these limitations, we introduce \SysName, a novel visual prompting mechanism designed to enhance MLLM performance while preserving essential visual details within token limits. \SysName features three key innovations: a prompt-aware strategy that dynamically highlights relevant image regions, a spatial-preserving orchestration schema that maintains object integrity, and a budget-aware prompting method that balances global context with crucial visual details. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that \SysName consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving up to a $26.9\%$ improvement in accuracy while significantly reducing token consumption.</p></details> |  |
| **[XeMap: Contextual Referring in Large-Scale Remote Sensing Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00738v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in remote sensing (RS) imagery have provided high-resolution detail and vast coverage, yet existing methods, such as image-level captioning/retrieval and object-level detection/segmentation, often fail to capture mid-scale semantic entities essential for interpreting large-scale scenes. To address this, we propose the conteXtual referring Map (XeMap) task, which focuses on contextual, fine-grained localization of text-referred regions in large-scale RS scenes. Unlike traditional approaches, XeMap enables precise mapping of mid-scale semantic entities that are often overlooked in image-level or object-level methods. To achieve this, we introduce XeMap-Network, a novel architecture designed to handle the complexities of pixel-level cross-modal contextual referring mapping in RS. The network includes a fusion layer that applies self- and cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the interaction between text and image embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Scale Semantic Alignment (HMSA) module that aligns multiscale visual features with the text semantic vector, enabling precise multimodal matching across large-scale RS imagery. To support XeMap task, we provide a novel, annotated dataset, XeMap-set, specifically tailored for this task, overcoming the lack of XeMap datasets in RS imagery. XeMap-Network is evaluated in a zero-shot setting against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance. This highlights its effectiveness in accurately mapping referring regions and providing valuable insights for interpreting large-scale RS environments.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

In this work, we present the first head-to-head comparison of recent discrete optimization techniques for the problem of prompt inversion. We evaluate Greedy Coordinate Gradients (GCG), PEZ , Random Search, AutoDAN and BLIP2's image captioner across various evaluation metrics related to the quality of inverted prompts and the quality of the images generated by the inverted prompts. We find that focusing on the CLIP similarity between the inverted prompts and the ground truth image acts as a poor proxy for the similarity between ground truth image and the image generated by the inverted prompts. While the discrete optimizers effectively minimize their objectives, simply using responses from a well-trained captioner often leads to generated images that more closely resemble those produced by the original prompts.</p></details> | 11 Pages, 3 Figures |
| **[Classifier-to-Bias: Toward Unsupervised Automatic Bias Detection for Visual Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20902v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A person downloading a pre-trained model from the web should be aware of its biases. Existing approaches for bias identification rely on datasets containing labels for the task of interest, something that a non-expert may not have access to, or may not have the necessary resources to collect: this greatly limits the number of tasks where model biases can be identified. In this work, we present Classifier-to-Bias (C2B), the first bias discovery framework that works without access to any labeled data: it only relies on a textual description of the classification task to identify biases in the target classification model. This description is fed to a large language model to generate bias proposals and corresponding captions depicting biases together with task-specific target labels. A retrieval model collects images for those captions, which are then used to assess the accuracy of the model w.r.t. the given biases. C2B is training-free, does not require any annotations, has no constraints on the list of biases, and can be applied to any pre-trained model on any classification task. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show that C2B discovers biases beyond those of the original datasets and outperforms a recent state-of-the-art bias detection baseline that relies on task-specific annotations, being a promising first step toward addressing task-agnostic unsupervised bias detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

We find that spatial relations are generally rare in widely used VL datasets, with only a few being well represented, while most form a long tail of underrepresented relations. This gap leaves VLMs ill-equipped to handle diverse spatial relationships. To bridge it, we construct a synthetic VQA dataset focused on spatial reasoning generated from hyper-detailed image descriptions in Localized Narratives, DOCCI, and PixMo-Cap. Our dataset consists of 455k samples containing 3.4 million QA pairs. Trained on this dataset, our Spatial-Reasoning Enhanced (SpaRE) VLMs show strong improvements on spatial reasoning benchmarks, achieving up to a 49% performance gain on the What's Up benchmark, while maintaining strong results on general tasks. Our work narrows the gap between human and VLM spatial reasoning and makes VLMs more capable in real-world tasks such as robotics and navigation.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods struggle with fine-grained feature extraction, multimodal alignment, and generalization across diverse imaging types, often relying on vanilla transformers and focusing primarily on chest X-rays. We propose MicarVLMoE, a vision-language mixture-of-experts model with gated cross-aligned fusion, designed to address these limitations. Our architecture includes: (i) a multiscale vision encoder (MSVE) for capturing anatomical details at varying resolutions, (ii) a multihead dual-branch latent attention (MDLA) module for vision-language alignment through latent bottleneck representations, and (iii) a modulated mixture-of-experts (MoE) decoder for adaptive expert specialization. We extend MIR to CT scans, retinal imaging, MRI scans, and gross pathology images, reporting state-of-the-art results on COVCTR, MMR, PGROSS, and ROCO datasets.

Training on specialty-specific literature could yield high-performance, task-specific tools, enabling generative AI to match generalist models in specialty publishing, educational, and clinical tasks. We created NeuroPubs, a multimodal dataset of 23,000 Neurosurgery Publications articles (134M words, 78K image-caption pairs). Using NeuroPubs, VLMs generated publication-ready graphical abstracts (70% of 100 abstracts) and board-style questions indistinguishable from human-written ones (54% of 89,587 questions). We used these questions to train CNS-Obsidian, a 34B-parameter VLM. In a blinded, randomized controlled trial, our model demonstrated non-inferiority to then state-of-the-art GPT-4o in neurosurgical differential diagnosis (clinical utility, 40.62% upvotes vs. 57.89%, p=0.1150; accuracy, 59.38% vs. 65.79%, p=0.3797).

However, recently, language and multi-modal foundational models have been used to replace and scale-up human annotator's efforts. This study explores the similarity between human-generated and ML-generated annotations of images across diverse socio-economic contexts (RQ1) and their impact on ML model performance and bias (RQ2). We aim to understand differences in perception and identify potential biases in content interpretation. Our dataset comprises images of people from various geographical regions and income levels, covering various daily activities and home environments. ML captions and human labels show highest similarity at a low-level, i.e., types of words that appear and sentence structures, but all annotations are consistent in how they perceive images across regions. ML Captions resulted in best overall region classification performance, while ML Objects and ML Captions performed best overall for income regression. ML annotations worked best for action categories, while human input was more effective for non-action categories. These findings highlight the notion that both human and machine annotations are important, and that human-generated annotations are yet to be replaceable.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (including references), 5 figures, 5 tables, and a paper/ethics checklist.

We restrict our attention to surfaces without boundary, but allow for spontaneous curvature effects. The axisymmetric setting allows us to formulate our schemes in terms of the generating curve of the considered surface. We propose a novel weak formulation, that combines an evolution equation for the surface's mean curvature and the curvature identity of the generating curve. The mean curvature is used to describe the gradient flow structure, which enables an unconditional stability result for the discrete solutions. The generating curve's curvature, on the other hand, describes the surface's in-plane principal curvature and plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier for an equidistribution property on the discrete level. We introduce two fully discrete schemes and prove their unconditional stability. Numerical results are provided to confirm the convergence, stability and equidistribution properties of the introduced schemes.</p></details> |  |

Discussions on social media have described how engagements were lifesaving for some, but evidence suggests that general-purpose LLM chatbots also have notable risks that could endanger the welfare of users if not designed responsibly. In this study, we investigate the lived experiences of people who have used LLM chatbots for mental health support. We build on interviews with 21 individuals from globally diverse backgrounds to analyze how users create unique support roles for their chatbots, fill in gaps in everyday care, and navigate associated cultural limitations when seeking support from chatbots. We ground our analysis in psychotherapy literature around effective support, and introduce the concept of therapeutic alignment, or aligning AI with therapeutic values for mental health contexts. Our study offers recommendations for how designers can approach the ethical and effective use of LLM chatbots and other AI mental health support tools in mental health care.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work; typos corrected and post-review revisions incorporated</p></details> |

However, their heavy computation costs and model sizes are usually unacceptable in real-world deployment. Model quantization, an effective weight-lighting technique, has become an indispensable procedure in the whole deployment pipeline. The essence of quantization acceleration is the conversion from continuous floating-point numbers to discrete integer ones, which significantly speeds up the memory I/O and calculation, i.e., addition and multiplication. However, performance degradation also comes with the conversion because of the loss of precision. Therefore, it has become increasingly popular and critical to investigate how to perform the conversion and how to compensate for the information loss. This article surveys the recent five-year progress towards low-bit quantization on DNNs. We discuss and compare the state-of-the-art quantization methods and classify them into 8 main categories and 24 sub-categories according to their core techniques. Furthermore, we shed light on the potential research opportunities in the field of model quantization. A curated list of model quantization is provided at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/Awesome-Model-Quantization.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have systematically collected and reviewed the state-of-the-art quantization methods from the past five years, categorizing them into eight distinct groups.

RINS is a particular form of recursive depth that significantly outperforms +55 other variants, including the recent "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM (Liu et al., 2024) and latent recurrent thinking (Geiping et al., 2025). Unlike prior works, we carry out our comparisons on a compute-matched regime, and demonstrate that for a fixed model size and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. More importantly, with light-weight (linear) adapters (comprising <1% of model parameters) and stochastic dropout, RINS offers a no-regret strategy, meaning that RINS-enabled pretraining improves performance in language modeling even when recursive depth is not applied at inference time. This corresponds to improving performance on a training compute-, parameter-, and inference-matched regime, suggesting its potential as a viable component of LLM pretraining!</p></details> |  |

Still, existing deep learning-based methods often require significant computational costs to generate diverse stylized results. Motivated by this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based framework for arbitrary style transfer RLMiniStyler. This framework leverages a unified reinforcement learning policy to iteratively guide the style transfer process by exploring and exploiting stylization feedback, generating smooth sequences of stylized results while achieving model lightweight. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty-aware multi-task learning strategy that automatically adjusts loss weights to adapt to the content and style balance requirements at different training stages, thereby accelerating model convergence. Through a series of experiments across image various resolutions, we have validated the advantages of RLMiniStyler over other state-of-the-art methods in generating high-quality, diverse artistic image sequences at a lower cost.

| **[Light Weight CNN for classification of Brain Tumors from MRI Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21188v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for the multi-class classification of brain tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We utilize a publicly available dataset containing MRI images categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Our primary objective is to build a light weight deep learning model that can automatically classify brain tumor types with high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we incorporate image preprocessing steps, including normalization, data augmentation, and a cropping technique designed to reduce background noise and emphasize relevant regions. The CNN architecture is optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner, enabling systematic exploration of network parameters. To ensure reliable evaluation, we apply 5-fold cross-validation, where each hyperparameter configuration is evaluated across multiple data splits to mitigate overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.78%, indicating its potential as a diagnostic aid in clinical settings. The proposed method offers a low-complexity yet effective solution for assisting in early brain tumor diagnosis.</p></details> | 6 pages |

However, no general solution has yet been found against the unpredictable behavior of neural networks and reinforcement learning agents. Nevertheless, the improvements of photo-realistic simulators have paved the way towards extensive testing of complex algorithms in different virtual scenarios, which would be expensive and dangerous to implement in the real world. This paper presents SimPRIVE, a simulation framework for physical robot interaction with virtual environments, which operates as a vehicle-in-the-loop platform, rendering a virtual world while operating the vehicle in the real world. Using SimPRIVE, any physical mobile robot running on ROS 2 can easily be configured to move its digital twin in a virtual world built with the Unreal Engine 5 graphic engine, which can be populated with objects, people, or other vehicles with programmable behavior. SimPRIVE has been designed to accommodate custom or pre-built virtual worlds while being light-weight to contain execution times and allow fast rendering. Its main advantage lies in the possibility of testing complex algorithms on the full software and hardware stack while minimizing the risks and costs of a test campaign.

| **[Real-Time Image Segmentation via Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10413v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation is one of the most fundamental problems in computer vision and has drawn a lot of attention due to its vast applications in image understanding and autonomous driving. However, designing effective and efficient segmentation neural architectures is a labor-intensive process that may require numerous trials by human experts. In this paper, we address the challenge of integrating multi-head self-attention into high-resolution representation CNNs efficiently by leveraging architecture search. Manually replacing convolution layers with multi-head self-attention is non-trivial due to the costly overhead in memory to maintain high resolution. By contrast, we develop a multi-target multi-branch supernet method, which not only fully utilizes the advantages of high-resolution features but also finds the proper location for placing the multi-head self-attention module. Our search algorithm is optimized towards multiple objectives (e.g., latency and mIoU) and is capable of finding architectures on the Pareto frontier with an arbitrary number of branches in a single search. We further present a series of models via the Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search (HyCTAS) method that searches for the best hybrid combination of light-weight convolution layers and memory-efficient self-attention layers between branches from different resolutions and fuses them to high resolution for both efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyCTAS outperforms previous methods in both semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation tasks.

Given a horizontal partition of a table, a provenance sketch for a query Q records which fragments contain provenance. Once a provenance sketch has been captured for a query, it can be used to speed-up subsequent queries by skipping data that does not belong to a sketch. The size and, thus, also the effectiveness of a provenance sketch is often quite sensitive to the choice of attribute(s) we are partitioning on. In this work, we develop sample-based estimation techniques for the size of provenance sketches akin to a specialized form of approximate query processing. This technique enables the online selection of provenance sketches by estimating the size of sketches for a set of candidate attributes and then creating the sketch that is estimated to yield the largest benefit. We demonstrate experimentally that our estimation is accurate enough to select optimal or near optimal provenance sketches in most cases which in turn leads to a runtime improvement of up to %60 compared to other strategies for selecting provenance sketches.</p></details> |  |

Although they generate VMs with high-quality just-in-time (JIT) compilers, they still lack an important feature that dedicated VMs (i.e., VMs that are developed for specific languages) have, namely \emph{multi-tier compilation}. Multi-tier compilation uses light-weight compilers at early stages and highly-optimizing compilers at later stages in order to balance between compilation overheads and code quality. We propose a novel approach to enabling multi-tier compilation in the VMs generated by a meta-compiler framework. Instead of extending the JIT compiler backend of the framework, our approach drives an existing (heavyweight) compiler backend in the framework to quickly generate unoptimized native code by merely embedding directives and compile-time operations into interpreter definitions. As a validation of the approach, we developed 2SOM, a Simple Object Machine with a two-tier JIT compiler based on RPython. 2SOM first applies the tier-1 threaded code generator that is generated by our proposed technique, then, to the loops that exceed a threshold, applies the tier-2 tracing JIT compiler that is generated by the original RPython framework. Our performance evaluation that runs a program with a realistic workload showed that 2SOM improved, when compared against an RPython-based VM, warm-up performance by 15\%, with merely a 5\% reduction in peak performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECOOP...</summary><p>ECOOP 2025.

| **[Light Edge Fault Tolerant Graph Spanners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10890v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has recently been significant interest in fault tolerant spanners, which are spanners that still maintain their stretch guarantees after some nodes or edges fail. This work has culminated in an almost complete understanding of the three-way tradeoff between stretch, sparsity, and number of faults tolerated. However, despite some progress in metric settings, there have been no results to date on the tradeoff in general graphs between stretch, lightness, and number of faults tolerated. We initiate the study of light edge fault tolerant (EFT) graph spanners, obtaining the first such results. First, we observe that lightness can be unbounded if we use the traditional definition (normalizing by the MST). We then argue that a natural definition of fault-tolerant lightness is to instead normalize by a min-weight fault tolerant connectivity preserver; essentially, a fault-tolerant version of the MST. However, even with this, we show that it is still not generally possible to construct $f$-EFT spanners whose weight compares reasonably to the weight of a min-weight $f$-EFT connectivity preserver. In light of this lower bound, it is natural to then consider bicriteria notions of lightness, where we compare the weight of an $f$-EFT spanner to a min-weight $(f' > f)$-EFT connectivity preserver. The most interesting question is to determine the minimum value of $f'$ that allows for reasonable lightness upper bounds. Our main result is a precise answer to this question: $f' = 2f$. In particular, we show that the lightness can be untenably large (roughly $n/k$ for a $k$-spanner) if one normalizes by the min-weight $(2f-1)$-EFT connectivity preserver. But if one normalizes by the min-weight $2f$-EFT connectivity preserver, then we show that the lightness is bounded by just $O(f^{1/2})$ times the non-fault tolerant lightness (roughly $n^{1/k}$, for a $(1+\epsilon)(2k-1)$-spanner).</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared at ICALP 2025.

| **[MVQA: Mamba with Unified Sampling for Efficient Video Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16003v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of long-duration, high-definition videos has made efficient video quality assessment (VQA) a critical challenge. Existing research typically tackles this problem through two main strategies: reducing model parameters and resampling inputs. However, light-weight Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformers often struggle to balance efficiency with high performance due to the requirement of long-range modeling capabilities. Recently, the state-space model, particularly Mamba, has emerged as a promising alternative, offering linear complexity with respect to sequence length. Meanwhile, efficient VQA heavily depends on resampling long sequences to minimize computational costs, yet current resampling methods are often weak in preserving essential semantic information. In this work, we present MVQA, a Mamba-based model designed for efficient VQA along with a novel Unified Semantic and Distortion Sampling (USDS) approach. USDS combines semantic patch sampling from low-resolution videos and distortion patch sampling from original-resolution videos. The former captures semantically dense regions, while the latter retains critical distortion details. To prevent computation increase from dual inputs, we propose a fusion mechanism using pre-defined masks, enabling a unified sampling strategy that captures both semantic and quality information without additional computational burden. Experiments show that the proposed MVQA, equipped with USDS, achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while being $2\times$ as fast and requiring only $1/5$ GPU memory.</p></details> |  |

However, controlling these large models for image restoration usually requires a large number of high-quality images and immense computational resources for training, which is costly and not privacy-friendly. In this paper, we find that the well-trained large T2I model (i.e., Flux) is able to produce a variety of high-quality images aligned with real-world distributions, offering an unlimited supply of training samples to mitigate the above issue. Specifically, we proposed a training data construction pipeline for image restoration, namely FluxGen, which includes unconditional image generation, image selection, and degraded image simulation. A novel light-weighted adapter (FluxIR) with squeeze-and-excitation layers is also carefully designed to control the large Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based T2I model so that reasonable details can be restored. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method enables the Flux model to adapt effectively to real-world image restoration tasks, achieving superior scores and visual quality on both synthetic and real-world degradation datasets - at only about 8.5\% of the training cost compared to current approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[MoWE-Audio: Multitask AudioLLMs with Mixture of Weak Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06635v4)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced natural language processing capabilities, facilitating the development of AudioLLMs that process and understand speech and audio inputs alongside text. Existing AudioLLMs typically combine a pre-trained audio encoder with a pre-trained LLM, which are subsequently finetuned on specific audio tasks. However, the pre-trained audio encoder has constrained capacity to capture features for new tasks and datasets. To address this, we propose to incorporate mixtures of `weak' encoders (MoWE) into the AudioLLM framework. MoWE supplements a base encoder with a pool of relatively light weight encoders, selectively activated based on the audio input to enhance feature extraction without significantly increasing model size. Our empirical results demonstrate that MoWE effectively improves multi-task performance, broadening the applicability of AudioLLMs to more diverse audio tasks.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 |

In this paper, we introduced Med-2D SegNet, a novel and highly efficient segmentation architecture that delivers outstanding accuracy while maintaining a minimal computational footprint. Med-2D SegNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including KVASIR-SEG, PH2, EndoVis, and GLAS, with an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 89.77% across 20 diverse datasets. Central to its success is the compact Med Block, a specialized encoder design that incorporates dimension expansion and parameter reduction, enabling precise feature extraction while keeping model parameters to a low count of just 2.07 million. Med-2D SegNet excels in cross-dataset generalization, particularly in polyp segmentation, where it was trained on KVASIR-SEG and showed strong performance on unseen datasets, demonstrating its robustness in zero-shot learning scenarios, even though we acknowledge that further improvements are possible. With top-tier performance in both binary and multi-class segmentation, Med-2D SegNet redefines the balance between accuracy and efficiency, setting a new benchmark for medical image analysis. This work paves the way for developing accessible, high-performance diagnostic tools suitable for clinical environments and resource-constrained settings, making it a step forward in the democratization of advanced medical technology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Consistency Distillation for Accelerated Human Image Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11143v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in human image animation have been propelled by video diffusion models, yet their reliance on numerous iterative denoising steps results in high inference costs and slow speeds. An intuitive solution involves adopting consistency models, which serve as an effective acceleration paradigm through consistency distillation. However, simply employing this strategy in human image animation often leads to quality decline, including visual blurring, motion degradation, and facial distortion, particularly in dynamic regions. In this paper, we propose the DanceLCM approach complemented by several enhancements to improve visual quality and motion continuity at low-step regime: (1) segmented consistency distillation with an auxiliary light-weight head to incorporate supervision from real video latents, mitigating cumulative errors resulting from single full-trajectory generation; (2) a motion-focused loss to centre on motion regions, and explicit injection of facial fidelity features to improve face authenticity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DanceLCM achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art video diffusion models with a mere 2-4 inference steps, significantly reducing the inference burden without compromising video quality. The code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compass Control: Multi Object Orientation Control for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06752v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches for controlling text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, do not allow for explicit 3D object-centric control, such as precise control of object orientation. In this work, we address the problem of multi-object orientation control in text-to-image diffusion models. This enables the generation of diverse multi-object scenes with precise orientation control for each object. The key idea is to condition the diffusion model with a set of orientation-aware \textbf{compass} tokens, one for each object, along with text tokens. A light-weight encoder network predicts these compass tokens taking object orientation as the input. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset of procedurally generated scenes, each containing one or two 3D assets on a plain background. However, direct training this framework results in poor orientation control as well as leads to entanglement among objects. To mitigate this, we intervene in the generation process and constrain the cross-attention maps of each compass token to its corresponding object regions. The trained model is able to achieve precise orientation control for a) complex objects not seen during training and b) multi-object scenes with more than two objects, indicating strong generalization capabilities. Further, when combined with personalization methods, our method precisely controls the orientation of the new object in diverse contexts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art orientation control and text alignment, quantified with extensive evaluations and a user study.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Camera Ready.

The ASCON family, a NIST finalist in lightweight cryptography standards, is known for its simplistic yet resilient design, making it well-suited for resource-constrained environments characterized by limited processing capabilities and energy reservoirs. This study focuses on understanding the integration and assessment of the ASCON encryption algorithm in UAV networks, emphasizing its potential as a lightweight and efficient cryptographic solution. The research objectives aim to evaluate ASCON variants' effectiveness in providing security comparable to AES-128 while exhibiting lower computational cost and energy consumption within simulated UAV network environments. Comparative analysis assesses performance metrics such as encryption and decryption speeds, resource utilization, and resistance to cryptographic vulnerabilities against established algorithms like AES. Performance metrics, including peak and average execution times, overall throughput, and security properties against various cryptographic attacks, are measured and analysed to determine the most suitable cryptographic algorithm for UAV communication systems. Performance results indicate that ASCON-128a as the optimal choice for UAV communication systems requiring a balance between efficiency and security. Its superior performance metrics, robust security properties, and suitability for resource-constrained environments position it as the preferred solution for securing UAV communication networks. By leveraging the strengths of ASCON-128a, UAV communication systems can achieve optimal performance and security, ensuring reliable and secure communication in challenging operational environments.</p></details> |  |

Current exemplar replay strategies impose $\mathcal{O}(t)$ memory/compute complexities. We propose an autoencoder-based hybrid replay (AHR) strategy that leverages our new hybrid autoencoder (HAE) to function as a compressor to alleviate the requirement for large memory, achieving $\mathcal{O}(0.1 t)$ at the worst case with the computing complexity of $\mathcal{O}(t)$ while accomplishing state-of-the-art performance. The decoder later recovers the exemplar data stored in the latent space, rather than in raw format. Additionally, HAE is designed for both discriminative and generative modeling, enabling classification and replay capabilities, respectively. HAE adopts the charged particle system energy minimization equations and repulsive force algorithm for the incremental embedding and distribution of new class centroids in its latent space. Our results demonstrate that AHR consistently outperforms recent baselines across multiple benchmarks while operating with the same memory/compute budgets. The source code is included in the supplementary material and will be open-sourced upon publication.</p></details> | Accepted ICML 2025 |
| **[Semantic Shift Estimation via Dual-Projection and Classifier Reconstruction for Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05423v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to sequentially learn from distinct categories without retaining exemplars but easily suffers from catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. While existing EFCIL methods leverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two critical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the embeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks, and the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with new data, thereby hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate classifier training as a reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits previous information encoded in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, across various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, the rapid growth of computational tasks involving WSIs poses significant challenges. Given that WSIs are gigapixels in size, they present difficulties in terms of storage, processing, and model training. Therefore, it is essential to develop lifelong learning approaches for WSI analysis. In scenarios where slides are distributed across multiple institutes, we aim to leverage them to develop a unified online model as a computational tool for cancer diagnosis in clinical and hospital settings. In this study, we introduce ADaFGrad, a method designed to enhance lifelong learning for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis. First, we leverage pathology vision-language foundation models to develop a framework that enables interaction between a slide's regional tissue features and a predefined text-based prototype buffer. Additionally, we propose a gradient-distillation mechanism that mimics the gradient of a logit with respect to the classification-head parameters across past and current iterations in a continual-learning setting. We construct a sequence of six TCGA datasets for training and evaluation. Experimental results show that ADaFGrad outperforms both state-of-the-art WSI-specific and conventional continual-learning methods after only a few training epochs, exceeding them by up to +5.068% in the class-incremental learning scenario while exhibiting the least forgetting (i.e., retaining the most knowledge from previous tasks). Moreover, ADaFGrad surpasses its baseline by as much as +40.084% in accuracy, further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Additive Parameter Updates of Vision Transformers for Few-Shot Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08982v2)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating new class information without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence, often referred to as catastrophic forgetting. Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) addresses this by first training a model on a robust dataset of base classes and then incrementally adapting it in successive sessions using only a few labeled examples per novel class. However, this approach is prone to overfitting on the limited new data, which can compromise overall performance and exacerbate forgetting. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective novel FSCIL framework that leverages a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone augmented with parameter-efficient additive updates. Our approach freezes the pre-trained ViT parameters and selectively injects trainable weights into the self-attention modules via an additive update mechanism. This design updates only a small subset of parameters to accommodate new classes without sacrificing the representations learned during the base session. By fine-tuning a limited number of parameters, our method preserves the generalizable features in the frozen ViT while reducing the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, as most parameters remain fixed, the model avoids overwriting previously learned knowledge when small novel data batches are introduced. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach yields state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline FSCIL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[SacFL: Self-Adaptive Federated Continual Learning for Resource-Constrained End Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00365v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm, wherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data generated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by continuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device models. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling machine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is unsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this context, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution, preserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative updates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor autonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial tasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and task-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining lightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices. Moreover, $\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an autonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new task has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately allows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without additional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and THUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\rm{SacFL}$ in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios. Furthermore, a demo system has been developed to verify its practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TNNLS 2025</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) has emerged, focusing on continuous learning of new categories with limited samples without forgetting old knowledge. Existing FSCIL studies typically use a single model to learn knowledge across all sessions, inevitably leading to the stability-plasticity dilemma. Unlike machines, humans store varied knowledge in different cerebral cortices. Inspired by this characteristic, our paper aims to develop a method that learns independent models for each session. It can inherently prevent catastrophic forgetting. During the testing stage, our method integrates Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for model deployment. Our method provides a fresh viewpoint for FSCIL and demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100 and mini-ImageNet datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inclusive Training Separation and Implicit Knowledge Interaction for Balanced Online Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20566v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online class-incremental learning (OCIL) focuses on gradually learning new classes (called plasticity) from a stream of data in a single-pass, while concurrently preserving knowledge of previously learned classes (called stability). The primary challenge in OCIL lies in maintaining a good balance between the knowledge of old and new classes within the continually updated model. Most existing methods rely on explicit knowledge interaction through experience replay, and often employ exclusive training separation to address bias problems. Nevertheless, it still remains a big challenge to achieve a well-balanced learner, as these methods often exhibit either reduced plasticity or limited stability due to difficulties in continually integrating knowledge in the OCIL setting. In this paper, we propose a novel replay-based method, called Balanced Online Incremental Learning (BOIL), which can achieve both high plasticity and stability, thus ensuring more balanced performance in OCIL. Our BOIL method proposes an inclusive training separation strategy using dual classifiers so that knowledge from both old and new classes can effectively be integrated into the model, while introducing implicit approaches for transferring knowledge across the two classifiers. Extensive experimental evaluations over three widely-used OCIL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of BOIL, showing more balanced yet better performance compared to state-of-the-art replay-based OCIL methods.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Dynamic Integration of Task-Specific Adapters for Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14983v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-exemplar class Incremental Learning (NECIL) enables models to continuously acquire new classes without retraining from scratch and storing old task exemplars, addressing privacy and storage issues. However, the absence of data from earlier tasks exacerbates the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in NECIL. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Integration of task-specific Adapters (DIA), which comprises two key components: Task-Specific Adapter Integration (TSAI) and Patch-Level Model Alignment. TSAI boosts compositionality through a patch-level adapter integration strategy, which provides a more flexible compositional solution while maintaining low computation costs. Patch-Level Model Alignment maintains feature consistency and accurate decision boundaries via two specialized mechanisms: Patch-Level Distillation Loss (PDL) and Patch-Level Feature Reconstruction method (PFR). Specifically, the PDL preserves feature-level consistency between successive models by implementing a distillation loss based on the contributions of patch tokens to new class learning. The PFR facilitates accurate classifier alignment by reconstructing old class features from previous tasks that adapt to new task knowledge. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our DIA, revealing significant improvements on benchmark datasets in the NECIL setting, maintaining an optimal balance between computational complexity and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperparameters in Continual Learning: A Reality Check](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09066v4)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) aims to train a model on a sequence of tasks (i.e., a CL scenario) while balancing the trade-off between plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (retaining prior knowledge). The dominantly adopted conventional evaluation protocol for CL algorithms selects the best hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, mini-batch size, regularization strengths, etc.) within a given scenario and then evaluates the algorithms using these hyperparameters in the same scenario. However, this protocol has significant shortcomings: it overestimates the CL capacity of algorithms and relies on unrealistic hyperparameter tuning, which is not feasible for real-world applications. From the fundamental principles of evaluation in machine learning, we argue that the evaluation of CL algorithms should focus on assessing the generalizability of their CL capacity to unseen scenarios. Based on this, we propose the Generalizable Two-phase Evaluation Protocol (GTEP) consisting of hyperparameter tuning and evaluation phases. Both phases share the same scenario configuration (e.g., number of tasks) but are generated from different datasets. Hyperparameters of CL algorithms are tuned in the first phase and applied in the second phase to evaluate the algorithms. We apply this protocol to class-incremental learning, both with and without pretrained models. Across more than 8,000 experiments, our results show that most state-of-the-art algorithms fail to replicate their reported performance, highlighting that their CL capacity has been significantly overestimated in the conventional evaluation protocol. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/csm9493/GTEP.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |
| **[Enhancing Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning through Neural Collapse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18437v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) is a critical capability for real-world applications, enabling learning systems to adapt to new tasks while retaining knowledge from previous ones. Recent advancements in pre-trained models (PTMs) have significantly advanced the field of CIL, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods. However, understanding how features evolve and are distributed across incremental tasks remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to modeling feature evolution in PTM-based CIL through the lens of neural collapse (NC), a striking phenomenon observed in the final phase of training, which leads to a well-separated, equiangular feature space. We explore the connection between NC and CIL effectiveness, showing that aligning feature distributions with the NC geometry enhances the ability to capture the dynamic behavior of continual learning. Based on this insight, we introduce Neural Collapse-inspired Pre-Trained Model-based CIL (NCPTM-CIL), a method that dynamically adjusts the feature space to conform to the elegant NC structure, thereby enhancing the continual learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCPTM-CIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets. Notably, when initialized with ViT-B/16-IN1K, NCPTM-CIL surpasses the runner-up method by 6.73% on VTAB, 1.25% on CIFAR-100, and 2.5% on OmniBenchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noise-Tolerant Coreset-Based Class Incremental Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16763v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications of computer vision require the ability to adapt to novel data distributions after deployment. Adaptation requires algorithms capable of continual learning (CL). Continual learners must be plastic to adapt to novel tasks while minimizing forgetting of previous tasks.However, CL opens up avenues for noise to enter the training pipeline and disrupt the CL. This work focuses on label noise and instance noise in the context of class-incremental learning (CIL), where new classes are added to a classifier over time, and there is no access to external data from past classes. We aim to understand the sensitivity of CL methods that work by replaying items from a memory constructed using the idea of Coresets. We derive a new bound for the robustness of such a method to uncorrelated instance noise under a general additive noise threat model, revealing several insights. Putting the theory into practice, we create two continual learning algorithms to construct noise-tolerant replay buffers. We empirically compare the effectiveness of prior memory-based continual learners and the proposed algorithms under label and uncorrelated instance noise on five diverse datasets. We show that existing memory-based CL are not robust whereas the proposed methods exhibit significant improvements in maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing forgetting in the noisy CIL setting.</p></details> | Work-in-Progress |
| **[Audio-Visual Class-Incremental Learning for Fish Feeding intensity Assessment in Aquaculture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15171v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fish Feeding Intensity Assessment (FFIA) is crucial in industrial aquaculture management. Recent multi-modal approaches have shown promise in improving FFIA robustness and efficiency. However, these methods face significant challenges when adapting to new fish species or environments due to catastrophic forgetting and the lack of suitable datasets. To address these limitations, we first introduce AV-CIL-FFIA, a new dataset comprising 81,932 labelled audio-visual clips capturing feeding intensities across six different fish species in real aquaculture environments. Then, we pioneer audio-visual class incremental learning (CIL) for FFIA and demonstrate through benchmarking on AV-CIL-FFIA that it significantly outperforms single-modality methods. Existing CIL methods rely heavily on historical data. Exemplar-based approaches store raw samples, creating storage challenges, while exemplar-free methods avoid data storage but struggle to distinguish subtle feeding intensity variations across different fish species. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HAIL-FFIA, a novel audio-visual class-incremental learning framework that bridges this gap with a prototype-based approach that achieves exemplar-free efficiency while preserving essential knowledge through compact feature representations. Specifically, HAIL-FFIA employs hierarchical representation learning with a dual-path knowledge preservation mechanism that separates general intensity knowledge from fish-specific characteristics. Additionally, it features a dynamic modality balancing system that adaptively adjusts the importance of audio versus visual information based on feeding behaviour stages. Experimental results show that HAIL-FFIA is superior to SOTA methods on AV-CIL-FFIA, achieving higher accuracy with lower storage needs while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting in incremental fish species learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-parametric Memory Consolidation: Towards Brain-like Deep Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14727v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans and most animals inherently possess a distinctive capacity to continually acquire novel experiences and accumulate worldly knowledge over time. This ability, termed continual learning, is also critical for deep neural networks (DNNs) to adapt to the dynamically evolving world in open environments. However, DNNs notoriously suffer from catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge when trained on sequential tasks. In this work, inspired by the interactive human memory and learning system, we propose a novel biomimetic continual learning framework that integrates semi-parametric memory and the wake-sleep consolidation mechanism. For the first time, our method enables deep neural networks to retain high performance on novel tasks while maintaining prior knowledge in real-world challenging continual learning scenarios, e.g., class-incremental learning on ImageNet. This study demonstrates that emulating biological intelligence provides a promising path to enable deep neural networks with continual learning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEGA: Second-Order Gradient Alignment for Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation in GFSCIL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13691v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (GFSCIL) enables models to continually learn from limited samples of novel tasks after initial training on a large base dataset. Existing GFSCIL approaches typically utilize Prototypical Networks (PNs) for metric-based class representations and fine-tune the model during the incremental learning stage. However, these PN-based methods oversimplify learning via novel query set fine-tuning and fail to integrate Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques due to architectural constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a more rigorous and practical setting for GFSCIL that excludes query sets during the incremental training phase. Building on this foundation, we introduce Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning (MEGA), aimed at effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting for GFSCIL. Specifically, by calculating the incremental second-order gradient during the meta-training stage, we endow the model to learn high-quality priors that enhance incremental learning by aligning its behaviors across both the meta-training and incremental learning stages. Extensive experiments on four mainstream graph datasets demonstrate that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art results and enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in GFSCIL. We believe that our proposed MEGA serves as a model-agnostic GFSCIL paradigm, paving the way for future research.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Feature Calibration enhanced Parameter Synthesis for CLIP-based Class-incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18672v4)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new class knowledge while retaining previous classes, facilitating adaptation and evolution in dynamic, real-world environments. Traditional CIL methods primarily rely on visual features, which limits their effectiveness in complex, multimodal scenarios. In contrast, VLMs show promising potential for enhancing CIL by leveraging pre-trained knowledge and integrating multi-modal semantic cues such as text and vision. However, existing approaches struggle to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while preserving the generalization strengths of VLMs across diverse modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a Feature Calibration Enhanced Parameter Synthesis (FCPS) framework. Specifically, FCPS introduces a dynamic parameter adjustment mechanism that iteratively calibrates the contribution of original visual features to the final class decision, thus preserving the model's intrinsic generalization capability across modalities. Simultaneously, parameter integration enables effective knowledge transfer, maintaining a balance between acquiring new class representations and preserving old knowledge. Experimental results on popular benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR100 and ImageNet100) validate the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Decision Boundary for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10976v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously learn new classes from a limited set of training samples without forgetting knowledge of previously learned classes. Conventional FSCIL methods typically build a robust feature extractor during the base training session with abundant training samples and subsequently freeze this extractor, only fine-tuning the classifier in subsequent incremental phases. However, current strategies primarily focus on preventing catastrophic forgetting, considering only the relationship between novel and base classes, without paying attention to the specific decision spaces of each class. To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play Adaptive Decision Boundary Strategy (ADBS), which is compatible with most FSCIL methods. Specifically, we assign a specific decision boundary to each class and adaptively adjust these boundaries during training to optimally refine the decision spaces for the classes in each session. Furthermore, to amplify the distinctiveness between classes, we employ a novel inter-class constraint loss that optimizes the decision boundaries and prototypes for each class. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, namely CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CUB200, demonstrate that incorporating our ADBS method with existing FSCIL techniques significantly improves performance, achieving overall state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-ACL: Closed-Form Solution for Time Series-oriented Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15954v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification underpins critical applications such as healthcare diagnostics and gesture-driven interactive systems in multimedia scenarios. However, time series class-incremental learning (TSCIL) faces two major challenges: catastrophic forgetting and intra-class variations. Catastrophic forgetting occurs because gradient-based parameter update strategies inevitably erase past knowledge. And unlike images, time series data exhibits subject-specific patterns, also known as intra-class variations, which refer to differences in patterns observed within the same class. While exemplar-based methods fail to cover diverse variation with limited samples, existing exemplar-free methods lack explicit mechanisms to handle intra-class variations. To address these two challenges, we propose TS-ACL, which leverages a gradient-free closed-form solution to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem inherent in gradient-based optimization methods while simultaneously learning global distributions to resolve intra-class variations. Additionally, it provides privacy protection and efficiency. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets covering various sensor modalities and tasks demonstrate that TS-ACL achieves performance close to joint training on four datasets, outperforming existing methods and establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for TSCIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[GPS: Distilling Compact Memories via Grid-based Patch Sampling for Efficient Online Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10409v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online class-incremental learning aims to enable models to continuously adapt to new classes with limited access to past data, while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Replay-based methods address this by maintaining a small memory buffer of previous samples, achieving competitive performance. For effective replay under constrained storage, recent approaches leverage distilled data to enhance the informativeness of memory. However, such approaches often involve significant computational overhead due to the use of bi-level optimization. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce Grid-based Patch Sampling (GPS), a lightweight and effective strategy for distilling informative memory samples without relying on a trainable model. GPS generates informative samples by sampling a subset of pixels from the original image, yielding compact low-resolution representations that preserve both semantic content and structural information. During replay, these representations are reassembled to support training and evaluation. Experiments on extensive benchmarks demonstrate that GRS can be seamlessly integrated into existing replay frameworks, leading to 3%-4% improvements in average end accuracy under memory-constrained settings, with limited computational overhead.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Continual learning for rotating machinery fault diagnosis with cross-domain environmental and operational variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10151v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although numerous machine learning models exist to detect issues like rolling bearing strain and deformation, typically caused by improper mounting, overloading, or poor lubrication, these models often struggle to isolate faults from the noise of real-world operational and environmental variability. Conditions such as variable loads, high temperatures, stress, and rotational speeds can mask early signs of failure, making reliable detection challenging. To address these limitations, this work proposes a continual deep learning approach capable of learning across domains that share underlying structure over time. This approach goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics by addressing four second-order challenges: catastrophic forgetting (where new learning overwrites past knowledge), lack of plasticity (where models fail to adapt to new data), forward transfer (using past knowledge to improve future learning), and backward transfer (refining past knowledge with insights from new domains). The method comprises a feature generator and domain-specific classifiers, allowing capacity to grow as new domains emerge with minimal interference, while an experience replay mechanism selectively revisits prior domains to mitigate forgetting. Moreover, nonlinear dependencies across domains are exploited by prioritizing replay from those with the highest prior errors, refining models based on most informative past experiences. Experiments show high average domain accuracy (up to 88.96%), with forgetting measures as low as .0027 across non-stationary class-incremental environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[CFSSeg: Closed-Form Solution for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation of 2D Images and 3D Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10834v2)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>2D images and 3D point clouds are foundational data types for multimedia applications, including real-time video analysis, augmented reality (AR), and 3D scene understanding. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CSS) requires incrementally learning new semantic categories while retaining prior knowledge. Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive training based on stochastic gradient descent, employing complex regularization or exemplar replay. However, stochastic gradient descent-based approaches inevitably update the model's weights for past knowledge, leading to catastrophic forgetting, a problem exacerbated by pixel/point-level granularity. To address these challenges, we propose CFSSeg, a novel exemplar-free approach that leverages a closed-form solution, offering a practical and theoretically grounded solution for continual semantic segmentation tasks. This eliminates the need for iterative gradient-based optimization and storage of past data, requiring only a single pass through new samples per step. It not only enhances computational efficiency but also provides a practical solution for dynamic, privacy-sensitive multimedia environments. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D benchmark datasets such as Pascal VOC2012, S3DIS, and ScanNet demonstrate CFSSeg's superior performance.</p></details> |  |
