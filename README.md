| **[Molecular Signal Reception in Complex Vessel Networks: The Role of the Network Topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15943v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The notion of synthetic molecular communication (MC) refers to the transmission of information via molecules and is largely foreseen for use within the human body, where traditional electromagnetic wave (EM)-based communication is impractical. MC is anticipated to enable innovative medical applications, such as early-stage tumor detection, targeted drug delivery, and holistic approaches like the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). Many of these applications involve parts of the human cardiovascular system (CVS), here referred to as networks, posing challenges for MC due to their complex, highly branched vessel structures. To gain a better understanding of how the topology of such branched vessel networks affects the reception of a molecular signal at a target location, e.g., the network outlet, we present a generic analytical end-to-end model that characterizes molecule propagation and reception in linear branched vessel networks (LBVNs). We specialize this generic model to any MC system employing superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as signaling molecules and a planar coil as receiver (RX). By considering components that have been previously established in testbeds, we effectively isolate the impact of the network topology and validate our theoretical model with testbed data. Additionally, we propose two metrics, namely the molecule delay and the multi-path spread, that relate the LBVN topology to the molecule dispersion induced by the network, thereby linking the network structure to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the target location. This allows the characterization of the SNR at any point in the network solely based on the network topology. Consequently, our framework can, e.g., be exploited for optimal sensor placement in the CVS or identification of suitable testbed topologies for given SNR requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted for presentation at IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2025; Added index terms and funding footnote, relaxed spacing, introduced notion of molecule flux in Eq.

| **[Towards A Universal Graph Structural Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10917v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large-scale pre-training have shown the potential to learn generalizable representations for downstream tasks. In the graph domain, however, capturing and transferring structural information across different graph domains remains challenging, primarily due to the inherent differences in topological patterns across various contexts. Additionally, most existing models struggle to capture the complexity of rich graph structures, leading to inadequate exploration of the embedding space. To address these challenges, we propose GFSE, a universal graph structural encoder designed to capture transferable structural patterns across diverse domains such as molecular graphs, social networks, and citation networks. GFSE is the first cross-domain graph structural encoder pre-trained with multiple self-supervised learning objectives. Built on a Graph Transformer, GFSE incorporates attention mechanisms informed by graph inductive bias, enabling it to encode intricate multi-level and fine-grained topological features. The pre-trained GFSE produces generic and theoretically expressive positional and structural encoding for graphs, which can be seamlessly integrated with various downstream graph feature encoders, including graph neural networks for vectorized features and Large Language Models for text-attributed graphs. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate GFSE's capability to significantly enhance the model's performance while requiring substantially less task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, GFSE achieves state-of-the-art performance in 81.6% evaluated cases, spanning diverse graph models and datasets, highlighting its potential as a powerful and versatile encoder for graph-structured data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting ionic conductivity in solids from the machine-learned potential energy landscape](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06804v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering new superionic materials is essential for advancing solid-state batteries, which offer improved energy density and safety compared to the traditional lithium-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes. Conventional computational methods for identifying such materials are resource-intensive and not easily scalable. Recently, universal interatomic potential models have been developed using equivariant graph neural networks. These models are trained on extensive datasets of first-principles force and energy calculations. One can achieve significant computational advantages by leveraging them as the foundation for traditional methods of assessing the ionic conductivity, such as molecular dynamics or nudged elastic band techniques. However, the generalization error from model inference on diverse atomic structures arising in such calculations can compromise the reliability of the results. In this work, we propose an approach for the quick and reliable screening of ionic conductors through the analysis of a universal interatomic potential. Our method incorporates a set of heuristic structure descriptors that effectively employ the rich knowledge of the underlying model while requiring minimal generalization capabilities. Using our descriptors, we rank lithium-containing materials in the Materials Project database according to their expected ionic conductivity. Eight out of the ten highest-ranked materials are confirmed to be superionic at room temperature in first-principles calculations. Notably, our method achieves a speed-up factor of approximately 50 compared to molecular dynamics driven by a machine-learning potential, and is at least 3,000 times faster compared to first-principles molecular dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Large...</summary><p>Larger-scale AIMD validation of our predictions; minor text updates.

| **[Optimizing Data Distribution and Kernel Performance for Efficient Training of Chemistry Foundation Models: A Case Study with MACE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10700v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemistry Foundation Models (CFMs) that leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) operating on 3D molecular graph structures are becoming indispensable tools for computational chemists and materials scientists. These models facilitate the understanding of matter and the discovery of new molecules and materials. In contrast to GNNs operating on a large homogeneous graphs, GNNs used by CFMs process a large number of geometric graphs of varying sizes, requiring different optimization strategies than those developed for large homogeneous GNNs. This paper presents optimizations for two critical phases of CFM training: data distribution and model training, targeting MACE - a state-of-the-art CFM. We address the challenge of load balancing in data distribution by formulating it as a multi-objective bin packing problem. We propose an iterative algorithm that provides a highly effective, fast, and practical solution, ensuring efficient data distribution. For the training phase, we identify symmetric tensor contraction as the key computational kernel in MACE and optimize this kernel to improve the overall performance. Our combined approach of balanced data distribution and kernel optimization significantly enhances the training process of MACE. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial speedup, reducing per-epoch execution time for training from 12 to 2 minutes on 740 GPUs with a 2.6M sample dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 34th ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC 2025)</p></details> |

Our approach integrates: (1) stochastic reaction-diffusion systems modeling molecular signaling, (2) neural-like electrochemical communication with Hebbian plasticity, and (3) a biologically informed reward function combining chemical gradient tracking, neural synchronization, and robust penalties. A curriculum learning scheme guides the agent through progressively complex repair scenarios. In silico experiments demonstrate emergent repair strategies, including dynamic secretion control and spatial coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, submitted to the 10th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology for Intelligent Systems (ICTIS)</p></details> |
| **[JanusDDG: A Thermodynamics-Compliant Model for Sequence-Based Protein Stability via Two-Fronts Multi-Head Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03278v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how residue variations affect protein stability is crucial for designing functional proteins and deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying disease-related mutations. Recent advances in protein language models (PLMs) have revolutionized computational protein analysis, enabling, among other things, more accurate predictions of mutational effects. In this work, we introduce JanusDDG, a deep learning framework that leverages PLM-derived embeddings and a bidirectional cross-attention transformer architecture to predict $\Delta \Delta G$ of single and multiple-residue mutations while simultaneously being constrained to respect fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as antisymmetry and transitivity. Unlike conventional self-attention, JanusDDG computes queries (Q) and values (V) as the difference between wild-type and mutant embeddings, while keys (K) alternate between the two. This cross-interleaved attention mechanism enables the model to capture mutation-induced perturbations while preserving essential contextual information. Experimental results show that JanusDDG achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting $\Delta \Delta G$ from sequence alone, matching or exceeding the accuracy of structure-based methods for both single and multiple mutations.

| **[Finding Pathways in Reaction Networks guided by Energy Barriers using Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10609v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing synthesis pathways for target molecules in a chemical reaction network annotated with information on the kinetics of individual reactions is an area of active study. This work presents a computational methodology for searching for pathways in reaction networks which is based on integer linear programming and the modeling of reaction networks by directed hypergraphs. Often multiple pathways fit the given search criteria. To rank them, we develop an objective function based on physical arguments maximizing the probability of the pathway. We furthermore develop an automated pipeline to estimate the energy barriers of individual reactions in reaction networks. Combined, the methodology facilitates flexible and kinetically informed pathway investigations on large reaction networks by computational means, even for networks coming without kinetic annotation, such as those created via generative approaches for expanding molecular spaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain-Adversarial Neural Network and Explainable AI for Reducing Tissue-of-Origin Signal in Pan-cancer Mortality Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10343v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tissue-of-origin signals dominate pan-cancer gene expression, often obscuring molecular features linked to patient survival. This hampers the discovery of generalizable biomarkers, as models tend to overfit tissue-specific patterns rather than capture survival-relevant signals. To address this, we propose a Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) trained on TCGA RNA-seq data to learn representations less biased by tissue and more focused on survival. Identifying tissue-independent genetic profiles is key to revealing core cancer programs. We assess the DANN using: (1) Standard SHAP, based on the original input space and DANN's mortality classifier; (2) A layer-aware strategy applied to hidden activations, including an unsupervised manifold from raw activations and a supervised manifold from mortality-specific SHAP values. Standard SHAP remains confounded by tissue signals due to biases inherent in its computation. The raw activation manifold was dominated by high-magnitude activations, which masked subtle tissue and mortality-related signals. In contrast, the layer-aware SHAP manifold offers improved low-dimensional representations of both tissue and mortality signals, independent of activation strength, enabling subpopulation stratification and pan-cancer identification of survival-associated genes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molecular Learning Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10560v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We apply the physics-learning duality to molecular systems by complementing the physical description of interacting particles with a dual learning description, where each particle is modeled as an agent minimizing a loss function. In the traditional physics framework, the equations of motion are derived from the Lagrangian function, while in the learning framework, the same equations emerge from learning dynamics driven by the agent loss function. The loss function depends on scalar quantities that describe invariant properties of all other agents or particles. To demonstrate this approach, we first infer the loss functions of oxygen and hydrogen directly from a dataset generated by the CP2K physics-based simulation of water molecules. We then employ the loss functions to develop a learning-based simulation of water molecules, which achieves comparable accuracy while being significantly more computationally efficient than standard physics-based simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[RetroGFN: Diverse and Feasible Retrosynthesis using GFlowNets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18739v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-step retrosynthesis aims to predict a set of reactions that lead to the creation of a target molecule, which is a crucial task in molecular discovery. Although a target molecule can often be synthesized with multiple different reactions, it is not clear how to verify the feasibility of a reaction, because the available datasets cover only a tiny fraction of the possible solutions. Consequently, the existing models are not encouraged to explore the space of possible reactions sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel single-step retrosynthesis model, RetroGFN, that can explore outside the limited dataset and return a diverse set of feasible reactions by leveraging a feasibility proxy model during the training. We show that RetroGFN achieves competitive results on standard top-k accuracy while outperforming existing methods on round-trip accuracy. Moreover, we provide empirical arguments in favor of using round-trip accuracy, which expands the notion of feasibility with respect to the standard top-k accuracy metric.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph ODEs and Beyond: A Comprehensive Survey on Integrating Differential Equations with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23167v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and differential equations (DEs) are two rapidly advancing areas of research that have shown remarkable synergy in recent years. GNNs have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, while differential equations provide a principled framework for modeling continuous dynamics across time and space. The intersection of these fields has led to innovative approaches that leverage the strengths of both, enabling applications in physics-informed learning, spatiotemporal modeling, and scientific computing. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the burgeoning research at the intersection of GNNs and DEs. We will categorize existing methods, discuss their underlying principles, and highlight their applications across domains such as molecular modeling, traffic prediction, and epidemic spreading. Furthermore, we identify open challenges and outline future research directions to advance this interdisciplinary field. A comprehensive paper list is provided at https://github.com/Emory-Melody/Awesome-Graph-NDEs. This survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand and contribute to the fusion of GNNs and DEs</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Bayesian non-parametric spatial modeling for cross-sample identification of spatially variable genes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09654v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized tissue analysis by simultaneously mapping gene expression, spatial topography, and histological context across consecutive tissue sections, enabling systematic investigation of spatial heterogeneity. The detection of spatially variable (SV) genes-molecular signatures with position-dependent expression-provides critical insights into disease mechanisms spanning oncology, neurology, and cardiovascular research. Current methodologies, however, confront dual constraints: predominant reliance on predefined spatial pattern templates restricts detection of novel complex spatial architectures, and inconsistent sample selection strategies compromise analytical stability and biological interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical framework incorporating non-parametric spatial modeling and across-sample integration. It takes advantage of the non-parametric technique and develops an adaptive spatial process accommodating complex pattern discovery. A novel cross-sample bi-level shrinkage prior is further introduced for robust multi-sample SV gene detection, facilitating more effective information fusion. An efficient variational inference is developed for posterior inference ensuring computational scalability. This architecture synergistically addresses spatial complexity through adaptive pattern learning while maintaining biological interpretability. Comprehensive simulations and empirical analyzes confirm the improved performance of the proposed method in resolving complex spatial expression patterns compared to existing analytical frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal integration of chemical structures improves representations of microscopy images for morphological profiling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09544v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in self-supervised deep learning have improved our ability to quantify cellular morphological changes in high-throughput microscopy screens, a process known as morphological profiling. However, most current methods only learn from images, despite many screens being inherently multimodal, as they involve both a chemical or genetic perturbation as well as an image-based readout. We hypothesized that incorporating chemical compound structure during self-supervised pre-training could improve learned representations of images in high-throughput microscopy screens. We introduce a representation learning framework, MICON (Molecular-Image Contrastive Learning), that models chemical compounds as treatments that induce counterfactual transformations of cell phenotypes. MICON significantly outperforms classical hand-crafted features such as CellProfiler and existing deep-learning-based representation learning methods in challenging evaluation settings where models must identify reproducible effects of drugs across independent replicates and data-generating centers. We demonstrate that incorporating chemical compound information into the learning process provides consistent improvements in our evaluation setting and that modeling compounds specifically as treatments in a causal framework outperforms approaches that directly align images and compounds in a single representation space. Our findings point to a new direction for representation learning in morphological profiling, suggesting that methods should explicitly account for the multimodal nature of microscopy screening data.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[MolGround: A Benchmark for Molecular Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23668v3)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current molecular understanding approaches predominantly focus on the descriptive aspect of human perception, providing broad, topic-level insights. However, the referential aspect -- linking molecular concepts to specific structural components -- remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a molecular grounding benchmark designed to evaluate a model's referential abilities. We align molecular grounding with established conventions in NLP, cheminformatics, and molecular science, showcasing the potential of NLP techniques to advance molecular understanding within the AI for Science movement. Furthermore, we constructed the largest molecular understanding benchmark to date, comprising 117k QA pairs, and developed a multi-agent grounding prototype as proof of concept. This system outperforms existing models, including GPT-4o, and its grounding outputs have been integrated to enhance traditional tasks such as molecular captioning and ATC (Anatomical, Therapeutic, Chemical) classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[BioChemInsight: An Open-Source Toolkit for Automated Identification and Recognition of Optical Chemical Structures and Activity Data in Scientific Publications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10525v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated extraction of chemical structures and their bioactivity data is crucial for accelerating drug discovery and enabling data-driven pharmaceutical research. Existing optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) tools fail to autonomously associate molecular structures with their bioactivity profiles, creating a critical bottleneck in structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis. Here, we present BioChemInsight, an open-source pipeline that integrates: (1) DECIMER Segmentation and MolVec for chemical structure recognition, (2) Qwen2.5-VL-32B for compound identifier association, and (3) PaddleOCR with Gemini-2.0-flash for bioactivity extraction and unit normalization. We evaluated the performance of BioChemInsight on 25 patents and 17 articles. BioChemInsight achieved 95% accuracy for tabular patent data (structure/identifier recognition), with lower accuracy in non-tabular patents (~80% structures, ~75% identifiers), plus 92.2 % bioactivity extraction accuracy. For articles, it attained >99% identifiers and 78-80% structure accuracy in non-tabular formats, plus 97.4% bioactivity extraction accuracy. The system generates ready-to-use SAR datasets, reducing data preprocessing time from weeks to hours while enabling applications in high-throughput screening and ML-driven drug design (https://github.com/dahuilangda/BioChemInsight).</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Efficient Biological Data Acquisition through Inference Set Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19631v4)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In drug discovery, highly automated high-throughput laboratories are used to screen a large number of compounds in search of effective drugs. These experiments are expensive, so one might hope to reduce their cost by only experimenting on a subset of the compounds, and predicting the outcomes of the remaining experiments. In this work, we model this scenario as a sequential subset selection problem: we aim to select the smallest set of candidates in order to achieve some desired level of accuracy for the system as a whole. Our key observation is that, if there is heterogeneity in the difficulty of the prediction problem across the input space, selectively obtaining the labels for the hardest examples in the acquisition pool will leave only the relatively easy examples to remain in the inference set, leading to better overall system performance. We call this mechanism inference set design, and propose the use of a confidence-based active learning solution to prune out these challenging examples. Our algorithm includes an explicit stopping criterion that interrupts the acquisition loop when it is sufficiently confident that the system has reached the target performance. Our empirical studies on image and molecular datasets, as well as a real-world large-scale biological assay, show that active learning for inference set design leads to significant reduction in experimental cost while retaining high system performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScaffoldGPT: A Scaffold-based GPT Model for Drug Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06891v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug optimization has become increasingly crucial in light of fast-mutating virus strains and drug-resistant cancer cells. Nevertheless, it remains challenging as it necessitates retaining the beneficial properties of the original drug while simultaneously enhancing desired attributes beyond its scope. In this work, we aim to tackle this challenge by introducing ScaffoldGPT, a novel Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) designed for drug optimization based on molecular scaffolds. Our work comprises three key components: (1) A three-stage drug optimization approach that integrates pretraining, finetuning, and decoding optimization. (2) A uniquely designed two-phase incremental training approach for pre-training the drug optimization GPT on molecule scaffold with enhanced performance. (3) A token-level decoding optimization strategy, TOP-N, that enabling controlled, reward-guided generation using pretrained/finetuned GPT. We demonstrate via a comprehensive evaluation on COVID and cancer benchmarks that ScaffoldGPT outperforms the competing baselines in drug optimization benchmarks, while excelling in preserving original functional scaffold and enhancing desired properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[PolyConf: Unlocking Polymer Conformation Generation through Hierarchical Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08859v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polymer conformation generation is a critical task that enables atomic-level studies of diverse polymer materials. While significant advances have been made in designing various conformation generation methods for small molecules and proteins, these methods struggle to generate polymer conformations due to polymers' unique structural characteristics. The scarcity of polymer conformation datasets further limits progress, making this promising area largely unexplored. In this work, we propose PolyConf, a pioneering tailored polymer conformation generation method that leverages hierarchical generative models to unlock new possibilities for this task. Specifically, we decompose the polymer conformation into a series of local conformations (i.e., the conformations of its repeating units), generating these local conformations through an autoregressive model. We then generate corresponding orientation transformations via a diffusion model to assemble these local conformations into the complete polymer conformation. Moreover, we develop the first benchmark with a high-quality polymer conformation dataset derived from molecular dynamics simulations to boost related research in this area. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PolyConf consistently generates high-quality polymer conformations, facilitating advancements in polymer modeling and simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Persistent Stiefel-Whitney Classes of Tangent Bundles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15854v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stiefel-Whitney classes are invariants of the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold, represented as cohomology classes of the base manifold. These classes are essential in obstruction theory, embedding problems, and cobordism theory. In this work, we first reestablish an appropriate notion of vector bundles in a persistent setting, allowing characteristic classes to be interpreted through topological data analysis. Next, we propose a concrete algorithm to compute persistent cohomology classes that represent the Stiefel-Whitney classes of the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold. Given a point cloud, we construct a \v{C}ech or alpha filtration. By applying the Wu formula in this setting, we derive a sequence of persistent cohomology classes from the filtration. We show that if the filtration is homotopy equivalent to a smooth manifold, then one of these persistent cohomology classes corresponds to the $k$-th Stiefel-Whitney class of the tangent bundle of that manifold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present experiments on real-world datasets, including applications to complex manifolds, image patches, and molecular conformation space.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures.

We systematically explore their applications, strengths, and limitations, offering a comprehensive review and an up-to-date pipeline of recent advancements.

| **[Efficient Fine-Tuning of Single-Cell Foundation Models Enables Zero-Shot Molecular Perturbation Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13478v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting transcriptional responses to novel drugs provides a unique opportunity to accelerate biomedical research and advance drug discovery efforts. However, the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of cellular responses, combined with the extremely limited available experimental data, makes the task challenging. In this study, we leverage single-cell foundation models (FMs) pre-trained on tens of millions of single cells, encompassing multiple cell types, states, and disease annotations, to address molecular perturbation prediction. We introduce a drug-conditional adapter that allows efficient fine-tuning by training less than 1% of the original foundation model, thus enabling molecular conditioning while preserving the rich biological representation learned during pre-training. The proposed strategy allows not only the prediction of cellular responses to novel drugs, but also the zero-shot generalization to unseen cell lines. We establish a robust evaluation framework to assess model performance across different generalization tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results across all settings, with significant improvements in the few-shot and zero-shot generalization to new cell lines compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce Compositional Generative Flows (CGFlow), a novel framework that extends flow matching to generate objects in compositional steps while modeling continuous states. Our key insight is that modeling compositional state transitions can be formulated as a straightforward extension of the flow matching interpolation process. We further build upon the theoretical foundations of generative flow networks (GFlowNets), enabling reward-guided sampling of compositional structures. We apply CGFlow to synthesizable drug design by jointly designing the molecule's synthetic pathway with its 3D binding pose. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art binding affinity on all 15 targets from the LIT-PCBA benchmark, and 5.8$\times$ improvement in sampling efficiency compared to 2D synthesis-based baseline. To our best knowledge, our method is also the first to achieve state of-art-performance in both Vina Dock (-9.38) and AiZynth success rate (62.2\%) on the CrossDocked benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlighted at ICLR 2025 GEM and AI4Mat workshops, 29 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets and established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with respect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most comprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the honey bee (Apis mellifera), an ecologically vital pollinator. We evaluate ApisTox using a diverse suite of machine learning approaches, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as well as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical space. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as ApisTox, demonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art algorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for more diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the agrochemical domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[GOLLuM: Gaussian Process Optimized LLMs -- Reframing LLM Finetuning through Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06265v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can encode complex relationships in their latent spaces, yet harnessing them for optimization under uncertainty remains challenging. We address this gap with a novel architecture that reframes LLM finetuning as Gaussian process (GP) marginal likelihood optimization via deep kernel methods. We introduce LLM-based deep kernels, jointly optimized with GPs to preserve the benefits of both - LLMs to provide a rich and flexible input space for Bayesian optimization and - GPs to model this space with predictive uncertainty for more efficient sampling. Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reaction optimization, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-performing reactions compared to static LLM embeddings (from 24% to 43% coverage of the top 5% reactions in just 50 optimization iterations). We also observe a 14% improvement over domain-specific representations without requiring specialized features. Extensive empirical evaluation across 19 benchmarks - ranging from general chemistry to reaction and molecular property optimization - demonstrates our method's robustness, generality, and consistent improvements across: (1) tasks, (2) LLM architectures (encoder, decoder, encoder-decoder), (3) pretraining domains (chemistry-related or general-purpose) and (4) hyperparameter settings (tuned once on a single dataset). Finally, we explain these improvements: joint LLM-GP optimization through marginal likelihood implicitly performs contrastive learning, aligning representations to produce (1) better-structured embedding spaces, (2) improved uncertainty calibration, and (3) more efficient sampling - without requiring any external loss. This work provides both practical advances in sample-efficient optimization and insights into what makes effective Bayesian optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Fusion of Deep Learned Molecular Embeddings for Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07297v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven approaches such as deep learning can result in predictive models for material properties with exceptional accuracy and efficiency. However, in many problems data is sparse, severely limiting their accuracy and applicability. To improve predictions, techniques such as transfer learning and multi-task learning have been used. The performance of multi-task learning models depends on the strength of the underlying correlations between tasks and the completeness of the dataset. We find that standard multi-task models tend to underperform when trained on sparse datasets with weakly correlated properties. To address this gap, we use data fusion techniques to combine the learned molecular embeddings of various single-task models and trained a multi-task model on this combined embedding. We apply this technique to a widely used benchmark dataset of quantum chemistry data for small molecules as well as a newly compiled sparse dataset of experimental data collected from literature and our own quantum chemistry and thermochemical calculations. The results show that the fused, multi-task models outperform standard multi-task models for sparse datasets and can provide enhanced prediction on data-limited properties compared to single-task models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparative Performance Evaluation of Large Language Models for Extracting Molecular Interactions and Pathway Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08813v3)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background Identification of the interactions and regulatory relations between biomolecules play pivotal roles in understanding complex biological systems and the mechanisms underlying diverse biological functions. However, the collection of such molecular interactions has heavily relied on expert curation in the past, making it labor-intensive and time-consuming. To mitigate these challenges, we propose leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to automate genome-scale extraction of this crucial knowledge. Results In this study, we investigate the efficacy of various LLMs in addressing biological tasks, such as the recognition of protein interactions, identification of genes linked to pathways affected by low-dose radiation, and the delineation of gene regulatory relationships. Overall, the larger models exhibited superior performance, indicating their potential for specific tasks that involve the extraction of complex interactions among genes and proteins. Although these models possessed detailed information for distinct gene and protein groups, they faced challenges in identifying groups with diverse functions and in recognizing highly correlated gene regulatory relationships. Conclusions By conducting a comprehensive assessment of the state-of-the-art models using well-established molecular interaction and pathway databases, our study reveals that LLMs can identify genes/proteins associated with pathways of interest and predict their interactions to a certain extent. Furthermore, these models can provide important insights, marking a noteworthy stride toward advancing our understanding of biological systems through AI-assisted knowledge discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Equivariant Non-Local Electron Density Functionals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07972v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accuracy of density functional theory hinges on the approximation of non-local contributions to the exchange-correlation (XC) functional. To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). Where previous works relied on semi-local functionals or fixed-size descriptors of the density, we compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud for efficient non-local atomic-range interactions. By applying an equivariant GNN on this point cloud, we capture molecular-range interactions in a scalable and accurate manner. To train EG-XC, we differentiate through a self-consistent field solver requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Representation Learning, 2025</p></details> |

However, while performing well at capturing distributions of molecular motifs, they often produce synthetically inaccessible molecules. To address this, we introduce SynFlowNet, a GFlowNet model whose action space uses chemical reactions and purchasable reactants to sequentially build new molecules. By incorporating forward synthesis as an explicit constraint of the generative mechanism, we aim at bridging the gap between in silico molecular generation and real world synthesis capabilities. We evaluate our approach using synthetic accessibility scores and an independent retrosynthesis tool to assess the synthesizability of our compounds, and motivate the choice of GFlowNets through considerable improvement in sample diversity compared to baselines. Additionally, we identify challenges with reaction encodings that can complicate traversal of the MDP in the backward direction. To address this, we introduce various strategies for learning the GFlowNet backward policy and thus demonstrate how additional constraints can be integrated into the GFlowNet MDP framework. This approach enables our model to successfully identify synthesis pathways for previously unseen molecules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bio2Token: All-atom tokenization of any biomolecular structure with Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19110v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient encoding and representation of large 3D molecular structures with high fidelity is critical for biomolecular design applications. Despite this, many representation learning approaches restrict themselves to modeling smaller systems or use coarse-grained approximations of the systems, for example modeling proteins at the resolution of amino acid residues rather than at the level of individual atoms. To address this, we develop quantized auto-encoders that learn atom-level tokenizations of complete proteins, RNA and small molecule structures with reconstruction accuracies well below 1 Angstrom. We demonstrate that a simple Mamba state space model architecture is efficient compared to an SE(3)-invariant IPA architecture, reaches competitive accuracies and can scale to systems with almost 100,000 atoms. The learned structure tokens of bio2token may serve as the input for all-atom generative models in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[TxGemma: Efficient and Agentic LLMs for Therapeutics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06196v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Therapeutic development is a costly and high-risk endeavor that is often plagued by high failure rates. To address this, we introduce TxGemma, a suite of efficient, generalist large language models (LLMs) capable of therapeutic property prediction as well as interactive reasoning and explainability. Unlike task-specific models, TxGemma synthesizes information from diverse sources, enabling broad application across the therapeutic development pipeline. The suite includes 2B, 9B, and 27B parameter models, fine-tuned from Gemma-2 on a comprehensive dataset of small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, diseases, and cell lines. Across 66 therapeutic development tasks, TxGemma achieved superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art generalist model on 64 (superior on 45), and against state-of-the-art specialist models on 50 (superior on 26). Fine-tuning TxGemma models on therapeutic downstream tasks, such as clinical trial adverse event prediction, requires less training data than fine-tuning base LLMs, making TxGemma suitable for data-limited applications. Beyond these predictive capabilities, TxGemma features conversational models that bridge the gap between general LLMs and specialized property predictors. These allow scientists to interact in natural language, provide mechanistic reasoning for predictions based on molecular structure, and engage in scientific discussions. Building on this, we further introduce Agentic-Tx, a generalist therapeutic agentic system powered by Gemini 2.5 that reasons, acts, manages diverse workflows, and acquires external domain knowledge. Agentic-Tx surpasses prior leading models on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark (Chemistry & Biology) with 52.3% relative improvement over o3-mini (high) and 26.7% over o3-mini (high) on GPQA (Chemistry) and excels with improvements of 6.3% (ChemBench-Preference) and 2.4% (ChemBench-Mini) over o3-mini (high).</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Substructure-Aware Expert Model for Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05844v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular property prediction is essential for applications such as drug discovery and toxicity assessment. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results by modeling molecules as molecular graphs, their reliance on data-driven learning limits their ability to generalize, particularly in the presence of data imbalance and diverse molecular substructures. Existing methods often overlook the varying contributions of different substructures to molecular properties, treating them uniformly. To address these challenges, we propose ASE-Mol, a novel GNN-based framework that leverages a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for molecular property prediction. ASE-Mol incorporates BRICS decomposition and significant substructure awareness to dynamically identify positive and negative substructures. By integrating a MoE architecture, it reduces the adverse impact of negative motifs while improving adaptability to positive motifs. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASE-Mol achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in both accuracy and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Controlled Generation from Language Models with Adaptive Weighted Rejection Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05410v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some constraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens at each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this is achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding non-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i) Evaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM vocabularies often exceed $100,000$ tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global distribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information, even if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm that addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on the full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive rejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer constraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to produce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small additional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously proposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior of local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in text-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON domains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines, supporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and performance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that our method's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation, scaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and as a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models are In-Context Molecule Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04197v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in biochemical tasks, especially the molecule caption translation task, which aims to bridge the gap between molecules and natural language texts. However, previous methods in adapting LLMs to the molecule-caption translation task required extra domain-specific pre-training stages, suffered weak alignment between molecular and textual spaces, or imposed stringent demands on the scale of LLMs. To resolve the challenges, we propose In-Context Molecule Adaptation (ICMA), as a new paradigm allowing LLMs to learn the molecule-text alignment from context examples via In-Context Molecule Tuning. Specifically, ICMA incorporates the following three stages: Hybrid Context Retrieval, Post-retrieval Re-ranking, and In-context Molecule Tuning. Initially, Hybrid Context Retrieval utilizes BM25 Caption Retrieval and Molecule Graph Retrieval to retrieve similar informative context examples. Additionally, Post-retrieval Re-ranking is composed of Sequence Reversal and Random Walk selection to further improve the quality of retrieval results. Finally, In-Context Molecule Tuning unlocks the in-context learning and reasoning capability of LLMs with the retrieved examples and adapts the parameters of LLMs for better alignment between molecules and texts. Experimental results demonstrate that ICMA can empower LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art or comparable performance without extra training corpora and intricate structures, showing that LLMs are inherently in-context molecule learners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TKDE</p></details> |
| **[Bidirectional Hierarchical Protein Multi-Modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04770v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks. Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural information. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Through extensive experiments on a diverse set of protein-related tasks, our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including react (enzyme/EC classification), model quality assessment (MQA), protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (LBA), protein-protein binding site prediction (PPBS), and B cell epitopes prediction (BCEs). Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of BIHIERARCHICAL FUSION in bridging sequence and structural modalities.</p></details> |  |

While existing sequence-based approaches leverage molecular fingerprints or graph representations, they critically overlook three-dimensional (3D) structural determinants of binding affinity. To bridge this gap, we present EquiCPI, an end-to-end geometric deep learning framework that synergizes first-principles structural modeling with SE(3)-equivariant neural networks. Our pipeline transforms raw sequences into 3D atomic coordinates via ESMFold for proteins and DiffDock-L for ligands, followed by physics-guided conformer re-ranking and equivariant feature learning. At its core, EquiCPI employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing over atomic point clouds, preserving symmetry under rotations, translations, and reflections, while hierarchically encoding local interaction patterns through tensor products of spherical harmonics. The proposed model is evaluated on BindingDB (affinity prediction) and DUD-E (virtual screening), EquiCPI achieves performance on par with or exceeding the state-of-the-art deep learning competitors.</p></details> |  |

However, we discover that in the field of drug chemistry, certain tail classes exhibit higher identifiability during training due to their unique molecular structural features, a finding that significantly contrasts with the conventional understanding that tail classes are generally difficult to identify. Existing imbalance learning methods, such as resampling and cost-sensitive reweighting, overly rely on sample quantity priors, causing models to excessively focus on tail classes at the expense of head class performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that breaks away from the traditional static evaluation paradigm based on sample size. Instead, we establish a dynamical inter-class separability metric using feature distances between different classes. Specifically, we employ a sub-clustering contrastive learning approach to thoroughly learn the embedding features of each class, and we dynamically compute the distances between class embeddings to capture the relative positional evolution of samples from different classes in the feature space, thereby rebalancing the weights of the classification loss function. We conducted experiments on multiple existing long-tailed drug datasets and achieved competitive results by improving the accuracy of tail classes without compromising the performance of dominant classes.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a computational methodology for searching for pathways in reaction networks which is based on integer linear programming and the modeling of reaction networks by directed hypergraphs. Often multiple pathways fit the given search criteria. To rank them, we develop an objective function based on physical arguments maximizing the probability of the pathway. We furthermore develop an automated pipeline to estimate the energy barriers of individual reactions in reaction networks. Combined, the methodology facilitates flexible and kinetically informed pathway investigations on large reaction networks by computational means, even for networks coming without kinetic annotation, such as those created via generative approaches for expanding molecular spaces.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent studies, which demonstrate that diffusion model, a prominent generative approach, can learn meaningful data representations that enhance predictive tasks, we explore the potential for developing a unified generative model in the molecular domain that effectively addresses both molecular generation and property prediction tasks. However, the integration of these tasks is challenging due to inherent inconsistencies, making simple multi-task learning ineffective. To address this, we propose UniGEM, the first unified model to successfully integrate molecular generation and property prediction, delivering superior performance in both tasks. Our key innovation lies in a novel two-phase generative process, where predictive tasks are activated in the later stages, after the molecular scaffold is formed. We further enhance task balance through innovative training strategies. Rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in both tasks. The principles behind UniGEM hold promise for broader applications, including natural language processing and computer vision.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Unified Latent Space for 3D Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15567v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[De Novo Molecular Design Enabled by Direct Preference Optimization and Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01389v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>De novo molecular design has extensive applications in drug discovery and materials science. The vast chemical space renders direct molecular searches computationally prohibitive, while traditional experimental screening is both time- and labor-intensive. Efficient molecular generation and screening methods are therefore essential for accelerating drug discovery and reducing costs. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to optimize molecular properties via reward mechanisms, its practical utility is limited by issues in training efficiency, convergence, and stability. To address these challenges, we adopt Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) from NLP, which uses molecular score-based sample pairs to maximize the likelihood difference between high- and low-quality molecules, effectively guiding the model toward better compounds. Moreover, integrating curriculum learning further boosts training efficiency and accelerates convergence. A systematic evaluation of the proposed method on the GuacaMol Benchmark yielded excellent scores. For instance, the method achieved a score of 0.883 on the Perindopril MPO task, representing a 6\% improvement over competing models. And subsequent target protein binding experiments confirmed its practical efficacy. These results demonstrate the strong potential of DPO for molecular design tasks and highlight its effectiveness as a robust and efficient solution for data-driven drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[GENERator: A Long-Context Generative Genomic Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07272v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have significantly improved our ability to decode genomic sequences. However, the prediction and interpretation of these sequences remain challenging due to the intricate nature of genetic material. Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for biological sequence analysis. Recent developments in genomic language models have underscored the potential of LLMs in deciphering DNA sequences. Nonetheless, existing models often face limitations in robustness and application scope, primarily due to constraints in model structure and training data scale. To address these limitations, we present GENERator, a generative genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 98k base pairs (bp) and 1.2B parameters. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386B bp of eukaryotic DNA, the GENERator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both established and newly proposed benchmarks. The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology, accurately generating protein-coding sequences that translate into proteins structurally analogous to known families. It also shows significant promise in sequence optimization, particularly through the prompt-responsive generation of enhancer sequences with specific activity profiles. These capabilities position the GENERator as a pivotal tool for genomic research and biotechnological advancement, enhancing our ability to interpret and predict complex biological systems and enabling precise genomic interventions.

While recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of all-atom foundation models for molecular modeling and generation, existing approaches face challenges in generalization due to the multi-modal nature of atomic data and the lack of comprehensive analysis of training and sampling strategies. To address these limitations, we propose PharMolixFM, a unified framework for constructing all-atom foundation models based on multi-modal generative techniques. Our framework includes three variants using state-of-the-art multi-modal generative models. By formulating molecular tasks as a generalized denoising process with task-specific priors, PharMolixFM achieves robust performance across various structural biology applications. Experimental results demonstrate that PharMolixFM-Diff achieves competitive prediction accuracy in protein-small-molecule docking (83.9% vs. 90.2% RMSD < 2{\AA}, given pocket) with significantly improved inference speed. Moreover, we explore the empirical inference scaling law by introducing more sampling repeats or steps. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/PharMolix/OpenBioMed.</p></details> |  |
| **[GP-MoLFormer: A Foundation Model For Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04912v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models trained on large and general purpose datasets consisting of molecular strings have recently emerged as a powerful tool for successfully modeling various structure-property relations. Inspired by this success, we extend the paradigm of training chemical language transformers on large-scale chemical datasets to generative tasks in this work. Specifically, we propose GP-MoLFormer, an autoregressive molecular string generator that is trained on more than 1.1B (billion) chemical SMILES. GP-MoLFormer uses a 46.8M parameter transformer decoder model with linear attention and rotary positional encodings as the base architecture. GP-MoLFormer's utility is evaluated and compared with that of existing baselines on three different tasks: de novo generation, scaffold-constrained molecular decoration, and unconstrained property-guided optimization. While the first two are handled with no additional training, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for the last task, which uses property-ordered molecular pairs as input. We call this new approach pair-tuning. Our results show GP-MoLFormer performs better or comparable with baselines across all three tasks, demonstrating its general utility for a variety of molecular generation tasks. We further report strong memorization of training data in GP-MoLFormer generations, which has so far remained unexplored for chemical language models. Our analyses reveal that training data memorization and novelty in generations are impacted by the quality and scale of the training data; duplication bias in training data can enhance memorization at the cost of lowering novelty. We further establish a scaling law relating inference compute and novelty in generations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Make Autoregressive Great Again: Diffusion-Free Graph Generation with Next-Scale Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23612v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models are popular generative models due to their speed and properties. However, they require an explicit sequence order, which contradicts the unordered nature of graphs. In contrast, diffusion models maintain permutation invariance and enable one-shot generation but require up to thousands of denoising steps and additional features, leading to high computational costs. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in image generation-especially the success of visual autoregressive methods-we propose MAG, a novel diffusion-free graph generation framework based on next-scale prediction. By leveraging a hierarchy of latent representations, the model progressively generates scales of the entire graph without the need for explicit node ordering. Extensive experiments on both generic and molecular graph datasets demonstrate that MAG delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to three orders of magnitude in speedup during inference.</p></details> | Draft #1 |
| **[Fast Direct: Query-Efficient Online Black-box Guidance for Diffusion-model Target Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01692v5)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guided diffusion-model generation is a promising direction for customizing the generation process of a pre-trained diffusion model to address specific downstream tasks. Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/kimyong95/guide-stable-diffusion/tree/fast-direct</p></details> |  |

However, existing SBDD methods often overlook two key challenges: (1) the multi-modal nature of this task and (2) the causal relationship between these modalities, limiting their plausibility and performance. To address both challenges, we propose TransDiffSBDD, an integrated framework combining autoregressive transformers and diffusion models for SBDD. Specifically, the autoregressive transformer models discrete molecular information, while the diffusion model samples continuous distributions, effectively resolving the first challenge. To address the second challenge, we design a hybrid-modal sequence for protein-ligand complexes that explicitly respects the causality between modalities. Experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark demonstrate that TransDiffSBDD outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pretraining Generative Flow Networks with Inexpensive Rewards for Molecular Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06337v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have recently emerged as a suitable framework for generating diverse and high-quality molecular structures by learning from rewards treated as unnormalized distributions. Previous works in this framework often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on a subset of ZINC dataset, and by employing robust evaluation metrics we show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods for a wide range of drug design tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.09702</p></details> |

Existing generative methods are restricted to single-domain molecules, failing to address versatile therapeutic needs or utilize cross-domain transferability to enhance model performance. In this paper, we introduce Unified generative Modeling of 3D Molecules (UniMoMo), the first framework capable of designing binders of multiple molecular domains using a single model. In particular, UniMoMo unifies the representations of different molecules as graphs of blocks, where each block corresponds to either a standard amino acid or a molecular fragment. Based on these unified representations, UniMoMo utilizes a geometric latent diffusion model for 3D molecular generation, featuring an iterative full-atom autoencoder to compress blocks into latent space points, followed by an E(3)-equivariant diffusion process. Extensive benchmarks across peptides, antibodies, and small molecules demonstrate the superiority of our unified framework over existing domain-specific models, highlighting the benefits of multi-domain training.</p></details> | preprint |

While chemical Language Models (cLMs) have made strides in learning molecular properties, most fail to incorporate target-specific insights, restricting their ability to drive de-novo ligand generation. Chem42, a cutting-edge family of generative chemical Language Models, is designed to bridge this gap. By integrating atomic-level interactions with multimodal inputs from Prot42, a complementary protein Language Model, Chem42 achieves a sophisticated cross-modal representation of molecular structures, interactions, and binding patterns. This innovative framework enables the creation of structurally valid, synthetically accessible ligands with enhanced target specificity. Evaluations across diverse protein targets confirm that Chem42 surpasses existing approaches in chemical validity, target-aware design, and predicted binding affinity. By reducing the search space of viable drug candidates, Chem42 could accelerate the drug discovery pipeline, offering a powerful generative AI tool for precision medicine. Our Chem42 models set a new benchmark in molecule property prediction, conditional molecule generation, and target-aware ligand design.

| **[Potential Score Matching: Debiasing Molecular Structure Sampling with Potential Energy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14569v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Despite their widespread occurrence, there remains a gap in modeling particle propagation through these complex structures from a molecular communication (MC) perspective. This paper introduces a generalized analytical framework for modeling diffusion-based molecular communication in multi-layered spherical environments. The framework is capable of supporting an arbitrary number of layers and flexible transmitter-receiver positioning. As an example, the detailed formulation is presented for the three-layer sphere, which is particularly relevant for different biological models such as tumor spheroids. The analytical results are validated using particle-based simulation (PBS) in scenarios that have short inter-layer distances. The findings reveal that the characteristics of each layer significantly impact molecule propagation throughout the entire structure, making their consideration crucial for designing targeted therapies and optimizing drug delivery systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; accepted to be presented in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Communication</p></details> |
| **[A Reinforcement Learning-Driven Transformer GAN for Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12796v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating molecules with desired chemical properties presents a critical challenge in fields such as chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have significantly contributed to data-driven molecular generation. However, challenges persist due to the inherent sensitivity of simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) representations and the difficulties in applying generative adversarial networks (GANs) to discrete data. This study introduces RL-MolGAN, a novel Transformer-based discrete GAN framework designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional Transformer architectures, RL-MolGAN utilizes a first-decoder-then-encoder structure, facilitating the generation of drug-like molecules from both $de~novo$ and scaffold-based designs. In addition, RL-MolGAN integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) techniques to enhance the stability of GAN training and optimize the chemical properties of the generated molecules. To further improve the model's performance, RL-MolWGAN, an extension of RL-MolGAN, incorporates Wasserstein distance and mini-batch discrimination, which together enhance the stability of the GAN. Experimental results on two widely used molecular datasets, QM9 and ZINC, validate the effectiveness of our models in generating high-quality molecular structures with diverse and desirable chemical properties.</p></details> |  |

Designed to support AI-driven drug design and discovery, M$^{3}$-20M is 71 times more in the number of molecules than the largest existing dataset, providing an unprecedented scale that can highly benefit the training or fine-tuning of models, including large language models for drug design and discovery tasks. This dataset integrates one-dimensional SMILES, two-dimensional molecular graphs, three-dimensional molecular structures, physicochemical properties, and textual descriptions collected through web crawling and generated using GPT-3.5, offering a comprehensive view of each molecule. To demonstrate the power of M$^{3}$-20M in drug design and discovery, we conduct extensive experiments on two key tasks: molecule generation and molecular property prediction, using large language models including GLM4, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama3-8b. Our experimental results show that M$^{3}$-20M can significantly boost model performance in both tasks. Specifically, it enables the models to generate more diverse and valid molecular structures and achieve higher property prediction accuracy than existing single-modal datasets, which validates the value and potential of M$^{3}$-20M in supporting AI-driven drug design and discovery.

| **[Probabilistic Graph Circuits: Deep Generative Models for Tractable Probabilistic Inference over Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12162v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models (DGMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in capturing complex probability distributions over graphs. Although their excellent performance is attributed to powerful and scalable deep neural networks, it is, at the same time, exactly the presence of these highly non-linear transformations that makes DGMs intractable. Indeed, despite representing probability distributions, intractable DGMs deny probabilistic foundations by their inability to answer even the most basic inference queries without approximations or design choices specific to a very narrow range of queries. To address this limitation, we propose probabilistic graph circuits (PGCs), a framework of tractable DGMs that provide exact and efficient probabilistic inference over (arbitrary parts of) graphs. Nonetheless, achieving both exactness and efficiency is challenging in the permutation-invariant setting of graphs. We design PGCs that are inherently invariant and satisfy these two requirements, yet at the cost of low expressive power. Therefore, we investigate two alternative strategies to achieve the invariance: the first sacrifices the efficiency, and the second sacrifices the exactness. We demonstrate that ignoring the permutation invariance can have severe consequences in anomaly detection, and that the latter approach is competitive with, and sometimes better than, existing intractable DGMs in the context of molecular graph generation.</p></details> |  |

While these pesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning applications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or regression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular structures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Pesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders, designed to create pesticide candidates with optimized properties for the first time. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an initial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure representation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates toxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple toxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity to generate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Notably, Pesti-Gen achieves approximately 68\% structural validity in generating new molecular structures, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in producing optimized and feasible pesticide candidates, thereby providing a new way for safer and more sustainable pest management solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the RECOMB 2025 Poster Track</p></details> |

This success is largely attributed to the effectiveness of molecular tokenization strategies. In protein science, the amino acid sequence serves as the sole tokenizer for LLMs. However, many fundamental challenges in protein science are inherently structure-dependent. The absence of structure-aware tokens significantly limits the capabilities of LLMs for comprehensive biomolecular comprehension and multimodal generation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, ProtTeX, which tokenizes the protein sequences, structures, and textual information into a unified discrete space. This innovative approach enables joint training of the LLM exclusively through the Next-Token Prediction paradigm, facilitating multimodal protein reasoning and generation. ProtTeX enables general LLMs to perceive and process protein structures through sequential text input, leverage structural information as intermediate reasoning components, and generate or manipulate structures via sequential text output. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in protein function prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art domain expert model with a twofold increase in accuracy. Our framework enables high-quality conformational generation and customizable protein design. For the first time, we demonstrate that by adopting the standard training and inference pipelines from the LLM domain, ProtTeX empowers decoder-only LLMs to effectively address diverse spectrum of protein-related tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Chemistry-Inspired Diffusion with Non-Differentiable Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06502v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in the conditional generation of novel molecules. These models can be guided in two ways: (i) explicitly, through additional features representing the condition, or (ii) implicitly, using a property predictor. However, training property predictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled data and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a novel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled datasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a non-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of relying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form of estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a conditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this results in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular structures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly reduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used for stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit guidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular properties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular optimization tasks beyond stability optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Concept-Driven Deep Learning for Enhanced Protein-Specific Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08160v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, deep learning techniques have made significant strides in molecular generation for specific targets, driving advancements in drug discovery. However, existing molecular generation methods present significant limitations: those operating at the atomic level often lack synthetic feasibility, drug-likeness, and interpretability, while fragment-based approaches frequently overlook comprehensive factors that influence protein-molecule interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel fragment-based molecular generation framework tailored for specific proteins. Our method begins by constructing a protein subpocket and molecular arm concept-based neural network, which systematically integrates interaction force information and geometric complementarity to sample molecular arms for specific protein subpockets. Subsequently, we introduce a diffusion model to generate molecular backbones that connect these arms, ensuring structural integrity and chemical diversity. Our approach significantly improves synthetic feasibility and binding affinity, with a 4% increase in drug-likeness and a 6% improvement in synthetic feasibility. Furthermore, by integrating explicit interaction data through a concept-based model, our framework enhances interpretability, offering valuable insights into the molecular design process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Molecular Graphs and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03135v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional generalization capabilities, their ability to process graph data, such as molecular structures, remains limited. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Graph2Token, an efficient solution that aligns graph tokens to LLM tokens. The key idea is to represent a graph token with the LLM token vocabulary, without fine-tuning the LLM backbone. To achieve this goal, we first construct a molecule-text paired dataset from multisources, including CHEBI and HMDB, to train a graph structure encoder, which reduces the distance between graphs and texts representations in the feature space. Then, we propose a novel alignment strategy that associates a graph token with LLM tokens. To further unleash the potential of LLMs, we collect molecular IUPAC name identifiers, which are incorporated into the LLM prompts. By aligning molecular graphs as special tokens, we can activate LLM generalization ability to molecular few-shot learning. Extensive experiments on molecular classification and regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Graph2Token.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 camera ready version</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of manual annotation for biochemical properties, the performance for molecule generation tasks is still limited, especially for tasks involving multi-properties constraints. In this work, we present a two-step framework PEIT (Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning) to improve LLMs for molecular-related tasks. In the first step, we use textual descriptions, SMILES, and biochemical properties as multimodal inputs to pre-train a model called PEIT-GEN, by aligning multi-modal representations to synthesize instruction data. In the second step, we fine-tune existing open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the resulting PEIT-LLM can handle molecule captioning, text-based molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and our newly proposed multi-constraint molecule generation tasks. Experimental results show that our pre-trained PEIT-GEN outperforms MolT5 and BioT5 in molecule captioning, demonstrating modalities align well between textual descriptions, structures, and biochemical properties. Furthermore, PEIT-LLM shows promising improvements in multi-task molecule generation, proving the scalability of the PEIT framework for various molecular tasks. We release the code, constructed instruction data, and model checkpoints in https://github.com/chenlong164/PEIT.</p></details> | 9 |

While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an \emph{order-policy}, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the exact log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation. On the challenging domain of molecular graph generation, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k benchmarks, evaluated using the Fr\'{e}chet ChemNet Distance (FCD).</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a Python-based algorithm that automates the generation of reaction templates for the LAMMPS REACTION package, leveraging graph-theoretical principles and sub-graph isomorphism techniques. By representing molecular systems as mathematical graphs, the method enables automated identification of conserved molecular domains, reaction sites, and atom mappings, significantly reducing manual effort. The algorithm was validated on three case studies: poly-addition, poly-condensation, and chain polymerization, demonstrating its ability to map conserved regions, identify reaction-initiating atoms, and resolve challenges such as symmetric reactants and indistinguishable atoms. Additionally, the generated templates were optimized for computational efficiency by retaining only essential reactive domains, ensuring scalability and consistency in high-throughput workflows for computational chemistry, materials science, and machine learning applications. Future work will focus on extending the method to mixed organic-inorganic systems, incorporating adaptive scoring mechanisms, and integrating quantum mechanical calculations to enhance its applicability.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

In this study, we have developed P2DFlow, a generative model based on SE(3) flow matching, to predict the structural ensembles of proteins. We specifically designed a valuable prior for the flow process and enhanced the model's ability to distinguish each intermediate state by incorporating an additional dimension to describe the ensemble data, which can reflect the physical laws governing the distribution of ensembles, so that the prior knowledge can effectively guide the generation process. When trained and evaluated on the MD datasets of ATLAS, P2DFlow outperforms other baseline models on extensive experiments, successfully capturing the observable dynamic fluctuations as evidenced in crystal structure and MD simulations. As a potential proxy agent for protein molecular simulation, the high-quality ensembles generated by P2DFlow could significantly aid in understanding protein functions across various scenarios.

It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

This model features a hierarchical diffusion architecture that integrates both atom- and motif-level views of molecules, allowing for comprehensive exploration of complementary information. By leveraging classifier-free guidance and incorporating binding site features as conditional inputs, AMDiff ensures robust molecule generation across diverse targets. Compared to existing approaches, AMDiff exhibits superior validity and novelty in generating molecules tailored to fit various protein pockets. Case studies targeting protein kinases, including Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) and Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), demonstrate the model's capability in structure-based de novo drug design.

Existing methods fall into PC-Free and PC-Aware categories based on their use of 3D point clouds (PC). PC-Free models prioritize diversity but suffer from lower validity due to overlooking PC constraints, while PC-Aware models ensure higher validity but restrict diversity by enforcing strict PC constraints. To overcome these trade-offs without additional training, we propose HybridLinker, a framework that enhances PC-Aware inference by providing diverse bonding topologies from a pretrained PC-Free model as guidance. At its core, we propose LinkerDPS, the first diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) method operating across PC-Free and PC-Aware spaces, bridging molecular topology with 3D point clouds via an energy-inspired function. By transferring the diverse sampling distribution of PC-Free models into the PC-Aware distribution, HybridLinker significantly and consistently surpasses baselines, improving both validity and diversity in foundational molecular design and applied property optimization tasks, establishing a new DPS framework in the molecular and graph domains beyond imaging.</p></details> |  |

The use of graph autoencoders - with both encoder and decoder implemented as message passing networks - is intriguing due to their ability to generate permutation-invariant graph representations. However, this approach faces difficulties because decoding a graph structure from a single vector is challenging, and comparing input and output graphs requires an effective permutation-invariant similarity measure. As a result, many studies rely on approximate methods. In this work, we explore the effect of graph matching precision on the training behavior and generation capabilities of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we propose a transformer-based message passing graph decoder as an alternative to a graph neural network decoder, that is more robust and expressive by leveraging global attention mechanisms. (2) We show that the precision of graph matching has significant impact on training behavior and is essential for effective de novo (molecular) graph generation.

Our model produces state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with as few as 20 sampling steps, corresponding to a two order-of-magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight limitations of current evaluation methods for 3D generation and propose new benchmark metrics for unconditional molecular generators. Finally, using these new metrics, we compare our model's ability to generate high quality samples against current approaches and further demonstrate SemlaFlow's strong performance.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |

Language models and graph-based models are extensively utilized within this domain, consistently achieving state-of-the-art results across an array of tasks. However, the prevailing practice of representing chemical compounds in the SMILES format -- used by most datasets and many language models -- presents notable limitations as a training data format. In contrast, chemical fingerprints offer a more physically informed representation of compounds, thereby enhancing their suitability for model training. This study aims to develop a language model that is specifically trained on fingerprints. Furthermore, we introduce a bimodal architecture that integrates this language model with a graph model. Our proposed methodology synthesizes these approaches, utilizing RoBERTa as the language model and employing Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graphormer as graph models. This integration results in a significant improvement in predictive performance compared to conventional strategies for tasks such as Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) and the prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, among others.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, retrieval-augmented generation has become a principled approach commonly used with language models. However, the optimal integration of retrieval augmentation into molecular machine learning remains unclear. Graph neural networks stand to benefit from clever matching to understand the structural alignment of retrieved molecules to a query molecule. Neural graph matching offers a compelling solution by explicitly modeling node and edge affinities between two structural graphs while employing a noise-robust, end-to-end neural network to learn affinity metrics. We apply this approach to mass spectrum simulation and introduce MARASON, a novel model that incorporates neural graph matching to enhance a fragmentation-based neural network. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our design, with MARASON achieving 28% top-1 accuracy, a substantial improvement over the non-retrieval state-of-the-art accuracy of 19%. Moreover, MARASON outperforms both naive retrieval-augmented generation methods and traditional graph matching approaches.</p></details> |  |

The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.</p></details> |  |

Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in interpreting molecular structures, their instruction datasets are limited to the specific knowledge from task-oriented datasets and do not fully cover the fundamental characteristics of molecules, hindering their abilities as general-purpose molecular assistants. To address this issue, we propose Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules via multi-modal instruction tuning. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental features of molecules, incorporating essential knowledge from molecular structures. In addition, to improve understanding of molecular features, we introduce a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of different molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and generating relevant responses to users' queries with detailed explanations, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.

Traditional generative models often struggle with limited training data, particularly in drug discovery, where molecular datasets for specific therapeutic targets, such as nucleic acids binders and central nervous system (CNS) drugs, are scarce. ADSeqGAN addresses this challenge by integrating an auxiliary random forest classifier as an additional discriminator into the GAN framework, significantly improves molecular generation quality and class specificity. Our method incorporates pretrained generator and Wasserstein distance to enhance training stability and diversity. We evaluate ADSeqGAN on a dataset comprising nucleic acid-targeting and protein-targeting small molecules, demonstrating its superior ability to generate nucleic acid binders compared to baseline models such as SeqGAN, ORGAN, and MolGPT. Through an oversampling strategy, ADSeqGAN also significantly improves CNS drug generation, achieving a higher yield than traditional de novo models. Critical assessments, including docking simulations and molecular property analysis, confirm that ADSeqGAN-generated molecules exhibit strong binding affinities, enhanced chemical diversity, and improved synthetic feasibility. Overall, ADSeqGAN presents a novel framework for generative molecular design in data-scarce scenarios, offering potential applications in computational drug discovery. We have demonstrated the successful applications of ADSeqGAN in generating synthetic nucleic acid-targeting and CNS drugs in this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating $π$-Functional Molecules Using STGG+ with Active Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14842v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating novel molecules with out-of-distribution properties is a major challenge in molecular discovery. While supervised learning methods generate high-quality molecules similar to those in a dataset, they struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution properties. Reinforcement learning can explore new chemical spaces but often conducts 'reward-hacking' and generates non-synthesizable molecules. In this work, we address this problem by integrating a state-of-the-art supervised learning method, STGG+, in an active learning loop. Our approach iteratively generates, evaluates, and fine-tunes STGG+ to continuously expand its knowledge. We denote this approach STGG+AL. We apply STGG+AL to the design of organic $\pi$-functional materials, specifically two challenging tasks: 1) generating highly absorptive molecules characterized by high oscillator strength and 2) designing absorptive molecules with reasonable oscillator strength in the near-infrared (NIR) range. The generated molecules are validated and rationalized in-silico with time-dependent density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that our method is highly effective in generating novel molecules with high oscillator strength, contrary to existing methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We open-source our active-learning code along with our Conjugated-xTB dataset containing 2.9 million $\pi$-conjugated molecules and the function for approximating the oscillator strength and absorption wavelength (based on sTDA-xTB).</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/STGG-AL</p></details> |

This approach reduces computational complexity while maintaining high chemical validity, enabling more efficient and scalable molecular generation. We benchmark FragFM against state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based models on standard molecular generation benchmarks and natural product datasets, demonstrating superior performance in validity, property control, and sampling efficiency. Notably, FragFM achieves over 99\% validity with significantly fewer sampling steps, improving scalability while preserving molecular diversity. These results highlight the potential of fragment-based generative modeling for large-scale, property-aware molecular design, paving the way for more efficient exploration of chemical space.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 figures, under review</p></details> |

Existing methods primarily focus on single-scale features, overlooking the hierarchical molecular structures that determine different molecular properties. To address these issues, we introduce Universal Matching Networks (UniMatch), a dual matching framework that integrates explicit hierarchical molecular matching with implicit task-level matching via meta-learning, bridging multi-level molecular representations and task-level generalization. Specifically, our approach explicitly captures structural features across multiple levels, such as atoms, substructures, and molecules, via hierarchical pooling and matching, facilitating precise molecular representation and comparison. Additionally, we employ a meta-learning strategy for implicit task-level matching, allowing the model to capture shared patterns across tasks and quickly adapt to new ones. This unified matching framework ensures effective molecular alignment while leveraging shared meta-knowledge for fast adaptation. Our experimental results demonstrate that UniMatch outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the MoleculeNet and FS-Mol benchmarks, achieving improvements of 2.87% in AUROC and 6.52% in delta AUPRC. UniMatch also shows excellent generalization ability on the Meta-MolNet benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as ICLR 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Diverse Molecules? Towards Alignment with Structural Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03138v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in molecular generation, which offers potential to accelerate drug discovery. However, the current LLMs overlook a critical requirement for drug discovery: proposing a diverse set of molecules. This diversity is essential for improving the chances of finding a viable drug, as it provides alternative molecules that may succeed where others fail in real-world validations. Nevertheless, the LLMs often output structurally similar molecules. While decoding schemes like diverse beam search may enhance textual diversity, this often does not align with molecular structural diversity. In response, we propose a new method for fine-tuning molecular generative LLMs to autoregressively generate a set of structurally diverse molecules, where each molecule is generated by conditioning on the previously generated molecules. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) supervised fine-tuning to adapt LLMs to autoregressively generate molecules in a sequence and (2) reinforcement learning to maximize structural diversity within the generated molecules. Our experiments show that the proposed approach enables LLMs to generate diverse molecules better than existing approaches for diverse sequence generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MING: A Functional Approach to Learning Molecular Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12522v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional molecule generation methods often rely on sequence- or graph-based representations, which can limit their expressive power or require complex permutation-equivariant architectures. This paper introduces a novel paradigm for learning molecule generative models based on functional representations. Specifically, we propose Molecular Implicit Neural Generation (MING), a diffusion-based model that learns molecular distributions in the function space. Unlike standard diffusion processes in the data space, MING employs a novel functional denoising probabilistic process, which jointly denoises information in both the function's input and output spaces by leveraging an expectation-maximization procedure for latent implicit neural representations of data. This approach enables a simple yet effective model design that accurately captures underlying function distributions. Experimental results on molecule-related datasets demonstrate MING's superior performance and ability to generate plausible molecular samples, surpassing state-of-the-art data-space methods while offering a more streamlined architecture and significantly faster generation times.

| **[Conformal Generative Modeling with Improved Sample Efficiency through Sequential Greedy Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01660v2)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models lack rigorous statistical guarantees for their outputs and are therefore unreliable in safety-critical applications. In this work, we propose Sequential Conformal Prediction for Generative Models (SCOPE-Gen), a sequential conformal prediction method producing prediction sets that satisfy a rigorous statistical guarantee called conformal admissibility control. This guarantee states that with high probability, the prediction sets contain at least one admissible (or valid) example. To this end, our method first samples an initial set of i.i.d. examples from a black box generative model. Then, this set is iteratively pruned via so-called greedy filters. As a consequence of the iterative generation procedure, admissibility of the final prediction set factorizes as a Markov chain. This factorization is crucial, because it allows to control each factor separately, using conformal prediction. In comparison to prior work, our method demonstrates a large reduction in the number of admissibility evaluations during calibration. This reduction is important in safety-critical applications, where these evaluations must be conducted manually by domain experts and are therefore costly and time consuming. We highlight the advantages of our method in terms of admissibility evaluations and cardinality of the prediction sets through experiments in natural language generation and molecular graph extension tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MassSpecGym: A benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23326v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery and identification of molecules in biological and environmental samples is crucial for advancing biomedical and chemical sciences. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the leading technique for high-throughput elucidation of molecular structures. However, decoding a molecular structure from its mass spectrum is exceptionally challenging, even when performed by human experts. As a result, the vast majority of acquired MS/MS spectra remain uninterpreted, thereby limiting our understanding of the underlying (bio)chemical processes. Despite decades of progress in machine learning applications for predicting molecular structures from MS/MS spectra, the development of new methods is severely hindered by the lack of standard datasets and evaluation protocols. To address this problem, we propose MassSpecGym -- the first comprehensive benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules from MS/MS data. Our benchmark comprises the largest publicly available collection of high-quality labeled MS/MS spectra and defines three MS/MS annotation challenges: de novo molecular structure generation, molecule retrieval, and spectrum simulation. It includes new evaluation metrics and a generalization-demanding data split, therefore standardizing the MS/MS annotation tasks and rendering the problem accessible to the broad machine learning community.

| **[Symmetry-Preserving Diffusion Models via Target Symmetrization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09890v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are powerful tools for capturing complex distributions, but modeling data with inherent symmetries, such as molecular structures, remains challenging. Equivariant denoisers are commonly used to address this, but they introduce architectural complexity and optimization challenges, including noisy gradients and convergence issues. We propose a novel approach that enforces equivariance through a symmetrized loss function, which applies a time-dependent weighted averaging operation over group actions to the model's prediction target. This ensures equivariance without explicit architectural constraints and reduces gradient variance, leading to more stable and efficient optimization. Our method uses Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the average, incurring minimal computational overhead. We provide theoretical guarantees of equivariance for the minimizer of our loss function and demonstrate its effectiveness on synthetic datasets and the molecular conformation generation task using the GEOM-QM9 dataset. Experiments show improved sample quality compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of our approach to enhance the scalability and practicality of equivariant diffusion models in generative tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffMS: Diffusion Generation of Molecules Conditioned on Mass Spectra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09571v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mass spectrometry plays a fundamental role in elucidating the structures of unknown molecules and subsequent scientific discoveries. One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional $\textit{de novo}$ generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on $\textit{de novo}$ molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size. DiffMS code is publicly available at https://github.com/coleygroup/DiffMS.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Diffusion Models for Molecules: A Survey of Methods and Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09511v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative tasks about molecules, including but not limited to molecule generation, are crucial for drug discovery and material design, and have consistently attracted significant attention. In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as an impressive class of deep generative models, sparking extensive research and leading to numerous studies on their application to molecular generative tasks. Despite the proliferation of related work, there remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this area. Particularly, due to the diversity of diffusion model formulations, molecular data modalities, and generative task types, the research landscape is challenging to navigate, hindering understanding and limiting the area's growth. To address this, this paper conducts a comprehensive survey of diffusion model-based molecular generative methods. We systematically review the research from the perspectives of methodological formulations, data modalities, and task types, offering a novel taxonomy. This survey aims to facilitate understanding and further flourishing development in this area.

| **[Enhancing Diffusion Models Efficiency by Disentangling Total-Variance and Signal-to-Noise Ratio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08598v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long sampling time of diffusion models remains a significant bottleneck, which can be mitigated by reducing the number of diffusion time steps. However, the quality of samples with fewer steps is highly dependent on the noise schedule, i.e., the specific manner in which noise is introduced and the signal is reduced at each step. Although prior work has improved upon the original variance-preserving and variance-exploding schedules, these approaches $\textit{passively}$ adjust the total variance, without direct control over it. In this work, we propose a novel total-variance/signal-to-noise-ratio disentangled (TV/SNR) framework, where TV and SNR can be controlled independently. Our approach reveals that different existing schedules, where the TV explodes exponentially, can be $\textit{improved}$ by setting a constant TV schedule while preserving the same SNR schedule. Furthermore, generalizing the SNR schedule of the optimal transport flow matching significantly improves the performance in molecular structure generation, achieving few step generation of stable molecules. A similar tendency is observed in image generation, where our approach with a uniform diffusion time grid performs comparably to the highly tailored EDM sampler.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Representation Condition Improves Equivariant Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03655v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in molecular generative models have demonstrated substantial potential in accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often face challenges in generating high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to enhance the performance of molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the molecule generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared to directly generating a molecule, the relatively easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second-stage generation to reach a high-quality molecule in a more goal-oriented and much faster way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as the base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation tasks on the widely-used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 31\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations over conditioning on individual property values as in previous approaches. Furthermore, we show that, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly accelerating the generation process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation of Molecules via Algebraic Data Types : Advancing Beyond SMILES & SELFIES](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13633v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel molecular representation through Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) - composite data structures formed through the combination of simpler types that obey algebraic laws. By explicitly considering how the datatype of a representation constrains the operations which may be performed, we ensure meaningful inference can be performed over generative models (programs with sample} and score operations). This stands in contrast to string-based representations where string-type operations may only indirectly correspond to chemical and physical molecular properties, and at worst produce nonsensical output. The ADT presented implements the Dietz representation for molecular constitution via multigraphs and bonding systems, and uses atomic coordinate data to represent 3D information and stereochemical features. This creates a general digital molecular representation which surpasses the limitations of the string-based representations and the 2D-graph based models on which they are based. In addition, we present novel support for quantum information through representation of shells, subshells, and orbitals, greatly expanding the representational scope beyond current approaches, for instance in Molecular Orbital theory. The framework's capabilities are demonstrated through key applications: Bayesian probabilistic programming is demonstrated through integration with LazyPPL, a lazy probabilistic programming library; molecules are made instances of a group under rotation, necessary for geometric learning techniques which exploit the invariance of molecular properties under different representations; and the framework's flexibility is demonstrated through an extension to model chemical reactions. After critiquing previous representations, we provide an open-source solution in Haskell - a type-safe, purely functional programming language.</p></details> | 1 Figure |
| **[Representational Alignment with Chemical Induced Fit for Molecular Relational Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07027v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) is widely applied in natural sciences to predict relationships between molecular pairs by extracting structural features. The representational similarity between substructure pairs determines the functional compatibility of molecular binding sites. Nevertheless, aligning substructure representations by attention mechanisms lacks guidance from chemical knowledge, resulting in unstable model performance in chemical space (\textit{e.g.}, functional group, scaffold) shifted data. With theoretical justification, we propose the \textbf{Re}presentational \textbf{Align}ment with Chemical Induced \textbf{Fit} (ReAlignFit) to enhance the stability of MRL. ReAlignFit dynamically aligns substructure representation in MRL by introducing chemical Induced Fit-based inductive bias. In the induction process, we design the Bias Correction Function based on substructure edge reconstruction to align representations between substructure pairs by simulating chemical conformational changes (dynamic combination of substructures). ReAlignFit further integrates the Subgraph Information Bottleneck during fit process to refine and optimize substructure pairs exhibiting high chemical functional compatibility, leveraging them to generate molecular embeddings. Experimental results on nine datasets demonstrate that ReAlignFit outperforms state-of-the-art models in two tasks and significantly enhances model's stability in both rule-shifted and scaffold-shifted data distributions.</p></details> |  |

Although diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, these models typically adapt from the frameworks designed for image generation, making them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose a novel Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff) model that follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum and is guided by higher-order information, enabling the progressive generation of plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiminghh/HOG-Diff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mol-LLM: Generalist Molecular LLM with Improved Graph Utilization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02810v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have motivated the development of general LLMs for molecular tasks. While several studies have demonstrated that fine-tuned LLMs can achieve impressive benchmark performances, they are far from genuine generalist molecular LLMs due to a lack of fundamental understanding of molecular structure. Specifically, when given molecular task instructions, LLMs trained with naive next-token prediction training assign similar likelihood scores to both original and negatively corrupted molecules, revealing their lack of molecular structure understanding that is crucial for reliable and general molecular LLMs. To overcome this limitation and obtain a true generalist molecular LLM, we introduce a novel multi-modal training method based on a thorough multi-modal instruction tuning as well as a molecular structure preference optimization between chosen and rejected graphs. On various molecular benchmarks, the proposed generalist molecular LLM, called Mol-LLM, achieves state-of-the-art performances among generalist LLMs on most tasks, at the same time, surpassing or comparable to state-of-the-art specialist LLMs. Moreover, Mol-LLM also shows superior generalization performances in reaction prediction tasks, demonstrating the effect of the molecular structure understanding for generalization perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling on Lie Groups via Euclidean Generalized Score Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02513v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We extend Euclidean score-based diffusion processes to generative modeling on Lie groups. Through the formalism of Generalized Score Matching, our approach yields a Langevin dynamics which decomposes as a direct sum of Lie algebra representations, enabling generative processes on Lie groups while operating in Euclidean space. Unlike equivariant models, which restrict the space of learnable functions by quotienting out group orbits, our method can model any target distribution on any (non-Abelian) Lie group. Standard score matching emerges as a special case of our framework when the Lie group is the translation group. We prove that our generalized generative processes arise as solutions to a new class of paired stochastic differential equations (SDEs), introduced here for the first time. We validate our approach through experiments on diverse data types, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications such as SO(3)-guided molecular conformer generation and modeling ligand-specific global SE(3) transformations for molecular docking, showing improvement in comparison to Riemannian diffusion on the group itself. We show that an appropriate choice of Lie group enhances learning efficiency by reducing the effective dimensionality of the trajectory space and enables the modeling of transitions between complex data distributions. Additionally, we demonstrate the universality of our approach by deriving how it extends to flow matching.</p></details> | 27 pages |

At the core of our approach is a reversible "flattening" process that transforms graphs into random sequences. By sampling and learning from these sequences, AutoGraph enables transformers to model and generate complex graph structures in a manner akin to natural language. In contrast to diffusion models that rely on computationally intensive node features, our approach operates exclusively on these sequences. The sampling complexity and sequence length scale linearly with the number of edges, making AutoGraph highly scalable for generating large sparse graphs. Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse synthetic and molecular graph generation benchmarks, while delivering a 100-fold generation and a 3-fold training speedup compared to leading diffusion models. Additionally, it demonstrates promising transfer capabilities and supports substructure-conditioned generation without additional fine-tuning. By extending language modeling techniques to graph generation, this work paves the way for developing graph foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Docking-Aware Attention: Dynamic Protein Representations through Molecular Context Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01461v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational prediction of enzymatic reactions represents a crucial challenge in sustainable chemical synthesis across various scientific domains, ranging from drug discovery to materials science and green chemistry. These syntheses rely on proteins that selectively catalyze complex molecular transformations. These protein catalysts exhibit remarkable substrate adaptability, with the same protein often catalyzing different chemical transformations depending on its molecular partners. Current approaches to protein representation in reaction prediction either ignore protein structure entirely or rely on static embeddings, failing to capture how proteins dynamically adapt their behavior to different substrates. We present Docking-Aware Attention (DAA), a novel architecture that generates dynamic, context-dependent protein representations by incorporating molecular docking information into the attention mechanism. DAA combines physical interaction scores from docking predictions with learned attention patterns to focus on protein regions most relevant to specific molecular interactions. We evaluate our method on enzymatic reaction prediction, where it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 62.2\% accuracy versus 56.79\% on complex molecules and 55.54\% versus 49.45\% on innovative reactions. Through detailed ablation studies and visualizations, we demonstrate how DAA generates interpretable attention patterns that adapt to different molecular contexts. Our approach represents a general framework for context-aware protein representation in biocatalysis prediction, with potential applications across enzymatic synthesis planning. We open-source our implementation and pre-trained models to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable Boltzmann Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14426v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of equilibrium samples of molecular systems has been a long-standing problem in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators are a generative machine learning method that addresses this issue by learning a transformation via a normalizing flow from a simple prior distribution to the target Boltzmann distribution of interest. Recently, flow matching has been employed to train Boltzmann Generators for small molecular systems in Cartesian coordinates. We extend this work and propose a first framework for Boltzmann Generators that are transferable across chemical space, such that they predict zero-shot Boltzmann distributions for test molecules without being retrained for these systems. These transferable Boltzmann Generators allow approximate sampling from the target distribution of unseen systems, as well as efficient reweighting to the target Boltzmann distribution. The transferability of the proposed framework is evaluated on dipeptides, where we show that it generalizes efficiently to unseen systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed architecture enhances the efficiency of Boltzmann Generators trained on single molecular systems.</p></details> |  |

Here we introduce the QMe14S dataset, comprising 186,102 small organic molecules featuring 14 elements (H, B, C, N, O, F, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, As, Se, Br) and 47 functional groups. Using density functional theory at the B3LYP/TZVP level, we optimized the geometries and calculated properties including energy, atomic charge, atomic force, dipole moment, quadrupole moment, polarizability, octupole moment, first hyperpolarizability, and Hessian. At the same level, we obtained the harmonic IR, Raman and NMR spectra. Furthermore, we conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to generate dynamic configurations and extract nonequilibrium properties, including energy, forces, and Hessians. By leveraging our E(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network (DetaNet), we demonstrated that models trained on QMe14S outperform those trained on the previously developed QM9S dataset in simulating molecular spectra. The QMe14S dataset thus serves as a comprehensive benchmark for molecular simulations, offering valuable insights into structure-property relationships.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4figures |

Despite their strong predictive capabilities, these models lack a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty, which is key in scientific applications such as PDE solving, molecular generation and Machine Learning Force Fields. To address this shortcoming we present BARNN: a variational Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network. BARNNs aim to provide a principled way to turn any autoregressive or recurrent model into its Bayesian version. BARNN is based on the variational dropout method, allowing to apply it to large recurrent neural networks as well. We also introduce a temporal version of the "Variational Mixtures of Posteriors" prior (tVAMP-prior) to make Bayesian inference efficient and well-calibrated. Extensive experiments on PDE modelling and molecular generation demonstrate that BARNN not only achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, but also excels in uncertainty quantification and modelling long-range dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Chemical Design and Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21422v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced computational chemistry research in various tasks. However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for chemicals. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Discrete Denoising Diffusion Model for Molecular Generation with OpenFL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12523v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating unique molecules with biochemically desired properties to serve as viable drug candidates is a difficult task that requires specialized domain expertise. In recent years, diffusion models have shown promising results in accelerating the drug design process through AI-driven molecular generation. However, training these models requires massive amounts of data, which are often isolated in proprietary silos. OpenFL is a federated learning framework that enables privacy-preserving collaborative training across these decentralized data sites. In this work, we present a federated discrete denoising diffusion model that was trained using OpenFL. The federated model achieves comparable performance with a model trained on centralized data when evaluating the uniqueness and validity of the generated molecules. This demonstrates the utility of federated learning in the drug design process. OpenFL is available at: https://github.com/securefederatedai/openfl</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Learning to generate feasible graphs using graph grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06003v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative methods for graphs need to be sufficiently flexible to model complex dependencies between sets of nodes. At the same time, the generated graphs need to satisfy domain-dependent feasibility conditions, that is, they should not violate certain constraints that would make their interpretation impossible within the given application domain (e.g. a molecular graph where an atom has a very large number of chemical bounds). Crucially, constraints can involve not only local but also long-range dependencies: for example, the maximal length of a cycle can be bounded. Currently, a large class of generative approaches for graphs, such as methods based on artificial neural networks, is based on message passing schemes. These approaches suffer from information 'dilution' issues that severely limit the maximal range of the dependencies that can be modeled. To address this problem, we propose a generative approach based on the notion of graph grammars. The key novel idea is to introduce a domain-dependent coarsening procedure to provide short-cuts for long-range dependencies. We show the effectiveness of our proposal in two domains: 1) small drugs and 2) RNA secondary structures. In the first case, we compare the quality of the generated molecular graphs via the Molecular Sets (MOSES) benchmark suite, which evaluates the distance between generated and real molecules, their lipophilicity, synthesizability, and drug-likeness. In the second case, we show that the approach can generate very large graphs (with hundreds of nodes) that are accepted as valid examples for a desired RNA family by the "Infernal" covariance model, a state-of-the-art RNA classifier. Our implementation is available on github: github.com/fabriziocosta/GraphLearn</p></details> |  |

MOFA addresses key challenges in integrating GPU-accelerated computing for GPU-intensive GenAI tasks, including distributed training and inference, alongside CPU- and GPU-optimized tasks for screening and filtering AI-generated MOFs using molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and Monte Carlo simulations. These heterogeneous tasks are unified within an online learning framework that optimizes the utilization of available CPU and GPU resources across HPC systems. Performance metrics from a 450-node (14,400 AMD Zen 3 CPUs + 1800 NVIDIA A100 GPUs) supercomputer run demonstrate that MOFA achieves high-throughput generation of novel MOF structures, with CO$_2$ adsorption capacities ranking among the top 10 in the hypothetical MOF (hMOF) dataset. Furthermore, the production of high-quality MOFs exhibits a linear relationship with the number of nodes utilized. The modular architecture of MOFA will facilitate its integration into other scientific applications that dynamically combine GenAI with large-scale simulations.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Molecular Graph Contrastive Learning with Line Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08589v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trapped by the label scarcity in molecular property prediction and drug design, graph contrastive learning (GCL) came forward. Leading contrastive learning works show two kinds of view generators, that is, random or learnable data corruption and domain knowledge incorporation. While effective, the two ways also lead to molecular semantics altering and limited generalization capability, respectively. To this end, we relate the \textbf{L}in\textbf{E} graph with \textbf{MO}lecular graph co\textbf{N}trastive learning and propose a novel method termed \textit{LEMON}. Specifically, by contrasting the given graph with the corresponding line graph, the graph encoder can freely encode the molecular semantics without omission. Furthermore, we present a new patch with edge attribute fusion and two local contrastive losses enhance information transmission and tackle hard negative samples. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for view generation, superior performance on molecular property prediction suggests the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Using this representation, we propose a new model based on walk-jump sampling for unconditional 3D molecule generation in the continuous space using neural fields. Our model, FuncMol, encodes molecular fields into latent codes using a conditional neural field, samples noisy codes from a Gaussian-smoothed distribution with Langevin MCMC (walk), denoises these samples in a single step (jump), and finally decodes them into molecular fields. FuncMol performs all-atom generation of 3D molecules without assumptions on the molecular structure and scales well with the size of molecules, unlike most approaches. Our method achieves competitive results on drug-like molecules and easily scales to macro-cyclic peptides, with at least one order of magnitude faster sampling.

| **[GDiffRetro: Retrosynthesis Prediction with Dual Graph Enhanced Molecular Representation and Diffusion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08001v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrosynthesis prediction focuses on identifying reactants capable of synthesizing a target product. Typically, the retrosynthesis prediction involves two phases: Reaction Center Identification and Reactant Generation. However, we argue that most existing methods suffer from two limitations in the two phases: (i) Existing models do not adequately capture the ``face'' information in molecular graphs for the reaction center identification. (ii) Current approaches for the reactant generation predominantly use sequence generation in a 2D space, which lacks versatility in generating reasonable distributions for completed reactive groups and overlooks molecules' inherent 3D properties. To overcome the above limitations, we propose GDiffRetro. For the reaction center identification, GDiffRetro uniquely integrates the original graph with its corresponding dual graph to represent molecular structures, which helps guide the model to focus more on the faces in the graph. For the reactant generation, GDiffRetro employs a conditional diffusion model in 3D to further transform the obtained synthon into a complete reactant. Our experimental findings reveal that GDiffRetro outperforms state-of-the-art semi-template models across various evaluative metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[D3MES: Diffusion Transformer with multihead equivariant self-attention for 3D molecule generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07077v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting the diverse conformational states of molecules is crucial for advancing fields such as chemistry, material science, and drug development. Despite significant progress in generative models, accurately generating complex and biologically or material-relevant molecular structures remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model for three-dimensional (3D) molecule generation that combines a classifiable diffusion model, Diffusion Transformer, with multihead equivariant self-attention. This method addresses two key challenges: correctly attaching hydrogen atoms in generated molecules through learning representations of molecules after hydrogen atoms are removed; and overcoming the limitations of existing models that cannot generate molecules across multiple classes simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that our model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across several key metrics but also exhibits robustness and versatility, making it highly suitable for early-stage large-scale generation processes in molecular design, followed by validation and further screening to obtain molecules with specific properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenMol: A Drug Discovery Generalist with Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06158v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is a complex process that involves multiple scenarios and stages, such as fragment-constrained molecule generation, hit generation and lead optimization. However, existing molecular generative models can only tackle one or two of these scenarios and lack the flexibility to address various aspects of the drug discovery pipeline. In this paper, we present Generalist Molecular generative model (GenMol), a versatile framework that addresses these limitations by applying discrete diffusion to the Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) molecular representation. GenMol generates SAFE sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering and enhanced computational efficiency. Moreover, under the discrete diffusion framework, we introduce fragment remasking, a strategy that optimizes molecules by replacing fragments with masked tokens and regenerating them, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model trained on SAFE representations in de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization. These experimental results demonstrate that GenMol can tackle a wide range of drug discovery tasks, providing a unified and versatile approach for molecular design.</p></details> |  |

Recently developed deep learning methods, particularly diffusion models have reached competitive performance over traditional cheminformatical approaches. However, these methods are often time-consuming or require extra support from traditional methods. We propose EquiBoost, a boosting model that stacks several equivariant graph transformers as weak learners, to iteratively refine 3D conformations of molecules. Without relying on diffusion techniques, EquiBoost balances accuracy and efficiency more effectively than diffusion-based methods. Notably, compared to the previous state-of-the-art diffusion method, EquiBoost improves generation quality and preserves diversity, achieving considerably better precision of Average Minimum RMSD (AMR) on the GEOM datasets. This work rejuvenates boosting and sheds light on its potential to be a robust alternative to diffusion models in certain scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MADGEN: Mass-Spec attends to De Novo Molecular generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01950v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The annotation (assigning structural chemical identities) of MS/MS spectra remains a significant challenge due to the enormous molecular diversity in biological samples and the limited scope of reference databases. Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the "dark chemical space" without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Exploring Molecule Generation Using Latent Space Graph Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03696v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating molecular graphs is a challenging task due to their discrete nature and the competitive objectives involved. Diffusion models have emerged as SOTA approaches in data generation across various modalities. For molecular graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) as a diffusion backbone have achieved impressive results. Latent space diffusion, where diffusion occurs in a low-dimensional space via an autoencoder, has demonstrated computational efficiency. However, the literature on latent space diffusion for molecular graphs is scarce, and no commonly accepted best practices exist. In this work, we explore different approaches and hyperparameters, contrasting generative flow models (denoising diffusion, flow matching, heat dissipation) and architectures (GNNs and E(3)-equivariant GNNs). Our experiments reveal a high sensitivity to the choice of approach and design decisions.

| **[Navigating Chemical-Linguistic Sharing Space with Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20888v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical language models (CLMs) are prominent for their effectiveness in exploring chemical space and enabling molecular engineering. However, while exploring chemical-linguistic space, CLMs suffer from the gap between natural language and molecular representations. This challenge is primarily due to the inherent modeling differences between molecules and texts: molecules operate unified modeling to learn chemical space, while natural language sequentially models the semantic space. Additionally, the limited availability of high-quality text-to-molecule datasets further exacerbates this challenge. To address the problem, we first verified the information bias in molecular representations from different perspectives. We then developed the Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding (HME) framework, a unified molecular encoder compressing the molecular features from fragment sequence, topology, and conformation with Q-learning. To better model chemical-linguistic space, we further constructed the MCMoD dataset, which contains over one million molecules with various conditions, including properties, fragments, and descriptions. Experimentally, HME promotes CLMs to achieve chemical-linguistic sharing space exploration: (1) chemical space exploration with linguistic guidance, where HME achieves significant improvements (+8.9\% FCD) for molecular design in multiple constraints, even in zero-shot scenarios; (2) linguistic space exploration with molecular guidance, where HME generates textual descriptions with high qualities (+11.6\% BLEU) for molecules. These results highlight the precision of HME in handling multi-objective and cross-domain tasks, as well as its remarkable generalization capability on unseen task combinations. HME offers a new perspective on navigating chemical-linguistic sharing space, advancing the potential of CLMs in both fundamental research and practical applications in chemistry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

We show how applications such as structure-based, fragment-based, and ligand-based drug design are formulated in the UniGuide framework and demonstrate on-par or superior performance compared to specialised models. Offering a more versatile approach, UniGuide has the potential to streamline the development of molecular generative models, allowing them to be readily used in diverse application scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)</p></details> |

We find that a key limitation is not in the molecule generation process itself, but in the poor generalization capabilities of molecular property predictors. We tackle this challenge by creating an active-learning, closed-loop molecule generation pipeline, whereby molecular generative models are iteratively refined on feedback from quantum chemical simulations to improve generalization to new chemical space. Compared against other generative model approaches, only our active learning approach generates molecules with properties that extrapolate beyond the training data (reaching up to 0.44 standard deviations beyond the training data range) and out-of-distribution molecule classification accuracy is improved by 79%. By conditioning molecular generation on thermodynamic stability data from the active-learning loop, the proportion of stable molecules generated is 3.5x higher than the next-best model.</p></details> |  |

Most methods in previous studies learn the semantics and syntax of molecular structures by analyzing molecular graphs or simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings; however, they do not take into account the drug responses of the biological systems consisting of genes and proteins. In this study we propose a deep generative model, Gx2Mol, which utilizes gene expression profiles to generate molecular structures with desirable phenotypes for arbitrary target proteins. In the algorithm, a variational autoencoder is employed as a feature extractor to learn the latent feature distribution of the gene expression profiles. Then, a long short-term memory is leveraged as the chemical generator to produce syntactically valid SMILES strings that satisfy the feature conditions of the gene expression profile extracted by the feature extractor. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that the proposed Gx2Mol model can produce new molecules with potential bioactivities and drug-like properties.</p></details> |  |

Dissipativity is a crucial indicator for dynamical systems that generalizes stability and input-output stability, known to be valid across various systems including robotics, biological systems, and molecular dynamics. By analytically proving the general solution to the nonlinear Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for dissipativity, we propose a differentiable projection that transforms any dynamics represented by neural networks into dissipative ones and a learning method for the transformed dynamics. Utilizing the generality of dissipativity, our method strictly guarantee stability, input-output stability, and energy conservation of trained dynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method against out-of-domain input through applications to robotic arms and fluid dynamics.

However, in molecular science, CMs are less common than black-box models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), due to their need for predefined concepts and manual labeling. This paper introduces the Automated Molecular Concept (AutoMolCo) framework, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate and label predictive molecular concepts. Through iterative concept refinement, AutoMolCo enables simple linear models to outperform GNNs and LLM in-context learning on several benchmarks. The framework operates without human knowledge input, overcoming limitations of existing CMs while maintaining explainability and allowing easy intervention. Experiments on MoleculeNet and High-Throughput Experimentation (HTE) datasets demonstrate that AutoMolCo-induced explainable CMs are beneficial for molecular science research.</p></details> |  |

More recently, these workflows have been significantly augmented with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and systems of autonomous agents capable of utilizing pre-trained models to make predictions in the context of more complex research tasks. While effective, there is still room for substantial improvement within agentic systems on the retrieval of salient information for material design tasks. Within this context, alternative uses of predictive deep learning models, such as leveraging their latent representations to facilitate cross-modal retrieval augmented generation within agentic systems for task-specific materials design, has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained chemistry foundation models can serve as a basis for enabling structure-focused, semantic chemistry information retrieval for both small-molecules, complex polymeric materials, and reactions. Additionally, we show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with multi-modal models such as OpenCLIP facilitate unprecedented queries and information retrieval across multiple characterization data domains. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of these models within multi-agent systems to facilitate structure and topological-based natural language queries and information retrieval for different research tasks.</p></details> |  |

Here we hypothesized that ORs can be viewed as 3D spatial filters that extract molecular features relevant to the olfactory system, similarly to the spatio-temporal filters found in other sensory modalities. To build these filters, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict human olfactory percepts obtained from several semantic datasets. Our neural network, the DeepNose, produced responses that are approximately invariant to the molecules' orientation, due to its equivariant architecture. Our network offers high-fidelity perceptual predictions for different olfactory datasets. In addition, our approach allows us to identify molecular features that contribute to specific perceptual descriptors. Because the DeepNose network is designed to be aligned with the biological system, our approach predicts distinct perceptual qualities for different stereoisomers. The architecture of the DeepNose relying on the processing of several molecules at the same time permits inferring the perceptual quality of odor mixtures. We propose that the DeepNose network can use 3D molecular shapes to generate high-quality predictions for human olfactory percepts and help identify molecular features responsible for odor quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, to be appear in the proceedings of Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (ACSSC 2024)</p></details> |

While early work has shown that ML-based retrosynthesis models can predict reasonable routes, their low accuracy for less frequent, yet important reactions has been pointed out. As multi-step search algorithms are limited to reactions suggested by the underlying model, the applicability of those tools is inherently constrained by the accuracy of retrosynthesis prediction. Inspired by how chemists use different strategies to ideate reactions, we propose Chimera: a framework for building highly accurate reaction models that combine predictions from diverse sources with complementary inductive biases using a learning-based ensembling strategy. We instantiate the framework with two newly developed models, which already by themselves achieve state of the art in their categories. Through experiments across several orders of magnitude in data scale and time-splits, we show Chimera outperforms all major models by a large margin, owing both to the good individual performance of its constituents, but also to the scalability of our ensembling strategy. Moreover, we find that PhD-level organic chemists prefer predictions from Chimera over baselines in terms of quality. Finally, we transfer the largest-scale checkpoint to an internal dataset from a major pharmaceutical company, showing robust generalization under distribution shift. With the new dimension that our framework unlocks, we anticipate further acceleration in the development of even more accurate models.</p></details> |  |

The model captures the information of the forces and local constraints between atoms so that the generated molecules can maintain Euclidean transformation and high level of effectiveness and diversity. We also use the lowerrank manifold advantage of the latent variables of the latent model to fuse the information of the forces between atoms to better maintain the geometric equivariant properties of the molecules. Because there is no need to perform information fusion encoding in stages like traditional encoders and decoders, this reduces the amount of calculation in the back-propagation process. The model keeps the forces and local constraints of particle bonds in the latent variable space, reducing the impact of underfitting on the surface of the network on the large position drift of the particle geometry, so that our model can converge earlier. We introduce a distribution control variable in each backward step to strengthen exploration and improve the diversity of generation. In the experiment, the quality of the samples we generated and the convergence speed of the model have been significantly improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.05710 by other authors</p></details> |

However, extending these models to generate 3D molecular structures presents significant challenges. Two primary obstacles emerge: (1) the difficulty in designing a 3D line notation that ensures SE(3)-invariant atomic coordinates, and (2) the non-trivial task of tokenizing continuous coordinates for use in LMs, which inherently require discrete inputs. To address these challenges, we propose Mol-StrucTok, a novel method for tokenizing 3D molecular structures. Our approach comprises two key innovations: (1) We design a line notation for 3D molecules by extracting local atomic coordinates in a spherical coordinate system. This notation builds upon existing 2D line notations and remains agnostic to their specific forms, ensuring compatibility with various molecular representation schemes. (2) We employ a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to tokenize these coordinates, treating them as generation descriptors. To further enhance the representation, we incorporate neighborhood bond lengths and bond angles as understanding descriptors. Leveraging this tokenization framework, we train a GPT-2 style model for 3D molecular generation tasks. Results demonstrate strong performance with significantly faster generation speeds and competitive chemical stability compared to previous methods. Further, by integrating our learned discrete representations into Graphormer model for property prediction on QM9 dataset, Mol-StrucTok reveals consistent improvements across various molecular properties, underscoring the versatility and robustness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, preprint</p></details> |

| **[Riemannian Denoising Score Matching for Molecular Structure Optimization with Accurate Energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19769v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a modified score matching method aimed at generating molecular structures with high energy accuracy. The denoising process of score matching or diffusion models mirrors molecular structure optimization, where scores act like physical force fields that guide particles toward equilibrium states. To achieve energetically accurate structures, it can be advantageous to have the score closely approximate the gradient of the actual potential energy surface. Unlike conventional methods that simply design the target score based on structural differences in Euclidean space, we propose a Riemannian score matching approach. This method represents molecular structures on a manifold defined by physics-informed internal coordinates to efficiently mimic the energy landscape, and performs noising and denoising within this space. Our method has been evaluated by refining several types of starting structures on the QM9 and GEOM datasets, demonstrating that the proposed Riemannian score matching method significantly improves the accuracy of the generated molecular structures, attaining chemical accuracy. The implications of this study extend to various applications in computational chemistry, offering a robust tool for accurate molecular structure prediction.</p></details> |  |

| **[Balancing Molecular Information and Empirical Data in the Prediction of Physico-Chemical Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08075v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the physico-chemical properties of pure substances and mixtures is a central task in thermodynamics. Established prediction methods range from fully physics-based ab-initio calculations, which are only feasible for very simple systems, over descriptor-based methods that use some information on the molecules to be modeled together with fitted model parameters (e.g., quantitative-structure-property relationship methods or classical group contribution methods), to representation-learning methods, which may, in extreme cases, completely ignore molecular descriptors and extrapolate only from existing data on the property to be modeled (e.g., matrix completion methods). In this work, we propose a general method for combining molecular descriptors with representation learning using the so-called expectation maximization algorithm from the probabilistic machine learning literature, which uses uncertainty estimates to trade off between the two approaches. The proposed hybrid model exploits chemical structure information using graph neural networks, but it automatically detects cases where structure-based predictions are unreliable, in which case it corrects them by representation-learning based predictions that can better specialize to unusual cases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the prediction of activity coefficients in binary mixtures as an example. The results are compelling, as the method significantly improves predictive accuracy over the current state of the art, showcasing its potential to advance the prediction of physico-chemical properties in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, including 11 pages of main text and 3 pages of appendix, added analysis of improvements in predictive accuracy, added Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7</p></details> |

Flow matching is a recently proposed generative modeling framework that has achieved impressive performance on a variety of tasks including those on biomolecular structures. The seminal flow matching framework was developed only for continuous data. However, de novo molecular design tasks require generating discrete data such as atomic elements or sequences of amino acid residues. Several discrete flow matching methods have been proposed recently to address this gap. In this work we benchmark the performance of existing discrete flow matching methods for 3D de novo small molecule generation and provide explanations of their differing behavior. As a result we present FlowMol-CTMC, an open-source model that achieves state of the art performance for 3D de novo design with fewer learnable parameters than existing methods. Additionally, we propose the use of metrics that capture molecule quality beyond local chemical valency constraints and towards higher-order structural motifs. These metrics show that even though basic constraints are satisfied, the models tend to produce unusual and potentially problematic functional groups outside of the training data distribution. Code and trained models for reproducing this work are available at \url{https://github.com/dunni3/FlowMol}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the NeurIPS 2024 Machine Learning for Structural Biology Workshop</p></details> |

By precisely encoding the molecular space and score functions, e.g., a graph neural network, the molecular design problem is represented and solved as an optimization problem, the solution of which corresponds to a molecule with optimal score. However, both the extremely large search space and complicated scoring process limit the use of MIP-based CAMD to specific and tiny problems. Moreover, optimal molecule may not be meaningful in practice if scores are imperfect. Instead of pursuing optimality, this paper exploits the ability of MIP in molecular generation and proposes Limeade as an end-to-end tool from real-world needs to feasible molecules. Beyond the basic constraints for structural feasibility, Limeade supports inclusion and exclusion of SMARTS patterns, automating the process of interpreting and formulating chemical requirements to mathematical constraints.</p></details> | 32 pages, 2 figures |

However, molecules are not solely characterized by atom/bond symbols; they encapsulate important physical/chemical properties. Moreover, normal language models bring grammar rules that are irrelevant for understanding molecules. In this study, we propose a novel physicochemical knowledge-guided molecular meta language framework MolMetaLM. We design a molecule-specialized meta language paradigm, formatted as multiple <S,P,O> (subject, predicate, object) knowledge triples sharing the same S (i.e., molecule) to enhance learning the semantic relationships between physicochemical knowledge and molecules. By introducing different molecular knowledge and noises, the meta language paradigm generates tens of thousands of pretraining tasks. By recovering the token/sequence/order-level noises, MolMetaLM exhibits proficiency in large-scale benchmark evaluations involving property prediction, molecule generation, conformation inference, and molecular optimization. Through MolMetaLM, we offer a new insight for designing language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Practical and Asymptotically Exact Conditional Sampling in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17775v2)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been successful on a range of conditional generation tasks including molecular design and text-to-image generation. However, these achievements have primarily depended on task-specific conditional training or error-prone heuristic approximations. Ideally, a conditional generation method should provide exact samples for a broad range of conditional distributions without requiring task-specific training. To this end, we introduce the Twisted Diffusion Sampler, or TDS. TDS is a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that targets the conditional distributions of diffusion models through simulating a set of weighted particles. The main idea is to use twisting, an SMC technique that enjoys good computational efficiency, to incorporate heuristic approximations without compromising asymptotic exactness. We first find in simulation and in conditional image generation tasks that TDS provides a computational statistical trade-off, yielding more accurate approximations with many particles but with empirical improvements over heuristics with as few as two particles. We then turn to motif-scaffolding, a core task in protein design, using a TDS extension to Riemannian diffusion models. On benchmark test cases, TDS allows flexible conditioning criteria and often outperforms the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/blt2114/twisted_diffusion_sampler</p></details> |

Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods often overlook structural information. However, feature engineering-based methods usually merely focus on binding affinity prediction without substantial molecular modification. To address this, we present Graph-based Topological Reinforcement Learning (GraphTRL), which integrates both chemical and structural data for improved molecular generation. GraphTRL leverages multiscale weighted colored graphs (MWCG) and persistent homology, combined with molecular fingerprints, as the state space for RL. Evaluations show that GraphTRL outperforms existing methods in binding affinity prediction, offering a promising approach to accelerate drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolReFlect: Towards In-Context Fine-grained Alignments between Molecules and Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14721v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecule discovery is a pivotal research field, impacting everything from the medicines we take to the materials we use. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in molecule understanding and generation, yet the alignments between molecules and their corresponding captions remain a significant challenge. Previous endeavours often treat the molecule as a general SMILES string or molecular graph, neglecting the fine-grained alignments between the molecular sub-structures and the descriptive textual phrases, which are crucial for accurate and explainable predictions. In this case, we introduce MolReFlect, a novel teacher-student framework designed to contextually perform the molecule-caption alignments in a fine-grained way. Our approach initially leverages a larger teacher LLM to label the detailed alignments by directly extracting critical phrases from molecule captions or SMILES strings and implying them to corresponding sub-structures or characteristics. To refine these alignments, we propose In-Context Selective Reflection, which retrieves previous extraction results as context examples for teacher LLM to reflect and lets a smaller student LLM select from in-context reflection and previous extraction results. Finally, we enhance the learning process of the student LLM through Chain-of-Thought In-Context Molecule Tuning, integrating the fine-grained alignments and the reasoning processes within the Chain-of-Thought format. Our experimental results demonstrate that MolReFlect enables LLMs like Mistral-7B to significantly outperform the previous baselines, achieving SOTA performance on the ChEBI-20 dataset. This advancement not only enhances the generative capabilities of LLMs in the molecule-caption translation task, but also contributes to a more explainable framework.</p></details> | 22 pages, 12 figures |

Recently, ligand-based virtual screening has garnered significant attention due to its efficacy in conducting extensive database screenings without relying on specific protein-binding site information. Obtaining binding affinity data for complexes is highly expensive, resulting in a limited amount of available data that covers a relatively small chemical space. Moreover, these datasets contain a significant amount of inconsistent noise. It is challenging to identify an inductive bias that consistently maintains the integrity of molecular activity during data augmentation. To tackle these challenges, we propose S-MolSearch, the first framework to our knowledge, that leverages molecular 3D information and affinity information in semi-supervised contrastive learning for ligand-based virtual screening. Drawing on the principles of inverse optimal transport, S-MolSearch efficiently processes both labeled and unlabeled data, training molecular structural encoders while generating soft labels for the unlabeled data. This design allows S-MolSearch to adaptively utilize unlabeled data within the learning process. Empirically, S-MolSearch demonstrates superior performance on widely-used benchmarks LIT-PCBA and DUD-E. It surpasses both structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening methods for AUROC, BEDROC and EF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molecule Generation with Fragment Retrieval Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12078v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fragment-based drug discovery, in which molecular fragments are assembled into new molecules with desirable biochemical properties, has achieved great success. However, many fragment-based molecule generation methods show limited exploration beyond the existing fragments in the database as they only reassemble or slightly modify the given ones. To tackle this problem, we propose a new fragment-based molecule generation framework with retrieval augmentation, namely Fragment Retrieval-Augmented Generation (f-RAG). f-RAG is based on a pre-trained molecular generative model that proposes additional fragments from input fragments to complete and generate a new molecule. Given a fragment vocabulary, f-RAG retrieves two types of fragments: (1) hard fragments, which serve as building blocks that will be explicitly included in the newly generated molecule, and (2) soft fragments, which serve as reference to guide the generation of new fragments through a trainable fragment injection module. To extrapolate beyond the existing fragments, f-RAG updates the fragment vocabulary with generated fragments via an iterative refinement process which is further enhanced with post-hoc genetic fragment modification. f-RAG can achieve an improved exploration-exploitation trade-off by maintaining a pool of fragments and expanding it with novel and high-quality fragments through a strong generative prior.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

In this study, we introduce a neuroevolution potential (NEP), trained on a dataset generated from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, using the moment tensor potential (MTP) as a reference. The low root mean square errors (RMSEs) for total energy and atomic forces demonstrate the high accuracy and transferability of both the MTP and NEP. We further calculate the phonon density of states (DOS) and radial distribution function (RDF) using both machine learning potentials, comparing the results to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the MTP potential offers slightly higher accuracy, the NEP achieves a remarkable 41-fold increase in computational speed. These findings provide detailed microscopic insights into the dynamics and rapid Cu-ion diffusion, paving the way for future studies on Cu-based solid electrolytes and their applications in energy devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the mold: overcoming the time constraints of molecular dynamics on general-purpose hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10532v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been intimately linked to that of computing hardware. For decades following the creation of MD, simulations have improved with computing power along the three principal dimensions of accuracy, atom count (spatial scale), and duration (temporal scale). Since the mid-2000s, computer platforms have however failed to provide strong scaling for MD as scale-out CPU and GPU platforms that provide substantial increases to spatial scale do not lead to proportional increases in temporal scale. Important scientific problems therefore remained inaccessible to direct simulation, prompting the development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms that present significant complexity, accuracy, and efficiency challenges. While bespoke MD-only hardware solutions have provided a path to longer timescales for specific physical systems, their impact on the broader community has been mitigated by their limited adaptability to new methods and potentials. In this work, we show that a novel computing architecture, the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine, completely alters the scaling path by delivering unprecedentedly high simulation rates up to 1.144M steps/second for 200,000 atoms whose interactions are described by an Embedded Atom Method potential. This enables direct simulations of the evolution of materials using general-purpose programmable hardware over millisecond timescales, dramatically increasing the space of direct MD simulations that can be carried out.</p></details> |  |

Despite the popularity of probabilistic generative models, numerical experiments benchmarking their performance on molecular data are lacking. In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: Neural Spline Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) Neural Spline Flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) Conditional Flow Matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models appears the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib\textsubscript{9} peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope our taxonomy of probabilistic generative frameworks and numerical results may guide model selection for a wide range of molecular tasks.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, it does not extract key substructures from a single patient visit, resulting in the failure to identify medication molecules suitable for the current patient visit. To address the above limitations, we propose a bimodal molecular recommendation framework named BiMoRec, which introduces 3D molecular structures to obtain atomic 3D coordinates and edge indices, overcoming the inherent lack of high-dimensional molecular information in 2D molecular structures. To retain the fast training and prediction efficiency of the recommendation system, we use bimodal graph contrastive pretraining to maximize the mutual information between the two molecular modalities, achieving the fusion of 2D and 3D molecular graphs. Additionally, we designed a molecular multi-step enhancement mechanism to re-calibrate the molecular weights. Specifically, we employ a pre-training method that captures both 2D and 3D molecular structure representations, along with substructure representations, and leverages contrastive learning to extract mutual information. We then use the pre-trained encoder to generate molecular representations, enhancing them through a three-step process: intra-visit, molecular per-visit, and latest-visit. Finally, we apply temporal information aggregation to generate the final medication combinations. Our implementation on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

These models have been developed inheriting from the advances in natural language processing and computer vision, achieving ever greater results. However, generative molecular modelling has unique challenges that are often overlooked. Chemical validity, interpretability of the generation process and flexibility to variable molecular sizes are among some of the remaining challenges for generative models in computational materials design. In this work, we propose an autoregressive approach that decomposes molecular generation into a sequence of discrete and interpretable steps using molecular fragments as units, a 'molecular story'. Enforcing chemical rules in the stories guarantees the chemical validity of the generated molecules, the discrete sequential steps of a molecular story makes the process transparent improving interpretability, and the autoregressive nature of the approach allows the size of the molecule to be a decision of the model. We demonstrate the validity of the approach in a multi-target inverse design of electroactive organic compounds, focusing on the target properties of solubility, redox potential, and synthetic accessibility. Our results show that the model can effectively bias the generation distribution according to the prompted multi-target objective.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present an exhaustive review of the latest advancements in graph representation learning and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, tailored to handle graph-structured data, excel in deriving insights and predictions from intricate relational information, making them invaluable for tasks involving such data. Graph representation learning, a pivotal approach in analyzing graph-structured data, facilitates numerous downstream tasks and applications across machine learning, data mining, biomedicine, and healthcare. Our work delves into the capabilities of GNNs, examining their foundational designs and their application in addressing real-world challenges.

This pooling function significantly enhances the GNN's efficacy in both node- and graph-level tasks. Additionally, we propose a molecular graph generative model with a GNN as its core framework. This GNN backbone is proficient in learning invariant and equivariant molecular characteristics. Employing these features, the molecular graph generative model is capable of simultaneously learning and generating molecular graphs with atom-bond structures and precise atom positions.

However, the molecular generation process with diffusion models involves multiple autoregressive steps over a finite time horizon, leading to exposure bias issues inherently. To address the exposure bias issue, we propose a training framework named GapDiff. The core idea of GapDiff is to utilize model-predicted conformations as ground truth probabilistically during training, aiming to mitigate the data distributional disparity between training and inference, thereby enhancing the affinity of generated molecules. We conduct experiments using a 3D molecular generation model on the CrossDocked2020 dataset, and the vina energy and diversity demonstrate the potency of our framework with superior affinity.

However, most existing machine learning methods for small molecule generation suffer from poor synthesizability of candidate compounds, making experimental validation difficult. In this paper we propose Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), an extension of the GFlowNet framework that operates directly in the space of chemical reactions, thereby allowing out-of-the-box synthesizability while maintaining comparable quality of generated candidates. We demonstrate that with the proposed set of reactions and building blocks, it is possible to obtain a search space of molecules orders of magnitude larger than existing screening libraries coupled with low cost of synthesis. We also show that the approach scales to very large fragment libraries, further increasing the number of potential molecules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across a range of oracle models, including pretrained proxy models and GPU-accelerated docking.</p></details> |  |

These models demonstrate strong performance on a range of tasks; however, there has been evidence of brittleness when applied to more niche or narrow domains where hallucinations or fluent but incorrect responses reduce performance. Given the complex nature of scientific domains, it is prudent to investigate the trade-offs of leveraging off-the-shelf versus more targeted foundation models for scientific domains. In this work, we examine the benefits of in-domain pre-training for a given scientific domain, chemistry, and compare these to open-source, off-the-shelf models with zero-shot and few-shot prompting. Our results show that not only do in-domain base models perform reasonably well on in-domain tasks in a zero-shot setting but that further adaptation using instruction fine-tuning yields impressive performance on chemistry-specific tasks such as named entity recognition and molecular formula generation.</p></details> |  |

The junction tree variational autoencoder (JTVAE) has been shown to be an efficient generative model that can be used for suggesting legitimate novel drug-like small molecules with improved properties. While the performance of the generative molecular design (GMD) scheme strongly depends on the initial training data, one can improve its sampling efficiency for suggesting better molecules with enhanced properties by optimizing the latent space. In this work, we propose how mechanistic models - such as pathway models described by differential equations - can be used for effective latent space optimization(LSO) of JTVAEs and other similar models for GMD. To demonstrate the potential of our proposed approach, we show how a pharmacodynamic model, assessing the therapeutic efficacy of a drug-like small molecule by predicting how it modulates a cancer pathway, can be incorporated for effective LSO of data-driven models for GMD.</p></details> |  |

Active learning, which uses biased or unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) to generate candidate pools, aims to address this objective. Existing biased and unbiased MD-simulation methods, however, are prone to miss either rare events or extrapolative regions -- areas of the configurational space where unreliable predictions are made. This work demonstrates that MD, when biased by the MLIP's energy uncertainty, simultaneously captures extrapolative regions and rare events, which is crucial for developing uniformly accurate MLIPs. Furthermore, exploiting automatic differentiation, we enhance bias-forces-driven MD with the concept of bias stress. We employ calibrated gradient-based uncertainties to yield MLIPs with similar or, sometimes, better accuracy than ensemble-based methods at a lower computational cost. Finally, we apply uncertainty-biased MD to alanine dipeptide and MIL-53(Al), generating MLIPs that represent both configurational spaces more accurately than models trained with conventional MD.</p></details> |  |

However, conditional molecular generation remains a fundamental challenge due to an intrinsic trade-off between targeting specific chemical properties and generating meaningful samples from the data distribution. In this work, we present Time-Aware Conditional Synthesis (TACS), a novel approach to conditional generation on diffusion models. It integrates adaptively controlled plug-and-play "online" guidance into a diffusion model, driving samples toward the desired properties while maintaining validity and stability. A key component of our algorithm is our new type of diffusion sampler, Time Correction Sampler (TCS), which is used to control guidance and ensure that the generated molecules remain on the correct manifold at each reverse step of the diffusion process at the same time. Our proposed method demonstrates significant performance in conditional 3D molecular generation and offers a promising approach towards inverse molecular design, potentially facilitating advancements in drug discovery, materials science, and other related fields.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

The advancements in LLMs and instruction tuning have led to the development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, the competency of the LLMs and instruction tuning have been less explored in the molecular domain. Thus, we propose LLaMo: Large Language Model-based Molecular graph assistant, which is an end-to-end trained large molecular graph-language model. To bridge the discrepancy between the language and graph modalities, we present the multi-level graph projector that transforms graph representations into graph tokens by abstracting the output representations of each GNN layer and motif representations with the cross-attention mechanism. We also introduce machine-generated molecular graph instruction data to instruction-tune the large molecular graph-language model for general-purpose molecule and language understanding.

| **[Fisher Flow Matching for Generative Modeling over Discrete Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14664v4)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling over discrete data has recently seen numerous success stories, with applications spanning language modeling, biological sequence design, and graph-structured molecular data. The predominant generative modeling paradigm for discrete data is still autoregressive, with more recent alternatives based on diffusion or flow-matching falling short of their impressive performance in continuous data settings, such as image or video generation. In this work, we introduce Fisher-Flow, a novel flow-matching model for discrete data. Fisher-Flow takes a manifestly geometric perspective by considering categorical distributions over discrete data as points residing on a statistical manifold equipped with its natural Riemannian metric: the $\textit{Fisher-Rao metric}$. As a result, we demonstrate discrete data itself can be continuously reparameterised to points on the positive orthant of the $d$-hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^d_+$, which allows us to define flows that map any source distribution to target in a principled manner by transporting mass along (closed-form) geodesics of $\mathbb{S}^d_+$. Furthermore, the learned flows in Fisher-Flow can be further bootstrapped by leveraging Riemannian optimal transport leading to improved training dynamics. We prove that the gradient flow induced by Fisher-Flow is optimal in reducing the forward KL divergence. We evaluate Fisher-Flow on an array of synthetic and diverse real-world benchmarks, including designing DNA Promoter, and DNA Enhancer sequences.

| **[ET-Flow: Equivariant Flow-Matching for Molecular Conformer Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22388v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting low-energy molecular conformations given a molecular graph is an important but challenging task in computational drug discovery. Existing state-of-the-art approaches either resort to large scale transformer-based models that diffuse over conformer fields, or use computationally expensive methods to generate initial structures and diffuse over torsion angles. In this work, we introduce Equivariant Transformer Flow (ET-Flow). We showcase that a well-designed flow matching approach with equivariance and harmonic prior alleviates the need for complex internal geometry calculations and large architectures, contrary to the prevailing methods in the field. Our approach results in a straightforward and scalable method that directly operates on all-atom coordinates with minimal assumptions. With the advantages of equivariance and flow matching, ET-Flow significantly increases the precision and physical validity of the generated conformers, while being a lighter model and faster at inference.

In this work, we observe that GFlowNets tend to under-exploit the high-reward objects due to training on insufficient number of trajectories, which may lead to a large gap between the estimated flow and the (known) reward value. In response to this challenge, we propose a pessimistic backward policy for GFlowNets (PBP-GFN), which maximizes the observed flow to align closely with the true reward for the object. We extensively evaluate PBP-GFN across eight benchmarks, including hyper-grid environment, bag generation, structured set generation, molecular generation, and four RNA sequence generation tasks. In particular, PBP-GFN enhances the discovery of high-reward objects, maintains the diversity of the objects, and consistently outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Blurring Diffusion for Hierarchical Molecular Conformer Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20255v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can diffusion models process 3D geometries in a coarse-to-fine manner, akin to our multiscale view of the world? In this paper, we address the question by focusing on a fundamental biochemical problem of generating 3D molecular conformers conditioned on molecular graphs in a multiscale manner. Our approach consists of two hierarchical stages: i) generation of coarse-grained fragment-level 3D structure from the molecular graph, and ii) generation of fine atomic details from the coarse-grained approximated structure while allowing the latter to be adjusted simultaneously. For the challenging second stage, which demands preserving coarse-grained information while ensuring SE(3) equivariance, we introduce a novel generative model termed Equivariant Blurring Diffusion (EBD), which defines a forward process that moves towards the fragment-level coarse-grained structure by blurring the fine atomic details of conformers, and a reverse process that performs the opposite operation using equivariant networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EBD by geometric and chemical comparison to state-of-the-art denoising diffusion models on a benchmark of drug-like molecules. Ablation studies draw insights on the design of EBD by thoroughly analyzing its architecture, which includes the design of the loss function and the data corruption process. Codes are released at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/EBD .</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

To address this, the Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) representation was recently introduced as an alternative that streamlines those tasks. In this study, we investigate the optimal setups for training SAFE generative models, focusing on dataset size, data augmentation through randomization, model architecture, and bond disconnection algorithms. We found that larger, more diverse datasets improve performance, with the LLaMA architecture using Rotary Positional Embedding proving most robust. SAFE-based models also consistently outperform SMILES-based approaches in scaffold decoration and linker design, particularly with BRICS decomposition yielding the best results. These insights highlight key factors that significantly impact the efficacy of SAFE-based generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chemical Language Model Linker: blending text and molecules with modular adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20182v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models and multi-modal models has enabled the appealing idea of generating novel molecules from text descriptions. Generative modeling would shift the paradigm from relying on large-scale chemical screening to find molecules with desired properties to directly generating those molecules. However, multi-modal models combining text and molecules are often trained from scratch, without leveraging existing high-quality pretrained models. That approach consumes more computational resources and prohibits model scaling. In contrast, we propose a lightweight adapter-based strategy named Chemical Language Model Linker (ChemLML). ChemLML blends the two single domain models and obtains conditional molecular generation from text descriptions while still operating in the specialized embedding spaces of the molecular domain. ChemLML can tailor diverse pretrained text models for molecule generation by training relatively few adapter parameters. We find that the choice of molecular representation used within ChemLML, SMILES versus SELFIES, has a strong influence on conditional molecular generation performance. SMILES is often preferable despite not guaranteeing valid molecules. We raise issues in using the large PubChem dataset of molecules and their associated descriptions for evaluating molecule generation and provide a filtered version of the dataset as a generation test set. To demonstrate how ChemLML could be used in practice, we generate candidate protein inhibitors and use docking to assess their quality.</p></details> | 25 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Generative Design of Functional Metal Complexes Utilizing the Internal Knowledge of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18136v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing functional transition metal complexes (TMCs) faces challenges due to the vast search space of metals and ligands, requiring efficient optimization strategies. Traditional genetic algorithms (GAs) are commonly used, employing random mutations and crossovers driven by explicit mathematical objectives to explore this space. Transferring knowledge between different GA tasks, however, is difficult. We integrate large language models (LLMs) into the evolutionary optimization framework (LLM-EO) and apply it in both single- and multi-objective optimization for TMCs. We find that LLM-EO surpasses traditional GAs by leveraging the chemical knowledge of LLMs gained during their extensive pretraining. Remarkably, without supervised fine-tuning, LLMs utilize the full historical data from optimization processes, outperforming those focusing only on top-performing TMCs. LLM-EO successfully identifies eight of the top-20 TMCs with the largest HOMO-LUMO gaps by proposing only 200 candidates out of a 1.37 million TMCs space. Through prompt engineering using natural language, LLM-EO introduces unparalleled flexibility into multi-objective optimizations, thereby circumventing the necessity for intricate mathematical formulations. As generative models, LLMs can suggest new ligands and TMCs with unique properties by merging both internal knowledge and external chemistry data, thus combining the benefits of efficient optimization and molecular generation. With increasing potential of LLMs as pretrained foundational models and new post-training inference strategies, we foresee broad applications of LLM-based evolutionary optimization in chemistry and materials design.</p></details> |  |

Such virtual screening depends in part on methods to predict the binding affinity between ligands and proteins. Many computational models for binding affinity prediction have been developed, but with varying results across targets. Given that ensembling or meta-modeling approaches have shown great promise in reducing model-specific biases, we develop a framework to integrate published force-field-based empirical docking and sequence-based deep learning models. In building this framework, we evaluate many combinations of individual base models, training databases, and several meta-modeling approaches. We show that many of our meta-models significantly improve affinity predictions over base models. Our best meta-models achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art deep learning tools exclusively based on 3D structures, while allowing for improved database scalability and flexibility through the explicit inclusion of features such as physicochemical properties or molecular descriptors. We further demonstrate improved generalization capability by our models using a large-scale benchmark of affinity prediction as well as a virtual screening application benchmark. Overall, we demonstrate that diverse modeling approaches can be ensembled together to gain meaningful improvement in binding affinity prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 6 main tables, 6 main figures, 8 supplementary figures, and supporting information.

Current techniques for sampling ensembles are computationally inefficient, or do not transfer to systems outside their training data. We present walk-Jump Accelerated Molecular ensembles with Universal Noise (JAMUN), a step towards the goal of efficiently sampling the Boltzmann distribution of arbitrary proteins. By extending Walk-Jump Sampling to point clouds, JAMUN enables ensemble generation at orders of magnitude faster rates than traditional molecular dynamics or state-of-the-art ML methods. Further, JAMUN is able to predict the stable basins of small peptides that were not seen during training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Guided Multi-Property Molecular Optimization with a Diffusion Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13597v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization (MO) is a crucial stage in drug discovery in which task-oriented generated molecules are optimized to meet practical industrial requirements. Existing mainstream MO approaches primarily utilize external property predictors to guide iterative property optimization. However, learning all molecular samples in the vast chemical space is unrealistic for predictors. As a result, errors and noise are inevitably introduced during property prediction due to the nature of approximation. This leads to discrepancy accumulation, generalization reduction and suboptimal molecular candidates. In this paper, we propose a text-guided multi-property molecular optimization method utilizing transformer-based diffusion language model (TransDLM). TransDLM leverages standardized chemical nomenclature as semantic representations of molecules and implicitly embeds property requirements into textual descriptions, thereby preventing error propagation during diffusion process. Guided by physically and chemically detailed textual descriptions, TransDLM samples and optimizes encoded source molecules, retaining core scaffolds of source molecules and ensuring structural similarities. Moreover, TransDLM enables simultaneous sampling of multiple molecules, making it ideal for scalable, efficient large-scale optimization through distributed computation on web platforms. Furthermore, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in optimizing molecular structural similarity and enhancing chemical properties on the benchmark dataset.

In particular, designing molecules satisfying multi-parameter optimization objectives, while simultaneously being synthesizable and enforcing the presence of specific commercial building blocks in the synthesis. This is practically important for molecule re-purposing, sustainability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel reward function called TANimoto Group Overlap (TANGO), which uses chemistry principles to transform a sparse reward function into a dense and learnable reward function -- crucial for reinforcement learning. TANGO can augment general-purpose molecular generative models to directly optimize for constrained synthesizability while simultaneously optimizing for other properties relevant to drug discovery using reinforcement learning. Our framework is general and addresses starting-material, intermediate, and divergent synthesis constraints. Contrary to most existing works in the field, we show that incentivizing a general-purpose (without any inductive biases) model is a productive approach to navigating challenging optimization scenarios. We demonstrate this by showing that the trained models explicitly learn a desirable distribution. Our framework is the first generative approach to tackle constrained synthesizability.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we expand upon KANO by integrating the large-scale ChEBI knowledge graph, which includes 2,840 functional groups -- significantly more than the original 82 used in KANO. We explore two approaches, Replace and Integrate, to incorporate this extensive knowledge into the KANO framework. Our results demonstrate that including ChEBI leads to improved performance on 9 out of 14 molecular property prediction datasets.

Traditionally, watermarking techniques have been developed primarily for rich information media such as images and audio. However, these methods have not been adequately adapted for graph-based data, particularly molecular graphs. Latent 3D graph diffusion(LDM-3DG) is an ascendant approach in the molecular graph generation field. This model effectively manages the complexities of molecular structures, preserving essential symmetries and topological features. We adapt the Gaussian Shading, a proven performance lossless watermarking technique, to the latent graph diffusion domain to protect this sophisticated new technology. Our adaptation simplifies the watermark diffusion process through duplication and padding, making it adaptable and suitable for various message types. We conduct several experiments using the LDM-3DG model on publicly available datasets QM9 and Drugs, to assess the robustness and effectiveness of our technique. Our results demonstrate that the watermarked molecules maintain statistical parity in 9 out of 10 performance metrics compared to the original. Moreover, they exhibit a 100% detection rate and a 99% extraction rate in a 2D decoded pipeline, while also showing robustness against post-editing attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models mostly work with SMILES and SELFIES chemical string representations, which lack spatial features vital for drug discovery. Additionally, attempts to translate chemical 3D structures into text format encounter issues such as excessive length and insufficient atom connectivity information. To address these issues, we introduce nach0-pc, a model combining domain-specific encoder and textual representation to handle spatial arrangement of atoms effectively. Our approach utilizes a molecular point cloud encoder for concise and order-invariant structure representation. We introduce a novel pre-training scheme for molecular point clouds to distillate the knowledge from spatial molecular structures datasets. After fine-tuning within both single-task and multi-task frameworks, nach0-pc demonstrates performance comparable with other diffusion models in terms of generated samples quality across several established spatial molecular generation tasks. Notably, our model is a multi-task approach, in contrast to diffusion models being limited to single tasks. Additionally, it is capable of processing point cloud-related data, which language models are not capable of handling due to memory limitations. These lead to our model having reduced training and inference time while maintaining on par performance.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce a multi-constraint molecular generation large language model, TSMMG, which, akin to a student, incorporates knowledge from various small models and tools, namely, the 'teachers'. To train TSMMG, we construct a large set of text-molecule pairs by extracting molecular knowledge from these 'teachers', enabling it to generate novel molecules that conform to the descriptions through various text prompts. We experimentally show that TSMMG remarkably performs in generating molecules meeting complex, natural language-described property requirements across two-, three-, and four-constraint tasks, with an average molecular validity of over 99% and success ratio of 82.58%, 68.03%, and 67.48%, respectively. The model also exhibits adaptability through zero-shot testing, creating molecules that satisfy combinations of properties that have not been encountered. It can comprehend text inputs with various language styles, extending beyond the confines of outlined prompts, as confirmed through empirical validation. Additionally, the knowledge distillation feature of TSMMG contributes to the continuous enhancement of small models, while the innovative approach to dataset construction effectively addresses the issues of data scarcity and quality, which positions TSMMG as a promising tool in the domains of drug discovery and materials science.</p></details> | 37 pages, 10 figures |

The packing structure of these materials plays a crucial role in determining their electronic and transport properties, which are key to enhancing the efficiency of devices like organic solar cells (OSCs). However, obtaining these optoelectronic properties computationally requires molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to generate a conformational ensemble, a process that can be computationally expensive due to the large system sizes involved. Recent advances have focused on using generative models, particularly flow-based models as Boltzmann generators, to improve the efficiency of MD sampling. In this work, we developed a dual-scale flow matching method that separates training and inference into coarse-grained and all-atom stages and enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of standard flow matching samplers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a dataset of Y6 molecular clusters obtained through MD simulations, and we benchmark its efficiency and accuracy against single-scale flow matching methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose StructCoT, a structure-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) that enhances LLMs' understanding of molecular structures by explicitly injecting the key structural features of molecules. Moreover, we introduce two fine-tuning frameworks for adapting the existing LLMs to use our StructCoT. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating StructCoT with our fine-tuning frameworks leads to consistent improvements in both molecular understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

DiGress is a recent diffusion model for molecular graphs whose distinctive feature is allowing property targeting through classifier-based (CB) guidance. While CB guidance may work to generate molecular-like graphs, we hint at the fact that its assumptions apply poorly to the chemical domain. Based on this insight we propose a classifier-free DiGress (FreeGress), which works by directly injecting the conditioning information into the training process. CF guidance is convenient given its less stringent assumptions and since it does not require to train an auxiliary property regressor, thus halving the number of trainable parameters in the model. We empirically show that our model yields up to 79% improvement in Mean Absolute Error with respect to DiGress on property targeting tasks on QM9 and ZINC-250k benchmarks. As an additional contribution, we propose a simple yet powerful approach to improve chemical validity of generated samples, based on the observation that certain chemical properties such as molecular weight correlate with the number of atoms in molecules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ECML PKDD 2024</p></details> |

We introduce generative modeling of molecular trajectories as a paradigm for learning flexible multi-task surrogate models of MD from data. By conditioning on appropriately chosen frames of the trajectory, we show such generative models can be adapted to diverse tasks such as forward simulation, transition path sampling, and trajectory upsampling. By alternatively conditioning on part of the molecular system and inpainting the rest, we also demonstrate the first steps towards dynamics-conditioned molecular design. We validate the full set of these capabilities on tetrapeptide simulations and show that our model can produce reasonable ensembles of protein monomers.

The use of a discriminator to guide a diffusion process has previously been used for continuous diffusion models, and in this work we derive ways of using a discriminator together with a pretrained generative model in the discrete case. First, we show that using an optimal discriminator will correct the pretrained model and enable exact sampling from the underlying data distribution. Second, to account for the realistic scenario of using a sub-optimal discriminator, we derive a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm which iteratively takes the predictions from the discriminator into account during the generation process. We test these approaches on the task of generating molecular graphs and show how the discriminator improves the generative performance over using only the pretrained model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AISTATS 2024, official proceedings available at https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/ekstrom-kelvinius24a.html.

| **[Mitigating Exposure Bias in Score-Based Generation of Molecular Conformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14014v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular conformation generation poses a significant challenge in the field of computational chemistry. Recently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) are effectively used due to their capacity for generating accurate conformations far beyond conventional physics-based approaches. However, the discrepancy between training and inference rises a critical problem known as the exposure bias. While this issue has been extensively investigated in DPMs, the existence of exposure bias in SGMs and its effective measurement remain unsolved, which hinders the use of compensation methods for SGMs, including ConfGF and Torsional Diffusion as the representatives. In this work, we first propose a method for measuring exposure bias in SGMs used for molecular conformation generation, which confirms the significant existence of exposure bias in these models and measures its value. We design a new compensation algorithm Input Perturbation (IP), which is adapted from a method originally designed for DPMs only. Experimental results show that by introducing IP, SGM-based molecular conformation models can significantly improve both the accuracy and diversity of the generated conformations. Especially by using the IP-enhanced Torsional Diffusion model, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the GEOM-Drugs dataset and are on par on GEOM-QM9. We provide the code publicly at https://github.com/jia-975/torsionalDiff-ip.</p></details> | SMC 2024 |

Existing autoregressive models such as G-SchNet and G-SphereNet for molecules utilize rotationally invariant features to respect the 3D symmetries of molecules. In contrast, Symphony uses message-passing with higher-degree $E(3)$-equivariant features. This allows a novel representation of probability distributions via spherical harmonic signals to efficiently model the 3D geometry of molecules. We show that Symphony is able to accurately generate small molecules from the QM9 dataset, outperforming existing autoregressive models and approaching the performance of diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Despite these advances, several fundamental questions remain unanswered as the field increasingly focuses on more complex generative models and sophisticated molecular representations as an answer to the challenges of drug design. In this paper, we return to the simplest representation of molecules, and investigate overlooked limitations of classical generative approaches, particularly Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and auto-regressive models. We propose a hybrid model in the form of a novel regularizer that leverages the strengths of both to improve validity, conditional generation, and style transfer of molecular sequences. Additionally, we provide an in depth discussion of overlooked assumptions of these models' behaviour.</p></details> |  |

When certain entities exist across multiple systems simultaneously, unveiling their corresponding relationships across the networks becomes crucial. This problem, known as network alignment, holds significant importance. It enhances our understanding of complex system structures and behaviours, facilitates the validation and extension of theoretical physics research about studying complex systems, and fosters diverse practical applications across various fields. However, due to variations in the structure, characteristics, and properties of complex networks across different fields, the study of network alignment is often isolated within each domain, with even the terminologies and concepts lacking uniformity. This review comprehensively summarizes the latest advancements in network alignment research, focusing on analyzing network alignment characteristics and progress in various domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, computational linguistics and privacy protection. It provides a detailed analysis of various methods' implementation principles, processes, and performance differences, including structure consistency-based methods, network embedding-based methods, and graph neural network-based (GNN-based) methods. Additionally, the methods for network alignment under different conditions, such as in attributed networks, heterogeneous networks, directed networks, and dynamic networks, are presented. Furthermore, the challenges and the open issues for future studies are also discussed.</p></details> |  |

The results can then be further improved with re-ranking methods that re-order the top scoring images. However, existing methods focus on re-ranking based on the same image descriptors that were used for the initial retrieval, which we argue provides limited additional signal. In this work we propose Generalized Contextual Similarity Aggregation (GCSA), which is a graph neural network-based re-ranking method that, in addition to the visual descriptors, can leverage other types of available side information. This can for example be other sensor data (such as signal strength of nearby WiFi or BlueTooth endpoints) or geometric properties such as camera poses for database images. In many applications this information is already present or can be acquired with low effort. Our architecture leverages the concept of affinity vectors to allow for a shared encoding of the heterogeneous multi-modal input. Two large-scale datasets, covering both outdoor and indoor localization scenarios, are utilized for training and evaluation. In experiments we show significant improvement not only on image retrieval metrics, but also for the downstream visual localization task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis (SCIA) 2025</p></details> |

However, attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors and their risks have rarely been studied, thereby leaving potential threats unaddressed. Recent findings suggest that frauds are increasingly organized as gangs or groups. In this work, we design attack scenarios where fraud gangs aim to make their fraud nodes misclassified as benign by camouflaging their illicit activities in collusion. Based on these scenarios, we study adversarial attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors by simulating attacks of fraud gangs in three real-world fraud cases: spam reviews, fake news, and medical insurance frauds. We define these attacks as multi-target graph injection attacks and propose MonTi, a transformer-based Multi-target one-Time graph injection attack model. MonTi simultaneously generates attributes and edges of all attack nodes with a transformer encoder, capturing interdependencies between attributes and edges more effectively than most existing graph injection attack methods that generate these elements sequentially. Additionally, MonTi adaptively allocates the degree budget for each attack node to explore diverse injection structures involving target, candidate, and attack nodes, unlike existing methods that fix the degree budget across all attack nodes. Experiments show that MonTi outperforms the state-of-the-art graph injection attack methods on five real-world graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, 12 tables, The 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025)</p></details> |

Recent advances in protein structure prediction and machine learning-driven molecule generation offer a promising opportunity to accelerate drug discovery. However, practical guidance on selecting and integrating these models into real-world pipelines remains limited. In this study, we develop an end-to-end, artificial intelligence-guided antibiotic discovery pipeline that spans target identification to compound realization. We leverage structure-based clustering across predicted proteomes of multiple pathogens to identify conserved, essential, and non-human-homologous targets. We then systematically evaluate six leading 3D-structure-aware generative models$\unicode{x2014}$spanning diffusion, autoregressive, graph neural network, and language model architectures$\unicode{x2014}$on their usability, chemical validity, and biological relevance. Rigorous post-processing filters and commercial analogue searches reduce over 100 000 generated compounds to a focused, synthesizable set. Our results highlight DeepBlock and TamGen as top performers across diverse criteria, while also revealing critical trade-offs between model complexity, usability, and output quality. This work provides a comparative benchmark and blueprint for deploying artificial intelligence in early-stage antibiotic development.</p></details> | 12 pages, preprint |

Towards recognizing social media recommender systems with missing recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11000v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media plays a crucial role in shaping society, often amplifying polarization and spreading misinformation. These effects stem from complex dynamics involving user interactions, individual traits, and recommender algorithms driving content selection. Recommender systems, which significantly shape the content users see and decisions they make, offer an opportunity for intervention and regulation. However, assessing their impact is challenging due to algorithmic opacity and limited data availability. To effectively model user decision-making, it is crucial to recognize the recommender system adopted by the platform. This work introduces a method for Automatic Recommender Recognition using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), based solely on network structure and observed behavior. To infer the hidden recommender, we first train a Recommender Neutral User model (RNU) using a GNN and an adapted hindsight academic network recommender, aiming to reduce reliance on the actual recommender in the data. We then generate several Recommender Hypothesis-specific Synthetic Datasets (RHSD) by combining the RNU with different known recommenders, producing ground truths for testing. Finally, we train Recommender Hypothesis-specific User models (RHU) under various hypotheses and compare each candidate with the original used to generate the RHSD. Our approach enables accurate detection of hidden recommenders and their influence on user behavior. Unlike audit-based methods, it captures system behavior directly, without ad hoc experiments that often fail to reflect real platforms. This study provides insights into how recommenders shape behavior, aiding efforts to reduce polarization and misinformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RLDM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Transfer Learning for Temporal Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10925v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction on graphs has applications spanning from recommender systems to drug discovery. Temporal link prediction (TLP) refers to predicting future links in a temporally evolving graph and adds additional complexity related to the dynamic nature of graphs. State-of-the-art TLP models incorporate memory modules alongside graph neural networks to learn both the temporal mechanisms of incoming nodes and the evolving graph topology. However, memory modules only store information about nodes seen at train time, and hence such models cannot be directly transferred to entirely new graphs at test time and deployment. In this work, we study a new transfer learning task for temporal link prediction, and develop transfer-effective methods for memory-laden models. Specifically, motivated by work showing the informativeness of structural signals for the TLP task, we augment a structural mapping module to the existing TLP model architectures, which learns a mapping from graph structural (topological) features to memory embeddings. Our work paves the way for a memory-free foundation model for TLP.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Towards A Universal Graph Structural Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10917v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large-scale pre-training have shown the potential to learn generalizable representations for downstream tasks. In the graph domain, however, capturing and transferring structural information across different graph domains remains challenging, primarily due to the inherent differences in topological patterns across various contexts. Additionally, most existing models struggle to capture the complexity of rich graph structures, leading to inadequate exploration of the embedding space. To address these challenges, we propose GFSE, a universal graph structural encoder designed to capture transferable structural patterns across diverse domains such as molecular graphs, social networks, and citation networks. GFSE is the first cross-domain graph structural encoder pre-trained with multiple self-supervised learning objectives. Built on a Graph Transformer, GFSE incorporates attention mechanisms informed by graph inductive bias, enabling it to encode intricate multi-level and fine-grained topological features. The pre-trained GFSE produces generic and theoretically expressive positional and structural encoding for graphs, which can be seamlessly integrated with various downstream graph feature encoders, including graph neural networks for vectorized features and Large Language Models for text-attributed graphs. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate GFSE's capability to significantly enhance the model's performance while requiring substantially less task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, GFSE achieves state-of-the-art performance in 81.6% evaluated cases, spanning diverse graph models and datasets, highlighting its potential as a powerful and versatile encoder for graph-structured data.</p></details> |  |

Existing GNN models focus on prediction accuracy, frequently overlooking fairness across different degree groups. To addressthis issue, we propose a novel GNN framework, namely Fairness- Aware Asymmetric Contrastive Ensemble (FairACE), which inte-grates asymmetric contrastive learning with adversarial training to improve degree fairness. FairACE captures one-hop local neighborhood information and two-hop monophily similarity to create fairer node representations and employs a degree fairness regulator to balance performance between high-degree and low-degree nodes. During model training, a novel group-balanced fairness loss is proposed to minimize classification disparities across degree groups. In addition, we also propose a novel fairness metric, the Accuracy Distribution Gap (ADG), which can quantitatively assess and ensure equitable performance across different degree-based node groups. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FairACE significantly improves degree fairness metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art GNN models.</p></details> |  |

Conventional computational methods for identifying such materials are resource-intensive and not easily scalable. Recently, universal interatomic potential models have been developed using equivariant graph neural networks. These models are trained on extensive datasets of first-principles force and energy calculations. One can achieve significant computational advantages by leveraging them as the foundation for traditional methods of assessing the ionic conductivity, such as molecular dynamics or nudged elastic band techniques. However, the generalization error from model inference on diverse atomic structures arising in such calculations can compromise the reliability of the results. In this work, we propose an approach for the quick and reliable screening of ionic conductors through the analysis of a universal interatomic potential. Our method incorporates a set of heuristic structure descriptors that effectively employ the rich knowledge of the underlying model while requiring minimal generalization capabilities. Using our descriptors, we rank lithium-containing materials in the Materials Project database according to their expected ionic conductivity. Eight out of the ten highest-ranked materials are confirmed to be superionic at room temperature in first-principles calculations. Notably, our method achieves a speed-up factor of approximately 50 compared to molecular dynamics driven by a machine-learning potential, and is at least 3,000 times faster compared to first-principles molecular dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Large...</summary><p>Larger-scale AIMD validation of our predictions; minor text updates.

These models facilitate the understanding of matter and the discovery of new molecules and materials. In contrast to GNNs operating on a large homogeneous graphs, GNNs used by CFMs process a large number of geometric graphs of varying sizes, requiring different optimization strategies than those developed for large homogeneous GNNs. This paper presents optimizations for two critical phases of CFM training: data distribution and model training, targeting MACE - a state-of-the-art CFM. We address the challenge of load balancing in data distribution by formulating it as a multi-objective bin packing problem. We propose an iterative algorithm that provides a highly effective, fast, and practical solution, ensuring efficient data distribution. For the training phase, we identify symmetric tensor contraction as the key computational kernel in MACE and optimize this kernel to improve the overall performance. Our combined approach of balanced data distribution and kernel optimization significantly enhances the training process of MACE. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial speedup, reducing per-epoch execution time for training from 12 to 2 minutes on 740 GPUs with a 2.6M sample dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 34th ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC 2025)</p></details> |

The success of these models can be attributed to their ability to effectively learn latent representations of atomic structures directly from the training data. Conversely, this also results in high data requirements for these models, hindering their application to problems which are data sparse which are common in this domain. To address this limitation, there is a growing development in the area of pre-trained machine learning models which have learned general, fundamental, geometric relationships in atomistic data, and which can then be fine-tuned to much smaller application-specific datasets. In particular, models which are pre-trained on diverse, large-scale atomistic datasets have shown impressive generalizability and flexibility to downstream applications, and are increasingly referred to as atomistic foundation models. To leverage the untapped potential of these foundation models, we introduce MatterTune, a modular and extensible framework that provides advanced fine-tuning capabilities and seamless integration of atomistic foundation models into downstream materials informatics and simulation workflows, thereby lowering the barriers to adoption and facilitating diverse applications in materials science. In its current state, MatterTune supports a number of state-of-the-art foundation models such as ORB, MatterSim, JMP, and EquformerV2, and hosts a wide range of features including a modular and flexible design, distributed and customizable fine-tuning, broad support for downstream informatics tasks, and more.</p></details> |  |
| **[Invariance Matters: Empowering Social Recommendation via Graph Invariant Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10432v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based social recommendation systems have shown significant promise in enhancing recommendation performance, particularly in addressing the issue of data sparsity in user behaviors. Typically, these systems leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture user preferences by incorporating high-order social influences from observed social networks. However, existing graph-based social recommendations often overlook the fact that social networks are inherently noisy, containing task-irrelevant relationships that can hinder accurate user preference learning. The removal of these redundant social relations is crucial, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth. In this paper, we approach the social denoising problem from the perspective of graph invariant learning and propose a novel method, Social Graph Invariant Learning(SGIL). Specifically,SGIL aims to uncover stable user preferences within the input social graph, thereby enhancing the robustness of graph-based social recommendation systems. To achieve this goal, SGIL first simulates multiple noisy social environments through graph generators. It then seeks to learn environment-invariant user preferences by minimizing invariant risk across these environments. To further promote diversity in the generated social environments, we employ an adversarial training strategy to simulate more potential social noisy distributions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SGIL. The code is available at https://github.com/yimutianyang/SIGIR2025-SGIL.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the effect of using different coarse-grained graph resolutions, obtained through the Laplacian renormalization group theory, on node classification tasks. At the theory's core is grouping nodes connected by significant information flow at a given time scale. Representations of the graph at different scales encode interaction information at different ranges. We specifically experiment using representations at the characteristic scale of the graph's mesoscopic structures. We provide the models with the original graph and the graph represented at the characteristic resolution scale and compare them to models that can only access the original graph. Our results showed that models with access to both the original graph and the characteristic scale graph can achieve statistically significant improvements in test accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While most research has centered on static graphs, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic, temporally evolving graphs, motivating the need for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph (CTDG) models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of Graph Representation Learning (GRL) on CTDGs with a focus on Self-Supervised Representation Learning (SSRL). We introduce a novel theoretical framework that analyzes the expressivity of CTDG models through an Information-Flow (IF) lens, quantifying their ability to propagate and encode temporal and structural information. Leveraging this framework, we categorize existing CTDG methods based on their suitability for different graph types and application scenarios. Within the same scope, we examine the design of SSRL methods tailored to CTDGs, such as predictive and contrastive approaches, highlighting their potential to mitigate the reliance on labeled data. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical insights, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of various methods across long-range, bi-partite and community-based graphs. This work offers both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for selecting and developing CTDG models, advancing the understanding of GRL in dynamic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR.

| **[Unleashing Expert Opinion from Social Media for Stock Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10078v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While stock prediction task traditionally relies on volume-price and fundamental data to predict the return ratio or price movement trend, sentiment factors derived from social media platforms such as StockTwits offer a complementary and useful source of real-time market information. However, we find that most social media posts, along with the public sentiment they reflect, provide limited value for trading predictions due to their noisy nature. To tackle this, we propose a novel dynamic expert tracing algorithm that filters out non-informative posts and identifies both true and inverse experts whose consistent predictions can serve as valuable trading signals. Our approach achieves significant improvements over existing expert identification methods in stock trend prediction. However, when using binary expert predictions to predict the return ratio, similar to all other expert identification methods, our approach faces a common challenge of signal sparsity with expert signals cover only about 4% of all stock-day combinations in our dataset. To address this challenge, we propose a dual graph attention neural network that effectively propagates expert signals across related stocks, enabling accurate prediction of return ratios and significantly increasing signal coverage. Empirical results show that our propagated expert-based signals not only exhibit strong predictive power independently but also work synergistically with traditional financial features. These combined signals significantly outperform representative baseline models in all quant-related metrics including predictive accuracy, return metrics, and correlation metrics, resulting in more robust investment strategies. We hope this work inspires further research into leveraging social media data for enhancing quantitative investment strategies.

However, the large data centres where cloud computing services are hosted consume significant amounts of electricity annually due to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) components.

| **[Towards Unbiased Federated Graph Learning: Label and Topology Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09963v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) enables privacy-preserving, distributed training of graph neural networks without sharing raw data. Among its approaches, subgraph-FL has become the dominant paradigm, with most work focused on improving overall node classification accuracy. However, these methods often overlook fairness due to the complexity of node features, labels, and graph structures. In particular, they perform poorly on nodes with disadvantaged properties, such as being in the minority class within subgraphs or having heterophilous connections (neighbors with dissimilar labels or misleading features). This reveals a critical issue: high accuracy can mask degraded performance on structurally or semantically marginalized nodes. To address this, we advocate for two fairness goals: (1) improving representation of minority class nodes for class-wise fairness and (2) mitigating topological bias from heterophilous connections for topology-aware fairness. We propose FairFGL, a novel framework that enhances fairness through fine-grained graph mining and collaborative learning. On the client side, the History-Preserving Module prevents overfitting to dominant local classes, while the Majority Alignment Module refines representations of heterophilous majority-class nodes. The Gradient Modification Module transfers minority-class knowledge from structurally favorable clients to improve fairness. On the server side, FairFGL uploads only the most influenced subset of parameters to reduce communication costs and better reflect local distributions. A cluster-based aggregation strategy reconciles conflicting updates and curbs global majority dominance . Extensive evaluations on eight benchmarks show FairFGL significantly improves minority-group performance , achieving up to a 22.62 percent Macro-F1 gain while enhancing convergence over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | Under Review |

The problem is framed as a constrained statistical learning task, where each network node operates using only local information. Opportunistic routing exploits the broadcast nature of wireless communication to dynamically select optimal forwarding nodes, enabling the information to reach the destination through multiple relay nodes simultaneously. To solve this, we propose a State-Augmentation (SA) based distributed optimization approach aimed at maximizing the total information handled by the source nodes in the network. The problem formulation leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which perform graph convolutions based on the topological connections between network nodes. Using an unsupervised learning paradigm, we extract routing policies from the GNN architecture, enabling optimal decisions for source nodes across various flows. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance when training a GNN-parameterized model, particularly when compared to baseline algorithms. Additionally, applying the method to real-world network topologies and wireless ad-hoc network test beds validates its effectiveness, highlighting the robustness and transferability of GNNs.</p></details> |  |

This variability necessitates the deployment of advanced computational methods to integrate and interpret these diverse datasets within a cohesive analytical framework. In our research, we amalgamate functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural MRI into a cohesive framework. This integration capitalizes on the unique strengths of each modality and their inherent interconnections, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the brain's connectivity and anatomical characteristics. Utilizing the Glasser atlas for parcellation, we integrate imaging derived features from various modalities: functional connectivity from fMRI, structural connectivity from DTI, and anatomical features from sMRI within consistent regions. Our approach incorporates a masking strategy to differentially weight neural connections, thereby facilitating a holistic amalgamation of multimodal imaging data. This technique enhances interpretability at connectivity level, transcending traditional analyses centered on singular regional attributes. The model is applied to the Human Connectome Project's Development study to elucidate the associations between multimodal imaging and cognitive functions throughout youth. The analysis demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and uncovers crucial anatomical features and essential neural connections, deepening our understanding of brain structure and function.</p></details> |  |

Identifying biomarkers for personalized treatment is crucial. While immune cells play a key role in IBD, accurately identifying ulcer regions in whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for characterizing these cells and exploring potential therapeutics. Multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches have advanced WSI analysis but they lack spatial context awareness. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised model called DomainGCN that employs a graph convolution neural network (GCN) and incorporates domain-specific knowledge of ulcer features, specifically, the presence of epithelium, lymphocytes, and debris for WSI-level ulcer prediction in IBD. We demonstrate that DomainGCN outperforms various state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods and show the added value of domain knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work accepted at ISBI 2025</p></details> |

Accurate modeling of fluoride-related health risks, such as dental fluorosis, requires spatially aware learning frameworks capable of capturing both geographic and semantic heterogeneity. In this work, we propose Spatially Directional Dual-Attention Graph Attention Network (SDD-GAT), a novel spatial graph neural network designed for fine-grained health risk prediction. SDD-GAT introduces a dual-graph architecture that disentangles geographic proximity and attribute similarity, and incorporates a directional attention mechanism that explicitly encodes spatial orientation and distance into the message passing process. To further enhance spatial coherence, we introduce a spatial smoothness regularization term that enforces consistency in predictions across neighboring locations. We evaluate SDD-GAT on a large-scale dataset covering over 50,000 fluoride monitoring samples and fluorosis records across Guizhou Province, China. Results show that SDD-GAT significantly outperforms traditional models and state-of-the-art GNNs in both regression and classification tasks, while also exhibiting improved spatial autocorrelation as measured by Moran's I. Our framework provides a generalizable foundation for spatial health risk modeling and geospatial learning under complex environmental settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Column Generation with Graph Neural Networks for Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03692v4)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing service schedules is pivotal to the reliable, efficient, and inclusive on-demand mobility. This pressing challenge is further exacerbated by the increasing needs of an aging population, the oversubscription of existing services, and the lack of effective solution methods. This study addresses the intricacies of service scheduling, by jointly optimizing rider trip planning and crew scheduling for a complex dynamic mobility service. The resulting optimization problems are extremely challenging computationally for state-of-the-art methods. To address this fundamental gap, this paper introduces the Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling Problem (JRTPCSSP) and a novel solution method, called Attention and Gated GNN-Informed Column Generation (AGGNNI-CG), that hybridizes column generation and machine learning to obtain near-optimal solutions to the JRTPCSSP with real-life constraints of the application. The key idea of the machine-learning component is to dramatically reduce the number of paths to explore in the pricing problem, accelerating the most time-consuming component of the column generation. The machine learning component is a graph neural network with an attention mechanism and a gated architecture, which is particularly suited to cater for the different input sizes coming from daily operations. AGGNNI-CG has been applied to a challenging, real-world dataset from the Paratransit system of Chatham County in Georgia. It produces substantial improvements compared to the baseline column generation approach, which typically cannot produce high-quality feasible solutions in reasonable time on large-scale complex instances. AGGNNI-CG also produces significant improvements in service quality compared to the existing system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Learning-Driven Multi-Vessel Association: Fusing Multimodal Data for Maritime Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09197v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring maritime safety and optimizing traffic management in increasingly crowded and complex waterways require effective waterway monitoring. However, current methods struggle with challenges arising from multimodal data, such as dimensional disparities, mismatched target counts, vessel scale variations, occlusions, and asynchronous data streams from systems like the automatic identification system (AIS) and closed-circuit television (CCTV). Traditional multi-target association methods often struggle with these complexities, particularly in densely trafficked waterways. To overcome these issues, we propose a graph learning-driven multi-vessel association (GMvA) method tailored for maritime multimodal data fusion. By integrating AIS and CCTV data, GMvA leverages time series learning and graph neural networks to capture the spatiotemporal features of vessel trajectories effectively. To enhance feature representation, the proposed method incorporates temporal graph attention and spatiotemporal attention, effectively capturing both local and global vessel interactions. Furthermore, a multi-layer perceptron-based uncertainty fusion module computes robust similarity scores, and the Hungarian algorithm is adopted to ensure globally consistent and accurate target matching. Extensive experiments on real-world maritime datasets confirm that GMvA delivers superior accuracy and robustness in multi-target association, outperforming existing methods even in challenging scenarios with high vessel density and incomplete or unevenly distributed AIS and CCTV data.</p></details> |  |

Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer an alternative by leveraging graph-based methodologies but are hindered by the computational bottlenecks of clustering algorithms used for edge generation. To address these issues, we propose the Hypergraph Vision Transformer (HgVT), which incorporates a hierarchical bipartite hypergraph structure into the vision transformer framework to capture higher-order semantic relationships while maintaining computational efficiency. HgVT leverages population and diversity regularization for dynamic hypergraph construction without clustering, and expert edge pooling to enhance semantic extraction and facilitate graph-based image retrieval. Empirical results demonstrate that HgVT achieves strong performance on image classification and retrieval, positioning it as an efficient framework for semantic-based vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Traditional GNNs follow a message passing scheme that can effectively utilize local and structural information. However, the phenomena of over-smoothing and over-squashing limit the receptive field in message passing processes. Graph Transformers were introduced to address these issues, achieving a global receptive field but suffering from the noise of irrelevant nodes and loss of structural information. Therefore, drawing inspiration from fine-grained token-based representation learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we propose the Structure-aware Multi-token Graph Transformer (Tokenphormer), which generates multiple tokens to effectively capture local and structural information and explore global information at different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first introduce the walk-token generated by mixed walks consisting of four walk types to explore the graph and capture structure and contextual information flexibly. To ensure local and global information coverage, we also introduce the SGPM-token (obtained through the Self-supervised Graph Pre-train Model, SGPM) and the hop-token, extending the length and density limit of the walk-token, respectively. Finally, these expressive tokens are fed into the Transformer model to learn node representations collaboratively. Experimental results demonstrate that the capability of the proposed Tokenphormer can achieve state-of-the-art performance on node classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Addressing Graph Heterogeneity and Heterophily from A Spectral Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13373v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated excellent performance in semi-supervised node classification tasks. Despite this, two primary challenges persist: heterogeneity and heterophily. Each of these two challenges can significantly hinder the performance of GNNs. Heterogeneity refers to a graph with multiple types of nodes or edges, while heterophily refers to the fact that connected nodes are more likely to have dissimilar attributes or labels. Although there have been few works studying heterogeneous heterophilic graphs, they either only consider the heterophily of specific meta-paths and lack expressiveness, or have high expressiveness but fail to exploit high-order neighbors. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Heterophilic Spectral Graph Neural Network (H2SGNN), which employs two modules: local independent filtering and global hybrid filtering. Local independent filtering adaptively learns node representations under different homophily, while global hybrid filtering exploits high-order neighbors to learn more possible meta-paths. Extensive experiments are conducted on four datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed H2SGNN, which achieves superior performance with fewer parameters and memory consumption. The code is available at the GitHub repo: https://github.com/Lukangkang123/H2SGNN/.</p></details> |  |

However, most HGP methods suffer not only from lack of considering global topology of the graph and focusing on the feature learning aspect, but also they do not align local and global features since graphs should inherently be analyzed in a multiscale way. LGRPool is proposed in the present paper as a HGP in the framework of expectation maximization in machine learning that aligns local and global aspects of message passing with each other using a regularizer to force the global topological information to be inline with the local message passing at different scales through the representations at different layers of HGP. Experimental results on some graph classification benchmarks show that it slightly outperforms some baselines.</p></details> | f tables, 2 figures |

It reduces the number of decision variables in a problem by solving a pricing problem. For many CO problems, the pricing problem is an Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (ESPPRC). Large ESPPRC instances are difficult to solve to near-optimality. Consequently, we use a Graph neural Network (GNN) to reduces the size of the ESPPRC such that it becomes computationally tractable with standard solving techniques. Our GNN is trained by Unsupervised Learning and outputs a distribution for the arcs to be retained in the reduced PP. The reduced PP is solved by a local search that finds columns with large reduced costs and speeds up convergence. We apply our method on a set of Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows and show significant improvements in convergence compared to simple reduction techniques from the literature. For a fixed computational budget, we improve the objective values by over 9\% for larger instances. We also analyze the performance of our CG algorithm and test the generalization of our method to different classes of instances than the training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Existing solutions for the design space exploration (DSE) adopt either heuristic methods, lacking essential information for further optimization potential, or predictive models, missing sufficient generalization due to the time-consuming nature of HLS and the exponential growth of the design space. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Inverse Design for HLS (DID4HLS), a novel approach that integrates graph neural networks and generative models. DID4HLS iteratively optimizes hardware designs aimed at compute-intensive algorithms by learning conditional distributions of design features from post-HLS data. Compared to four state-of-the-art DSE baselines, our method achieved an average improvement of 42.8% on average distance to reference set (ADRS) compared to the best-performing baselines across six benchmarks, while demonstrating high robustness and efficiency.

Traditional path-planning algorithms struggle in these scenarios, particularly when prior information is not available. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and transformer-based mechanisms for enhanced multi-agent coordination and collective task execution. Our approach leverages GNNs to model agent-agent and agent-goal interactions through adaptive graph construction, enabling efficient information aggregation and decision-making under constrained communication. A transformer-based message-passing mechanism, augmented with edge-feature-enhanced attention, captures complex interaction patterns, while a Double Deep Q-Network (Double DQN) with prioritized experience replay optimizes agent policies in partially observable environments. This integration is carefully designed to address specific requirements of multi-agent navigation, such as scalability, adaptability, and efficient task execution. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance, with 90% service provisioning and 100% grid coverage (node discovery), while reducing the average steps per episode to 200, compared to 600 for benchmark methods such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), greedy algorithms and DQN.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, Accepted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)</p></details> |

Unlike traditional machine learning methods that rely solely on numerical features of transaction records, this approach constructs heterogeneous transaction graphs. These graphs incorporate multiple node types, including users, merchants, and transactions. By leveraging graph neural networks, the model captures higher-order transaction relationships. A Graph Attention Mechanism is employed to dynamically assign weights to different transaction relationships. Additionally, a Temporal Decay Mechanism is integrated to enhance the model's sensitivity to time-related fraud patterns. To address the scarcity of fraudulent transaction samples, this study applies SMOTE oversampling and Cost-sensitive Learning. These techniques strengthen the model's ability to identify fraudulent transactions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing GNN models, including GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE, on the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset. The model achieves notable improvements in both accuracy and OC-ROC. Future research may explore the integration of dynamic graph neural networks and reinforcement learning.

There is a significant amount of research that suggests that social media are highly polarized. A phenomenon that is commonly observed is the echo chamber structure, where users are organized in polarized communities and form connections only with similar-minded individuals, limiting themselves to consume specific content. In this paper we explore a way to decrease the polarization of networks with two echo chambers. Particularly, we observe that if some users adopt a moderate opinion about a topic, the polarization of the network decreases. Based on this observation, we propose an efficient algorithm to identify a good set of K users, such that if they adopt a moderate stance around a topic, the polarization is minimized. Our algorithm employs a Graph Neural Network and thus it can handle large graphs more effectively than other approaches</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) represent the state-of-the-art approach for modeling atomistic material data thanks to their capacity to capture complex relational structures. While machine learning performance has historically improved with larger models and datasets, GNNs for atomistic materials modeling remain relatively small compared to large language models (LLMs), which leverage billions of parameters and terabyte-scale datasets to achieve remarkable performance in their respective domains. To address this gap, we explore the scaling limits of GNNs for atomistic materials modeling by developing a foundational model with billions of parameters, trained on extensive datasets in terabyte-scale. Our approach incorporates techniques from LLM libraries to efficiently manage large-scale data and models, enabling both effective training and deployment of these large-scale GNN models. This work addresses three fundamental questions in scaling GNNs: the potential for scaling GNN model architectures, the effect of dataset size on model accuracy, and the applicability of LLM-inspired techniques to GNN architectures. Specifically, the outcomes of this study include (1) insights into the scaling laws for GNNs, highlighting the relationship between model size, dataset volume, and accuracy, (2) a foundational GNN model optimized for atomistic materials modeling, and (3) a GNN codebase enhanced with advanced LLM-based training techniques.

Essential to this endeavour are anatomical 3D surface and volumetric meshes derived from CMR images, which facilitate computational anatomy studies, biomarker discovery, and in-silico simulations. Traditional approaches typically follow complex multi-step pipelines, first segmenting images and then reconstructing meshes, making them time-consuming and prone to error propagation. In response, we introduce HybridVNet, a novel architecture for direct image-to-mesh extraction seamlessly integrating standard convolutional neural networks with graph convolutions, which we prove can efficiently handle surface and volumetric meshes by encoding them as graph structures. To further enhance accuracy, we propose a multi-view HybridVNet architecture which processes both long axis and short axis CMR, showing that it can increase the performance of cardiac MR mesh generation. Our model combines traditional convolutional networks with variational graph generative models, deep supervision and mesh-specific regularisation. Experiments on a comprehensive dataset from the UK Biobank confirm the potential of HybridVNet to significantly advance cardiac imaging and computational cardiology by efficiently generating high-fidelity meshes from CMR images. Multi-view HybridVNet outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements of up to $\sim$27\% reduction in Mean Contour Distance (from 1.86 mm to 1.35 mm for the LV Myocardium), up to $\sim$18\% improvement in Hausdorff distance (from 4.74 mm to 3.89mm, for the LV Endocardium), and up to $\sim$8\% in Dice Coefficient (from 0.78 to 0.84, for the LV Myocardium), highlighting its superior accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in spatial feature extraction, they often neglect inter-image relational dependencies, leading to misclassifications. This paper proposes an interpretable hybrid Sequential CNN-Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that synergizes MobileNetV2 for localized feature extraction and GraphSAGE for relational modeling. The framework constructs a graph where nodes represent leaf images, with edges defined by cosine similarity-based adjacency matrices and adaptive neighborhood sampling. This design captures fine-grained lesion features and global symptom patterns, addressing inter-class similarity challenges. Cross-modal interpretability is achieved via Grad-CAM and Eigen-CAM visualizations, generating heatmaps to highlight disease-influential regions. Evaluated on a dataset of ten soybean leaf diseases, the model achieves $97.16\%$ accuracy, surpassing standalone CNNs ($\le95.04\%$) and traditional machine learning models ($\le77.05\%$). Ablation studies validate the sequential architecture's superiority over parallel or single-model configurations. With only 2.3 million parameters, the lightweight MobileNetV2-GraphSAGE combination ensures computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. The proposed approach bridges the gap between accurate classification and practical applicability, offering a robust, interpretable tool for agricultural diagnostics while advancing CNN-GNN integration in plant pathology research.</p></details> |  |

Traditional machine learning models remain effective in resource-limited environments due to their efficiency, requiring fewer parameters and less computational time. However, handling short and highly imbalanced datasets remains challenging. In this study, we propose the fusion of a Contrastive Attentive Graph Network and Graph Attention Network (CAGN-GAT Fusion) and benchmark it against 15 other models, including both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and traditional ML models. Our evaluation is conducted on four benchmark datasets (KDD-CUP-1999, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017) using a short and proportionally imbalanced dataset with a constant size of 5000 samples to ensure fairness in comparison. Results show that CAGN-GAT Fusion demonstrates stable and competitive accuracy, recall, and F1-score, even though it does not achieve the highest performance in every dataset. Our analysis also highlights the impact of adaptive graph construction techniques, including small changes in connections (edge perturbation) and selective hiding of features (feature masking), improving detection performance. The findings confirm that GNNs, particularly CAGN-GAT Fusion, are robust and computationally efficient, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments. Future work will explore GraphSAGE layers and multiview graph construction techniques to further enhance adaptability and detection accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 38th International Conference on Industrial, Engineering & Other Applications of Applied Intelligent Systems (IEA/AIE 2025), Kitakyushu, Japan, Jul 2025</p></details> |

In addition, suitable invariant input and output spaces are derived that allow the GNN models to be embedded seamlessly into the LES framework to obtain a symmetry-preserving simulation setup. The suitability of the proposed approach is investigated for two canonical test cases: Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (HIT) and turbulent channel flow. For both cases, GNN models are trained successfully in actual simulations using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to ensure that the models are consistent with the underlying LES formulation and discretization. It is demonstrated for the HIT case that the resulting GNN-based LES scheme recovers rotational and reflectional equivariance up to machine precision in actual simulations. At the same time, the stability and accuracy remain on par with non-symmetry-preserving machine learning models that fail to obey these properties. The same modeling strategy translates well to turbulent channel flow, where the GNN model successfully learns the more complex flow physics and is able to recover the turbulent statistics and Reynolds stresses. It is shown that the GNN model learns a zonal modeling strategy with distinct behaviors in the near-wall and outer regions. The proposed approach thus demonstrates the potential of GNNs for turbulence modeling, especially in the context of LES and RL.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

One of the most effective techniques to detect OOD nodes is to expose the detector model with an additional OOD node-set, yet the extra OOD instances are often difficult to obtain in practice. Recent methods for image data address this problem using OOD data synthesis, typically relying on pre-trained generative models like Stable Diffusion. However, these approaches require vast amounts of additional data, as well as one-for-all pre-trained generative models, which are not available for graph data. Therefore, we propose the GOLD framework for graph OOD detection, an implicit adversarial learning pipeline with synthetic OOD exposure without pre-trained models. The implicit adversarial training process employs a novel alternating optimisation framework by training: (1) a latent generative model to regularly imitate the in-distribution (ID) embeddings from an evolving GNN, and (2) a GNN encoder and an OOD detector to accurately classify ID data while increasing the energy divergence between the ID embeddings and the generative model's synthetic embeddings. This novel approach implicitly transforms the synthetic embeddings into pseudo-OOD instances relative to the ID data, effectively simulating exposure to OOD scenarios without auxiliary data. Extensive OOD detection experiments are conducted on five benchmark graph datasets, verifying the superior performance of GOLD without using real OOD data compared with the state-of-the-art OOD exposure and non-exposure baselines.</p></details> | ICLR25 |
| **[Prediction of Usage Probabilities of Shopping-Mall Corridors Using Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07645v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method based on graph neural network (GNN) for prediction of probabilities of usage of shopping-mall corridors. The heterogeneous graph network of shops and corridor paths are obtained from floorplans of the malls by creating vector layers for corridors, shops and entrances. These are subsequently assimilated into nodes and edges of graphs. The prediction of the usage probability is based on the shop features, namely, the area and usage categories they fall into, and on the graph connecting these shops, corridor junctions and entrances by corridor paths. Though the presented method is applicable for training on datasets obtained from a field survey or from pedestrian-detecting sensors, the target data of the supervised deep-learning work flow in this work are obtained from a probability method. We also include a context-specific representation learning of latent features. The usage-probability prediction is made on each edge, which is a connection by a section of corridor path between the adjacent nodes representing the shops or corridor points. To create a feature for each edge, the hidden-layer feature vectors acquired in the message-passing GNN layers at the nodes of each edge are averaged and concatenated with the vector obtained by their multiplication. These edge-features are then passed to multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to make the final prediction of usage probability on each edge. The samples of synthetic learning dataset for each shopping mall are obtained by changing the shops' usage and area categories, and by subsequently feeding the graph into the probability model. When including different shopping malls in a single dataset, we also propose to consider graph-level features to inform the model with specific identifying features of each mall.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, working manuscript with partial results</p></details> |

Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets and established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with respect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most comprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the honey bee (Apis mellifera), an ecologically vital pollinator. We evaluate ApisTox using a diverse suite of machine learning approaches, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as well as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical space. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as ApisTox, demonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art algorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for more diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the agrochemical domain.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based methods have made significant progress in the field of Android malware detection. However, traditional detection methods based on static features struggle to identify obfuscated malicious code, while methods relying on dynamic analysis suffer from low efficiency. To address this, we propose a dynamic weighted feature selection method that analyzes the importance and stability of features, calculates scores to filter out the most robust features, and combines these selected features with the program's structural information. We then utilize graph neural networks for classification, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of the detection system. We analyzed 8,664 malware samples from eight malware families and tested a total of 44,940 malware variants generated using seven obfuscation strategies. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves an F1-score of 95.56% on the unobfuscated dataset and 92.28% on the obfuscated dataset, indicating that the model can effectively detect obfuscated malware.</p></details> | 15 pages, 1 figure |

A core desideratum is that explanations are \textit{faithful}, \ie that they portray an accurate picture of the GNN's reasoning process. However, a number of different faithfulness metrics exist, begging the question of what is faithfulness exactly and how to achieve it. We make three key contributions. We begin by showing that \textit{existing metrics are not interchangeable} -- \ie explanations attaining high faithfulness according to one metric may be unfaithful according to others -- and can systematically ignore important properties of explanations. We proceed to show that, surprisingly, \textit{optimizing for faithfulness is not always a sensible design goal}. Specifically, we prove that for injective regular GNN architectures, perfectly faithful explanations are completely uninformative. This does not apply to modular GNNs, such as self-explainable and domain-invariant architectures, prompting us to study the relationship between architectural choices and faithfulness. Finally, we show that \textit{faithfulness is tightly linked to out-of-distribution generalization}, in that simply ensuring that a GNN can correctly recognize the domain-invariant subgraph, as prescribed by the literature, does not guarantee that it is invariant unless this subgraph is also faithful.The code is publicly available on GitHub</p></details> | <details><summary>Uploa...</summary><p>Uploading ICLR25 camera ready version</p></details> |
| **[Towards Scalable and Deep Graph Neural Networks via Noise Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14602v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in many graph mining tasks. However, scaling them to large graphs is challenging due to the high computational and storage costs of repeated feature propagation and non-linear transformation during training. One commonly employed approach to address this challenge is model-simplification, which only executes the Propagation (P) once in the pre-processing, and Combine (C) these receptive fields in different ways and then feed them into a simple model for better performance. Despite their high predictive performance and scalability, these methods still face two limitations. First, existing approaches mainly focus on exploring different C methods from the model perspective, neglecting the crucial problem of performance degradation with increasing P depth from the data-centric perspective, known as the over-smoothing problem. Second, pre-processing overhead takes up most of the end-to-end processing time, especially for large-scale graphs. To address these limitations, we present random walk with noise masking (RMask), a plug-and-play module compatible with the existing model-simplification works. This module enables the exploration of deeper GNNs while preserving their scalability. Unlike the previous model-simplification works, we focus on continuous P and found that the noise existing inside each P is the cause of the over-smoothing issue, and use the efficient masking mechanism to eliminate them. Experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that model-simplification works equipped with RMask yield superior performance compared to their original version and can make a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, incorporating long histories is resource-intensive. Hence, temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) often rely on historical neighbors sampling heuristics such as uniform sampling or recent neighbors selection. These heuristics are static and fail to adapt to the underlying graph structure. We introduce FLASH, a learnable and graph-adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that generalizes existing heuristics. FLASH integrates seamlessly into TGNNs and is trained end-to-end using a self-supervised ranking loss. We provide theoretical evidence that commonly used heuristics hinders TGNNs performance, motivating our design. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent and significant performance improvements for TGNNs equipped with FLASH.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). Where previous works relied on semi-local functionals or fixed-size descriptors of the density, we compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud for efficient non-local atomic-range interactions. By applying an equivariant GNN on this point cloud, we capture molecular-range interactions in a scalable and accurate manner. To train EG-XC, we differentiate through a self-consistent field solver requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Representation Learning, 2025</p></details> |

Surrogate models offer a viable solution to reduce this overhead, but they are untested in real-world aerodynamic datasets. We present a comparative evaluation of two surrogate modeling approaches for predicting drag on a real-world dataset: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that uses a signed distance field as input and a commercial tool based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that directly processes a surface mesh. In contrast to previous studies based on datasets created from parameterized geometries, our dataset comprises 343 geometries derived from 32 baseline vehicle geometries across five distinct car projects, reflecting the diverse, free-form modifications encountered in the typical vehicle development process. Our results show that the CNN-based method achieves a mean absolute error of 2.3 drag counts, while the GNN-based method achieves 3.8. Both methods achieve approximately 77% accuracy in predicting the direction of drag change relative to the baseline geometry. While both methods effectively capture the broader trends between baseline groups (set of samples derived from a single baseline geometry), they struggle to varying extents in capturing the finer intra-baseline group variations. In summary, our findings suggest that aerodynamicists can effectively use both methods to predict drag in under two minutes, which is at least 600 times faster than performing a simulation. However, there remains room for improvement in capturing the finer details of the geometry.</p></details> |  |

The deep learning network for this task relies on historical data inputs, yet real-time data can be corrupted by sensor noise, altering its distribution. We model this noise as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise and incorporate it into the LargeST traffic volume dataset, resulting in data with both inherent and additive noise components. Our approach involves decomposing the corrupted signal into modes using variational mode decomposition, followed by feeding the data into a learning pipeline for prediction. We integrate a 3D attention mechanism encompassing spatial, temporal, and channel attention. The spatial and temporal attention modules learn their respective correlations, while the channel attention mechanism is used to suppress noise and highlight the significant modes in the spatiotemporal signals. Additionally, a learnable soft thresholding method is implemented to exclude unimportant modes from the feature vector, and a feature reduction method based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is applied. We compare the performance of our approach against baseline models, demonstrating that our method achieves superior long-term prediction accuracy, robustness to noise, and improved performance with mode truncation compared to the baseline models.

However, recent studies reveal that GNNs often fail to outperform simple MLPs on heterophilous graph tasks, where connected nodes may differ in features or labels, challenging the homophily assumption. Existing methods addressing this issue often overlook the importance of information granularity and rarely consider implicit relationships between distant nodes. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Granular and Implicit Graph Network (GRAIN), a novel GNN model specifically designed for heterophilous graphs. GRAIN enhances node embeddings by aggregating multi-view information at various granularity levels and incorporating implicit data from distant, non-neighboring nodes. This approach effectively integrates local and global information, resulting in smoother, more accurate node representations. We also introduce an adaptive graph information aggregator that efficiently combines multi-granularity and implicit data, significantly improving node representation quality, as shown by experiments on 13 datasets covering varying homophily and heterophily. GRAIN consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art models, excelling on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing attempts of heterophilous GNNs incorporate long-range or global aggregations to distinguish nodes in the graph. However, these aggregations usually require iteratively maintaining and updating full-graph information, which limits their efficiency when applying to large-scale graphs. In this paper, we propose SIGMA, an efficient global heterophilous GNN aggregation integrating the structural similarity measurement SimRank. Our theoretical analysis illustrates that SIGMA inherently captures distant global similarity even under heterophily, that conventional approaches can only achieve after iterative aggregations. Furthermore, it enjoys efficient one-time computation with a complexity only linear to the node set size $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SIGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior aggregation and overall efficiency. Notably, it obtains $5\times$ acceleration on the large-scale heterophily dataset pokec with over 30 million edges compared to the best baseline aggregation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Acceptted to ICDE 2025</p></details> |

In particular, we are interested in learning distributed optimal controllers using graph recurrent neural networks (GRNNs). Most of the existing approaches result in centralized optimal controllers with offline training processes. However, as the increasing demand of network resilience, the optimal controllers are further expected to be distributed, and are desirable to be trained in an online distributed fashion, which are also the main contributions of our work. To solve this problem, we first propose a GRNN-based distributed optimal control method, and we cast the problem as a self-supervised learning problem. Then, the distributed online training is achieved via distributed gradient computation, and inspired by the (consensus-based) distributed optimization idea, a distributed online training optimizer is designed. Furthermore, the local closed-loop stability of the linear networked system under our proposed GRNN-based controller is provided by assuming that the nonlinear activation function of the GRNN-based controller is both local sector-bounded and slope-restricted. The effectiveness of our proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations using a specifically developed simulator.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

Existing methods like low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are efficient but lack flexibility, while Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enhance model capacity at the cost of more & under-utilized parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Structural Mixture of Residual Experts (S'MoRE), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the efficiency of LoRA with the flexibility of MoE. Specifically, S'MoRE employs hierarchical low-rank decomposition of expert weights, yielding residuals of varying orders interconnected in a multi-layer structure. By routing input tokens through sub-trees of residuals, S'MoRE emulates the capacity of many experts by instantiating and assembling just a few low-rank matrices. We craft the inter-layer propagation of S'MoRE's residuals as a special type of Graph Neural Network (GNN), and prove that under similar parameter budget, S'MoRE improves "structural flexibility" of traditional MoE (or Mixture-of-LoRA) by exponential order. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that S'MoRE achieves superior fine-tuning performance, offering a transformative approach for efficient LLM adaptation.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |

Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.</p></details> |  |

Traditional metaheuristics excel at exploring complex solution spaces efficiently, yet they often struggle with scalability. Deep learning has become a viable alternative for quickly generating high-quality solutions, particularly when metaheuristics underperform. In recent years, quantum-inspired approaches such as tensor networks have shown promise in addressing these challenges. Despite these advancements, a thorough comparison of the different paradigms is missing. This study evaluates eight algorithms on Weighted Max-Cut graphs ranging from 10 to 250 nodes. Specifically, we compare a Genetic Algorithm representing metaheuristics, a Graph Neural Network for deep learning, and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group as a tensor network approach. Our analysis focuses on solution quality and computational efficiency (i.e., time and memory usage). Numerical results show that the Genetic Algorithm achieves near-optimal results for small graphs, although its computation time grows significantly with problem size. The Graph Neural Network offers a balanced solution for medium-sized instances with low memory demands and rapid inference, yet it exhibits more significant variability on larger graphs. Meanwhile, the Tensor Network approach consistently yields high approximation ratios and efficient execution on larger graphs, albeit with increased memory consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, paper Submitted to GECCO '25</p></details> |

However, traditional caching strategies such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU fail to effectively predict future content popularity, while existing proactive caching approaches often require users to upload data to a central server, raising concerns regarding privacy and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph Federated Learning-based Proactive Content Caching (GFPCC) scheme that enhances caching efficiency while preserving user privacy. The proposed approach integrates federated learning and graph neural networks, enabling users to locally train Light Graph Convolutional Networks (LightGCN) to capture user-item relationships and predict content popularity. Instead of sharing raw data, only the trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server, where a federated averaging algorithm aggregates updates, refines the global model, and selects the most popular files for proactive caching. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, such as MovieLens, demonstrate that GFPCC outperforms baseline caching algorithms by achieving higher cache efficiency through more accurate content popularity predictions. Moreover, the federated learning framework strengthens privacy protection while maintaining efficient model training; however, scalability remains a challenge in large-scale networks with dynamic user preferences.</p></details> |  |

In particular, our approach combines LiDAR-based 3D object detection with multi-view RGB references to ensure interpretable and reliable scene understanding. Uncertainty and risk assessment, along with object interactions, are modelled using Bayesian Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs) for probabilistic reasoning under ambiguous conditions. Interpretable decisions are facilitated through CoT reasoning, leveraging object dynamics and contextual cues, while Grad-CAM visualizations highlight attention regions.

However, recent empirical evidence suggests the notion of separation itself doesn't capture several interesting phenomena. On the one hand, the quality of this separation may be very weak, to the extent that the embeddings of "separable" objects might even be considered identical when using fixed finite precision. On the other hand, architectures which aren't capable of separation in theory, somehow achieve separation when taking the network to be wide enough. In this work, we address both of these issues, by proposing a novel pair-wise separation quality analysis framework which is based on an adaptation of Lipschitz and \Holder{} stability to parametric functions. The proposed framework, which we name \emph{\Holder{} in expectation}, allows for separation quality analysis, without restricting the analysis to embeddings that can separate all the input space simultaneously. We prove that common sum-based models are lower-\Holder{} in expectation, with an exponent that decays rapidly with the network's depth . Our analysis leads to adversarial examples of graphs which can be separated by three 1-WL iterations, but cannot be separated in practice by standard maximally powerful Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). To remedy this, we propose two novel MPNNs with improved separation quality, one of which is lower Lipschitz in expectation. We show these MPNNs can easily classify our adversarial examples, and compare favorably with standard MPNNs on standard graph learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results by modeling molecules as molecular graphs, their reliance on data-driven learning limits their ability to generalize, particularly in the presence of data imbalance and diverse molecular substructures. Existing methods often overlook the varying contributions of different substructures to molecular properties, treating them uniformly. To address these challenges, we propose ASE-Mol, a novel GNN-based framework that leverages a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for molecular property prediction. ASE-Mol incorporates BRICS decomposition and significant substructure awareness to dynamically identify positive and negative substructures. By integrating a MoE architecture, it reduces the adverse impact of negative motifs while improving adaptability to positive motifs. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASE-Mol achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in both accuracy and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural networks excel at learning graph data, the omnipresent non-Euclidean structure, but often lack the generalization capacity. Hence, graph foundation model is drawing increasing attention, and recent efforts have been made to leverage Large Language Models. On the one hand, existing studies primarily focus on text-attributed graphs, while a wider range of real graphs do not contain fruitful textual attributes. On the other hand, the sequential graph description tailored for the Large Language Model neglects the structural complexity, which is a predominant characteristic of the graph. Such limitations motivate an important question: Can we go beyond Large Language Models, and pretrain a universal model to learn the structural knowledge for any graph? The answer in the language or vision domain is a shared vocabulary. We observe the fact that there also exist shared substructures underlying graph domain, and thereby open a new opportunity of graph foundation model with structural vocabulary. The key innovation is the discovery of a simple yet effective structural vocabulary of trees and cycles, and we explore its inherent connection to Riemannian geometry. Herein, we present a universal pretraining model, RiemannGFM. Concretely, we first construct a novel product bundle to incorporate the diverse geometries of the vocabulary. Then, on this constructed space, we stack Riemannian layers where the structural vocabulary, regardless of specific graph, is learned in Riemannian manifold offering cross-domain transferability. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of RiemannGFM on a diversity of real graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |

Ensemble prediction systems provide probabilistic forecasts but exhibit biases and difficulties in capturing extreme weather. While post-processing techniques aim to enhance forecast accuracy, they rarely focus on precipitation, which exhibits complex spatial dependencies and tail behavior. Our novel framework leverages graph neural networks to post-process ensemble forecasts, specifically modeling the extremes of the underlying distribution. This allows to capture spatial dependencies and improves forecast accuracy for extreme events, thus leading to more reliable forecasts and mitigating risks of extreme precipitation and flooding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at ICLR 2025 - Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Workshop (https://www.climatechange.ai/events/iclr2025)</p></details> |
| **[GraphPINE: Graph Importance Propagation for Interpretable Drug Response Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05454v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainability is necessary for many tasks in biomedical research. Recent explainability methods have focused on attention, gradient, and Shapley value. These do not handle data with strong associated prior knowledge and fail to constrain explainability results based on known relationships between predictive features. We propose GraphPINE, a graph neural network (GNN) architecture leveraging domain-specific prior knowledge to initialize node importance optimized during training for drug response prediction. Typically, a manual post-prediction step examines literature (i.e., prior knowledge) to understand returned predictive features. While node importance can be obtained for gradient and attention after prediction, node importance from these methods lacks complementary prior knowledge; GraphPINE seeks to overcome this limitation. GraphPINE differs from other GNN gating methods by utilizing an LSTM-like sequential format. We introduce an importance propagation layer that unifies 1) updates for feature matrix and node importance and 2) uses GNN-based graph propagation of feature values. This initialization and updating mechanism allows for informed feature learning and improved graph representation. We apply GraphPINE to cancer drug response prediction using drug screening and gene data collected for over 5,000 gene nodes included in a gene-gene graph with a drug-target interaction (DTI) graph for initial importance. The gene-gene graph and DTIs were obtained from curated sources and weighted by article count discussing relationships between drugs and genes. GraphPINE achieves a PR-AUC of 0.894 and ROC-AUC of 0.796 across 952 drugs. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GraphPINE-40DE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe Automated Refactoring for Efficient Migration of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support responsiveness w.r.t. ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations to make code amenable to safe, accurate, and efficient graph execution. We present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in specifying whether their otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL code could be reliably and efficiently executed as graphs while preserving semantics. The approach, based on a novel imperative tensor analysis, automatically determines when it is safe and potentially advantageous to migrate imperative DL code to graph execution. The approach is implemented as a PyDev Eclipse IDE plug-in that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and evaluated on 19 Python projects consisting of 132.05 KLOC. We found that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Approach to Linking Histology Images with DNA Methylation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05403v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression by adding methyl groups to DNA. Abnormal methylation patterns can disrupt gene expression and have been linked to cancer development. To quantify DNA methylation, specialized assays are typically used. However, these assays are often costly and have lengthy processing times, which limits their widespread availability in routine clinical practice. In contrast, whole slide images (WSIs) for the majority of cancer patients can be more readily available. As such, given the ready availability of WSIs, there is a compelling need to explore the potential relationship between WSIs and DNA methylation patterns. To address this, we propose an end-to-end graph neural network based weakly supervised learning framework to predict the methylation state of gene groups exhibiting coherent patterns across samples. Using data from three cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - TCGA-LGG (Brain Lower Grade Glioma), TCGA-GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) ($n$=729) and TCGA-KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma) ($n$=511) - we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher AUROC scores than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, by more than $20\%$. We conduct gene set enrichment analyses on the gene groups and show that majority of the gene groups are significantly enriched in important hallmarks and pathways. We also generate spatially enriched heatmaps to further investigate links between histological patterns and DNA methylation states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores association of spatially resolved histological patterns with gene group methylation states across multiple cancer types using weakly supervised deep learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Coarse-Grained Dynamics on Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09324v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a Graph Neural Network (GNN) non-Markovian modeling framework to identify coarse-grained dynamical systems on graphs. Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.</p></details> | 43 pages, 12 figures |

Traditional compartmental models often struggle to estimate temporally and spatially varying epidemiological parameters, while deep learning models typically overlook disease transmission dynamics and lack interpretability in the epidemiological context. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Causal Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (CSTGNN), a hybrid framework that integrates a Spatio-Contact SIR model with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of epidemics. Inter-regional human mobility exhibits continuous and smooth spatiotemporal patterns, leading to adjacent graph structures that share underlying mobility dynamics. To model these dynamics, we employ an adaptive static connectivity graph to represent the stable components of human mobility and utilize a temporal dynamics model to capture fluctuations within these patterns. By integrating the adaptive static connectivity graph with the temporal dynamics graph, we construct a dynamic graph that encapsulates the comprehensive properties of human mobility networks. Additionally, to capture temporal trends and variations in infectious disease spread, we introduce a temporal decomposition model to handle temporal dependence. This model is then integrated with a dynamic graph convolutional network for epidemic forecasting. We validate our model using real-world datasets at the provincial level in China and the state level in Germany. Extensive studies demonstrate that our method effectively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases, providing a valuable tool for forecasting and intervention strategies. Furthermore, analysis of the learned parameters offers insights into disease transmission mechanisms, enhancing the interpretability and practical applicability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 12 figures.

| **[AsyReC: A Multimodal Graph-based Framework for Spatio-Temporal Asymmetric Dyadic Relationship Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05030v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dyadic social relationships, which refer to relationships between two individuals who know each other through repeated interactions (or not), are shaped by shared spatial and temporal experiences. Current computational methods for modeling these relationships face three major challenges: (1) the failure to model asymmetric relationships, e.g., one individual may perceive the other as a friend while the other perceives them as an acquaintance, (2) the disruption of continuous interactions by discrete frame sampling, which segments the temporal continuity of interaction in real-world scenarios, and (3) the limitation to consider periodic behavioral cues, such as rhythmic vocalizations or recurrent gestures, which are crucial for inferring the evolution of dyadic relationships. To address these challenges, we propose AsyReC, a multimodal graph-based framework for asymmetric dyadic relationship classification, with three core innovations: (i) a triplet graph neural network with node-edge dual attention that dynamically weights multimodal cues to capture interaction asymmetries (addressing challenge 1); (ii) a clip-level relationship learning architecture that preserves temporal continuity, enabling fine-grained modeling of real-world interaction dynamics (addressing challenge 2); and (iii) a periodic temporal encoder that projects time indices onto sine/cosine waveforms to model recurrent behavioral patterns (addressing challenge 3). Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, while ablation studies validate the critical role of asymmetric interaction modeling and periodic temporal encoding in improving the robustness of dyadic relationship classification in real-world scenarios. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tw-repository/AsyReC.</p></details> |  |
| **[STREAK: Streaming Network for Continual Learning of Object Relocations under Household Context Drifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05549v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world settings, robots are expected to assist humans across diverse tasks and still continuously adapt to dynamic changes over time. For example, in domestic environments, robots can proactively help users by fetching needed objects based on learned routines, which they infer by observing how objects move over time. However, data from these interactions are inherently non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.), e.g., a robot assisting multiple users may encounter varying data distributions as individuals follow distinct habits. This creates a challenge: integrating new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose STREAK (Spatio Temporal RElocation with Adaptive Knowledge retention), a continual learning framework for real-world robotic learning. It leverages a streaming graph neural network with regularization and rehearsal techniques to mitigate context drifts while retaining past knowledge. Our method is time- and memory-efficient, enabling long-term learning without retraining on all past data, which becomes infeasible as data grows in real-world interactions. We evaluate STREAK on the task of incrementally predicting human routines over 50+ days across different households. Results show that it effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting while maintaining generalization, making it a scalable solution for long-term human-robot interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextualized Messages Boost Graph Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12529v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to process data that may be represented as graphs. This has prompted several studies to explore their representational capability based on the graph isomorphism task. Notably, these works inherently assume a countable node feature representation, potentially limiting their applicability. Interestingly, only a few study GNNs with uncountable node feature representation. In the paper, a new perspective on the representational capability of GNNs is investigated across all levels$\unicode{x2014}$node-level, neighborhood-level, and graph-level$\unicode{x2014}$when the space of node feature representation is uncountable. Specifically, the injective and metric requirements of previous works are softly relaxed by employing a pseudometric distance on the space of input to create a soft-injective function such that distinct inputs may produce similar outputs if and only if the pseudometric deems the inputs to be sufficiently similar on some representation. As a consequence, a simple and computationally efficient soft-isomorphic relational graph convolution network (SIR-GCN) that emphasizes the contextualized transformation of neighborhood feature representations via anisotropic and dynamic message functions is proposed. Furthermore, a mathematical discussion on the relationship between SIR-GCN and key GNNs in literature is laid out to put the contribution into context, establishing SIR-GCN as a generalization of classical GNN methodologies. To close, experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the relative superiority of SIR-GCN, outperforming comparable models in node and graph property prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Relational Deep Learning with Pretrained Tabular Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04934v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational databases, organized into tables connected by primary-foreign key relationships, are a common format for organizing data. Making predictions on relational data often involves transforming them into a flat tabular format through table joins and feature engineering, which serve as input to tabular methods. However, designing features that fully capture complex relational patterns remains challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a compelling alternative by inherently modeling these relationships, but their time overhead during inference limits their applicability for real-time scenarios. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging existing feature engineering efforts to enhance the efficiency of GNNs in relational databases. Specifically, we use GNNs to capture complex relationships within relational databases, patterns that are difficult to featurize, while employing engineered features to encode temporal information, thereby avoiding the need to retain the entire historical graph and enabling the use of smaller, more efficient graphs. Our \textsc{LightRDL} approach not only improves efficiency, but also outperforms existing models. Experimental results on the RelBench benchmark demonstrate that our framework achieves up to $33\%$ performance improvement and a $526\times$ inference speedup compared to GNNs, making it highly suitable for real-time inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[BriLLM: Brain-inspired Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11299v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper reports the first brain-inspired large language model (BriLLM). This is a non-Transformer, non-GPT, non-traditional machine learning input-output controlled generative language model. The model is based on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) definition on the directed graph in terms of the neural network, and has the interpretability of all nodes on the graph of the whole model, instead of the traditional machine learning model that only has limited interpretability at the input and output ends. In the language model scenario, the token is defined as a node in the graph. A randomly shaped or user-defined signal flow flows between nodes on the principle of "least resistance" along paths. The next token or node to be predicted or generated is the target of the signal flow. As a language model, BriLLM theoretically supports infinitely long $n$-gram models when the model size is independent of the input and predicted length of the model. The model's working signal flow provides the possibility of recall activation and innate multi-modal support similar to the cognitive patterns of the human brain. At present, we released the first BriLLM version in Chinese, with 4000 tokens, 32-dimensional node width, 16-token long sequence prediction ability, and language model prediction performance comparable to GPT-1. More computing power will help us explore the infinite possibilities depicted above.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attentional Graph Meta-Learning for Indoor Localization Using Extremely Sparse Fingerprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04829v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fingerprint-based indoor localization is often labor-intensive due to the need for dense grids and repeated measurements across time and space. Maintaining high localization accuracy with extremely sparse fingerprints remains a persistent challenge. Existing benchmark methods primarily rely on the measured fingerprints, while neglecting valuable spatial and environmental characteristics. In this paper, we propose a systematic integration of an Attentional Graph Neural Network (AGNN) model, capable of learning spatial adjacency relationships and aggregating information from neighboring fingerprints, and a meta-learning framework that utilizes datasets with similar environmental characteristics to enhance model training. To minimize the labor required for fingerprint collection, we introduce two novel data augmentation strategies: 1) unlabeled fingerprint augmentation using moving platforms, which enables the semi-supervised AGNN model to incorporate information from unlabeled fingerprints, and 2) synthetic labeled fingerprint augmentation through environmental digital twins, which enhances the meta-learning framework through a practical distribution alignment, which can minimize the feature discrepancy between synthetic and real-world fingerprints effectively. By integrating these novel modules, we propose the Attentional Graph Meta-Learning (AGML) model. This novel model combines the strengths of the AGNN model and the meta-learning framework to address the challenges posed by extremely sparse fingerprints. To validate our approach, we collected multiple datasets from both consumer-grade WiFi devices and professional equipment across diverse environments. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the AGML model-based localization method consistently outperforms all baseline methods using sparse fingerprints across all evaluated metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attentional Graph Neural Network Is All You Need for Robust Massive Network Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16856v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we design Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms to tackle an important yet challenging nonlinear regression problem: massive network localization. We first review our previous network localization method based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which can exhibit state-of-the-art localization accuracy, even under severe Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions, by carefully preselecting a constant threshold for determining adjacency. As an extension, we propose a specially designed Attentional GNN (AGNN) model to resolve the sensitive thresholding issue of the GCN-based method and enhance the underlying model capacity. The AGNN comprises an Adjacency Learning Module (ALM) and Multiple Graph Attention Layers (MGAL), employing distinct attention architectures to systematically address the demerits of the GCN-based method, rendering it more practical for real-world applications. Comprehensive analyses are conducted to explain the superior performance of these methods, including a theoretical analysis of the AGNN's dynamic attention property and computational complexity, along with a systematic discussion of their robust characteristic against NLOS measurements. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GCN-based and AGNN-based network localization methods. Notably, integrating attention mechanisms into the AGNN yields substantial improvements in localization accuracy, approaching the fundamental lower bound and showing approximately 37\% to 53\% reduction in localization error compared to the vanilla GCN-based method across various NLOS noise configurations. Both methods outperform all competing approaches by far in terms of localization accuracy, robustness, and computational time, especially for considerably large network sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Hierarchical Protein Multi-Modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04770v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks. Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural information. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Through extensive experiments on a diverse set of protein-related tasks, our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including react (enzyme/EC classification), model quality assessment (MQA), protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (LBA), protein-protein binding site prediction (PPBS), and B cell epitopes prediction (BCEs). Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of BIHIERARCHICAL FUSION in bridging sequence and structural modalities.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional statistical methods struggle with nonlinear effects, while machine learning models often fail to capture geographical (nearby areas being more similar) and topological (unequal connectivity between places) effects in an interpretable way. To address this, we propose MedGNN, a spatio-topologically explicit framework that constructs a 2-hop spatial graph, integrating positional and locational node embeddings with urban characteristics in a graph neural network. Applied to MEDSAT, a comprehensive dataset covering over 150 environmental and socio-demographic factors and six prescription outcomes (depression, anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and opioids) across 4,835 Greater London neighborhoods, MedGNN improved predictions by over 25% on average compared to baseline methods. Using depression prescriptions as a case study, we analyzed graph embeddings via geographical principal component analysis, identifying findings that: align with prior research (e.g., higher antidepressant prescriptions among older and White populations), contribute to ongoing debates (e.g., greenery linked to higher and NO2 to lower prescriptions), and warrant further study (e.g., canopy evaporation correlated with fewer prescriptions). These results demonstrate MedGNN's potential, and more broadly, of carefully applied machine learning, to advance transdisciplinary public health research.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages' main content.

| **[Sparsity-Aware Communication for Distributed Graph Neural Network Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04673v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a computationally efficient method to learn embeddings and classifications on graph data. However, GNN training has low computational intensity, making communication costs the bottleneck for scalability. Sparse-matrix dense-matrix multiplication (SpMM) is the core computational operation in full-graph training of GNNs. Previous work parallelizing this operation focused on sparsity-oblivious algorithms, where matrix elements are communicated regardless of the sparsity pattern. This leads to a predictable communication pattern that can be overlapped with computation and enables the use of collective communication operations at the expense of wasting significant bandwidth by communicating unnecessary data. We develop sparsity-aware algorithms that tackle the communication bottlenecks in GNN training with three novel approaches. First, we communicate only the necessary matrix elements. Second, we utilize a graph partitioning model to reorder the matrix and drastically reduce the amount of communicated elements. Finally, we address the high load imbalance in communication with a tailored partitioning model, which minimizes both the total communication volume and the maximum sending volume. We further couple these sparsity-exploiting approaches with a communication-avoiding approach (1.5D parallel SpMM) in which submatrices are replicated to reduce communication. We explore the tradeoffs of these combined optimizations and show up to 14X improvement on 256 GPUs and on some instances reducing communication to almost zero resulting in a communication-free parallel training relative to a popular GNN framework based on communication-oblivious SpMM.</p></details> |  |

Traditional track reconstruction algorithms scale poorly with the number of particles within the accelerator. The Exa.TrkX project, to alleviate this computational burden, introduces a pipeline that reduces particle track reconstruction to edge classification on a graph, and uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to produce particle tracks. However, this GNN-based approach is memory-prohibitive and skips graphs that would exceed GPU memory. We introduce improvements to the Exa.TrkX pipeline to train on samples of input particle graphs, and show that these improvements generalize to higher precision and recall. In addition, we adapt performance optimizations, introduced for GNN training, to fit our augmented Exa.TrkX pipeline. These optimizations provide a $2\times$ speedup over our baseline implementation in PyTorch Geometric.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Network (GNN) execution involves both compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels, the latter dominates the total time, being significantly bottlenecked by data movement between memory and processors. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) systems can alleviate this data movement bottleneck by placing simple processors near or inside to memory arrays. In this work, we introduce PyGim, an efficient ML library that accelerates GNNs on real PIM systems. We propose intelligent parallelization techniques for memory-intensive kernels of GNNs tailored for real PIM systems, and develop handy Python API for them. We provide hybrid GNN execution, in which the compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels are executed in processor-centric and memory-centric computing systems, respectively. We extensively evaluate PyGim on a real-world PIM system with 1992 PIM cores using emerging GNN models, and demonstrate that it outperforms its state-of-the-art CPU counterpart on Intel Xeon by on average 3.04x, and achieves higher resource utilization than CPU and GPU systems.

Most solutions to this problem remain confined to the task of node classification. In this article, we focus on the valuable task of link prediction under heterophily, an interesting problem for recommendation systems, social network analysis, and other applications. GNNs like GRAFF have improved node classification under heterophily by incorporating physics biases in the architecture. Similarly, we propose GRAFF-LP, an extension of GRAFF for link prediction. We show that GRAFF-LP effectively discriminates existing from non-existing edges by learning implicitly to separate the edge gradients. Based on this information, we propose a new readout function inspired by physics. Remarkably, this new function not only enhances the performance of GRAFF-LP but also improves that of other baseline models, leading us to reconsider how every link prediction experiment has been conducted so far. Finally, we provide evidence that even simple GNNs did not experience greater difficulty in predicting heterophilic links compared to homophilic ones. This leads us to believe in the necessity for heterophily measures specifically tailored for link prediction, distinct from those used in node classification.

Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain.

| **[PIORF: Physics-Informed Ollivier-Ricci Flow for Long-Range Interactions in Mesh Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04052v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, data-driven simulators based on graph neural networks have gained attention in modeling physical systems on unstructured meshes. However, they struggle with long-range dependencies in fluid flows, particularly in refined mesh regions. This challenge, known as the 'over-squashing' problem, hinders information propagation. While existing graph rewiring methods address this issue to some extent, they only consider graph topology, overlooking the underlying physical phenomena. We propose Physics-Informed Ollivier-Ricci Flow (PIORF), a novel rewiring method that combines physical correlations with graph topology. PIORF uses Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC) to identify bottleneck regions and connects these areas with nodes in high-velocity gradient nodes, enabling long-range interactions and mitigating over-squashing. Our approach is computationally efficient in rewiring edges and can scale to larger simulations. Experimental results on 3 fluid dynamics benchmark datasets show that PIORF consistently outperforms baseline models and existing rewiring methods, achieving up to 26.2 improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[TGraphX: Tensor-Aware Graph Neural Network for Multi-Dimensional Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03953v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>TGraphX presents a novel paradigm in deep learning by unifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance visual reasoning tasks. Traditional CNNs excel at extracting rich spatial features from images but lack the inherent capability to model inter-object relationships. Conversely, conventional GNNs typically rely on flattened node features, thereby discarding vital spatial details. TGraphX overcomes these limitations by employing CNNs to generate multi-dimensional node features (e.g., (3*128*128) tensors) that preserve local spatial semantics. These spatially aware nodes participate in a graph where message passing is performed using 1*1 convolutions, which fuse adjacent features while maintaining their structure. Furthermore, a deep CNN aggregator with residual connections is used to robustly refine the fused messages, ensuring stable gradient flow and end-to-end trainability. Our approach not only bridges the gap between spatial feature extraction and relational reasoning but also demonstrates significant improvements in object detection refinement and ensemble reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to arXiv.

Current strategies for processing point clouds typically downsample the scene or divide it into smaller parts for separate analysis. However, both approaches risk losing key local details or global contextual information. In this paper, we introduce PerLA, a 3D language assistant designed to be more perceptive to both details and context, making visual representations more informative for the LLM. PerLA captures high-resolution (local) details in parallel from different point cloud areas and integrates them with (global) context obtained from a lower-resolution whole point cloud. We present a novel algorithm that preserves point cloud locality through the Hilbert curve and effectively aggregates local-to-global information via cross-attention and a graph neural network. Lastly, we introduce a novel loss for local representation consensus to promote training stability. PerLA outperforms state-of-the-art 3D language assistants, with gains of up to +1.34 CiDEr on ScanQA for question answering, and +4.22 on ScanRefer and +3.88 on Nr3D for dense captioning. https://gfmei.github.io/PerLA/</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

For this reason, reducing the number of two-qubit gates is of paramount importance on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. To advance towards more reliable quantum computing, we introduce a framework based on ZX calculus, graph-neural networks and reinforcement learning for quantum circuit optimization. By combining reinforcement learning and tree search, our method addresses the challenge of selecting optimal sequences of ZX calculus rewrite rules. Instead of relying on existing heuristic rules for minimizing circuits, our method trains a novel reinforcement learning policy that directly operates on ZX-graphs, therefore allowing us to search through the space of all possible circuit transformations to find a circuit significantly minimizing the number of CNOT gates. This way we can scale beyond hard-coded rules towards discovering arbitrary optimization rules. We demonstrate our method's competetiveness with state-of-the-art circuit optimizers and generalization capabilities on large sets of diverse random circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proximal Policy Optimization with Graph Neural Networks for Optimal Power Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12470v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a very traditional research area within the power systems field that seeks for the optimal operation point of electric power plants, and which needs to be solved every few minutes in real-world scenarios. However, due to the nonconvexities that arise in power generation systems, there is not yet a fast, robust solution technique for the full Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). In the last decades, power grids have evolved into a typical dynamic, non-linear and large-scale control system, known as the power system, so searching for better and faster ACOPF solutions is becoming crucial. Appearance of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has allowed the natural use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on graph data, such as power networks. On the other hand, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is known for its powerful capability to solve complex decision-making problems. Although solutions that use these two methods separately are beginning to appear in the literature, none has yet combined the advantages of both. We propose a novel architecture based on the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm with Graph Neural Networks to solve the Optimal Power Flow. The objective is to design an architecture that learns how to solve the optimization problem and that is at the same time able to generalize to unseen scenarios. We compare our solution with the DCOPF in terms of cost after having trained our DRL agent on IEEE 30 bus system and then computing the OPF on that base network with topology changes</p></details> |  |

Within the realm of music recommendation, graphs play a crucial role in enhancing genre-based recommendations by integrating Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) with advanced graph embeddings. This study explores the efficacy of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Transformer (GT) models in learning embeddings that effectively capture intricate relationships between music items and genres represented within graph structures. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse real-world music datasets, our findings consistently demonstrate that these graph-based approaches outperform traditional methods that rely solely on MFCC features or collaborative filtering techniques. Specifically, the graph-enhanced models achieve notably higher accuracy in predicting genre-specific preferences and offering relevant music suggestions to users. These results underscore the effectiveness of utilizing graph embeddings to enrich feature representations and exploit latent associations within music data, thereby illustrating their potential to advance the capabilities of personalized and context-aware music recommendation systems.

| **[Certified Defense on the Fairness of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02757v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent graph learning model in various graph-based tasks over the years. Nevertheless, due to the vulnerabilities of GNNs, it has been empirically proved that malicious attackers could easily corrupt the fairness level of their predictions by adding perturbations to the input graph data. In this paper, we take crucial steps to study a novel problem of certifiable defense on the fairness level of GNNs. Specifically, we propose a principled framework named ELEGANT and present a detailed theoretical certification analysis for the fairness of GNNs. ELEGANT takes any GNNs as its backbone, and the fairness level of such a backbone is theoretically impossible to be corrupted under certain perturbation budgets for attackers. Notably, ELEGANT does not have any assumption over the GNN structure or parameters, and does not require re-training the GNNs to realize certification. Hence it can serve as a plug-and-play framework for any optimized GNNs ready to be deployed. We verify the satisfactory effectiveness of ELEGANT in practice through extensive experiments on real-world datasets across different backbones of GNNs, where ELEGANT is also demonstrated to be beneficial for GNN debiasing.

Despite these advancements, the performance of GNNs on heterogeneous graphs often remains complex, with networks generally underperforming compared to their homogeneous counterparts. This work benchmarks various GNN architectures to identify the most effective methods for heterogeneous graphs, with a particular focus on node classification and link prediction. Our findings reveal that graph attention networks excel in these tasks. As a main contribution, we explore enhancements to these attention networks by integrating positional encodings for node embeddings. This involves utilizing the full Laplacian spectrum to accurately capture both the relative and absolute positions of each node within the graph, further enhancing performance on downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Rheumatoid Arthritis and Sjogren's Disease multistain datasets. Beyond performance metrics, BioX-CPath provides interpretable insights through stain attention scores, entropy measures, and stain interaction scores, that permit measuring model alignment with known pathological mechanisms. This biological grounding, combined with strong classification performance, makes BioX-CPath particularly suitable for clinical applications where interpretability is key.

The architecture and connectivity of the MI-HGNN are constructed from the robot morphology, in which nodes and edges are robot joints and links, respectively.

We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness, generalization ability, model efficiency, and sample efficiency. Our MI-HGNN improved the performance of a state-of-the-art model that leverages robot morphological symmetry by 8.4% with only 0.21% of its parameters. Although MI-HGNN is applied to contact perception problems for legged robots in this work, it can be seamlessly applied to other types of multi-body dynamical systems and has the potential to improve other robot learning frameworks.

| **[A Hybrid Similarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02615v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node classification has gained significant importance in graph deep learning with real-world applications such as recommendation systems, drug discovery, and citation networks. Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Transformers have achieved superior performance in node classification tasks. However, the key concern with Graph Convolutional Networks is over-squashing, which limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies in the network. Additionally, Graph Transformers face scalability challenges, making it difficult to process large graphs efficiently. To address this, we propose a novel framework, A Hybrid SImilarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification (SIGNNet), which capitalizes on local and global structural information, enhances the model's capability to effectively capture fine-grained relationships and broader contextual patterns within the graph structure. The proposed method leverages Graph Convolutional Networks alongside a score-based mechanism to effectively capture local and global node interactions while addressing the limitations of over-squashing. Our proposed method employs a novel Personalized PageRank-based node sampling method to address scalability issues by generating subgraphs of nodes. Additionally, SIGNNet incorporates a novel attention mechanism, Structure-Aware Multi-Head Attention (SA-MHA), which integrates node structural information for informed attention weighting, enabling the model to prioritize nodes based on topological significance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods, with average accuracy gains of 6.03%, 5.47%, 4.78%, 19.10%, 19.61%, 7.22%, 19.54%, and 14.94% on Cora, Citeseer, CS, Wisconsin, Texas, Actor, Cornell and Chameleon datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward General and Robust LLM-enhanced Text-attributed Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02343v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the proliferation of Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) across various domains have positioned LLM-enhanced TAG learning as a critical research area. By utilizing rich graph descriptions, this paradigm leverages LLMs to generate high-quality embeddings, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the field faces significant challenges: (1) the absence of a unified framework to systematize the diverse optimization perspectives arising from the complex interactions between LLMs and GNNs, and (2) the lack of a robust method capable of handling real-world TAGs, which often suffer from texts and edge sparsity, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose UltraTAG, a unified pipeline for LLM-enhanced TAG learning. UltraTAG provides a unified comprehensive and domain-adaptive framework that not only organizes existing methodologies but also paves the way for future advancements in the field. Building on this framework, we propose UltraTAG-S, a robust instantiation of UltraTAG designed to tackle the inherent sparsity issues in real-world TAGs. UltraTAG-S employs LLM-based text propagation and text augmentation to mitigate text sparsity, while leveraging LLM-augmented node selection techniques based on PageRank and edge reconfiguration strategies to address edge sparsity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraTAG-S significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving improvements of 2.12\% and 17.47\% in ideal and sparse settings, respectively. Moreover, as the data sparsity ratio increases, the performance improvement of UltraTAG-S also rises, which underscores the effectiveness and robustness of UltraTAG-S.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Customer Contact Efficiency with Graph Neural Networks in Credit Card Fraud Detection Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02275v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Credit card fraud has been a persistent issue since the last century, causing significant financial losses to the industry. The most effective way to prevent fraud is by contacting customers to verify suspicious transactions. However, while these systems are designed to detect fraudulent activity, they often mistakenly flag legitimate transactions, leading to unnecessary declines that disrupt the user experience and erode customer trust. Frequent false positives can frustrate customers, resulting in dissatisfaction, increased complaints, and a diminished sense of security. To address these limitations, we propose a fraud detection framework incorporating Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying fraudulent transactions. By leveraging the relational structure of transaction data, our model reduces the need for direct customer confirmation while maintaining high detection performance. Our experiments are conducted using the IBM credit card transaction dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.</p></details> |  |

While user-written comments provide explicit insights about preferences, merging these textual representations from large language models (LLMs) with graph-based embeddings of user actions remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose a framework that employs both a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based model and an LLM to produce review-aware representations, preserving review semantics while mitigating textual noise. Our approach utilizes a hybrid objective that balances user-item interactions against text-derived features, ensuring that user's both behavioral and linguistic signals are effectively captured. We evaluate this method on multiple datasets from diverse application domains, demonstrating consistent improvements over a baseline GNN-based recommender model. Notably, our model achieves significant gains in recommendation accuracy when review data is sparse or unevenly distributed. These findings highlight the importance of integrating LLM-driven textual feedback with GNN-derived user behavioral patterns to develop robust, context-aware recommender systems.</p></details> | Under Review |

Hierarchical variants offer a distinct advantage by analysing the time series across multiple resolutions, making them particularly effective in tasks like global weather forecasting, where low-resolution variable interactions are significant. A critical challenge in hierarchical models is information loss during forward or backward passes through the hierarchy. We propose the Hierarchical Graph Flow (HiGFlow) network, which introduces a memory buffer variable of dynamic size to store previously seen information across variable resolutions. We theoretically show two key results: HiGFlow reduces smoothness when mapping onto new feature spaces in the hierarchy and non-strictly enhances the utility of message-passing by improving Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) expressivity. Empirical results demonstrate that HiGFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including transformer models, by at least an average of 6.1% in MAE and 6.2% in RMSE.

These systems evolve under influences such as age, sex, diet, environmental exposures, and diseases, making them challenging to decode given the involvement of tens of thousands of genes and proteins. Recently, hundreds of millions of single-cell omics data have provided a robust foundation for understanding these signaling networks within various cell subpopulations and conditions. Inspired by the success of large foundation models (for example, large language models and large vision models) pre-trained on massive datasets, we introduce OmniCellTOSG, the first dataset of cell text-omic signaling graphs (TOSGs). Each TOSG represents the signaling network of an individual or meta-cell and is labeled with information such as organ, disease, sex, age, and cell subtype. OmniCellTOSG offers two key contributions. First, it introduces a novel graph model that integrates human-readable annotations -- such as biological functions, cellular locations, signaling pathways, related diseases, and drugs -- with quantitative gene and protein abundance data, enabling graph reasoning to decode cell signaling. This approach calls for new joint models combining large language models and graph neural networks. Second, the dataset is built from single-cell RNA sequencing data of approximately 120 million cells from diverse tissues and conditions (healthy and diseased) and is fully compatible with PyTorch. This facilitates the development of innovative cell signaling models that could transform research in life sciences, healthcare, and precision medicine. The OmniCellTOSG dataset is continuously expanding and will be updated regularly. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/FuhaiLiAiLab/OmniCellTOSG.</p></details> |  |

Current methods often struggle with sparse or noisy data and rely on static graphs, limiting their ability to capture dynamic changes between nodes and relationships. This paper introduces LL4G, a self-supervised framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to optimize graph neural networks (GNNs). LLMs extract rich semantic features to generate node representations and to infer explicit and implicit relationships. The graph structure adaptively adds nodes and edges based on input data, continuously optimizing itself. The GNN then uses these optimized representations for joint training on node reconstruction, edge prediction, and contrastive learning tasks. This integration of semantic and structural information generates robust personality profiles. Experimental results on Kaggle and Pandora datasets show LL4G outperforms state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Text to Graph: Leveraging Graph Neural Networks for Enhanced Explainability in NLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02064v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have relegated natural language processing tasks to Transformer-type models, particularly generative models, because these models exhibit high versatility when performing generation and classification tasks. As the size of these models increases, they achieve outstanding results. Given their widespread use, many explainability techniques are developed based on these models. However, this process becomes computationally expensive due to the large size of the models. Additionally, transformers interpret input information through tokens that fragment input words into sequences lacking inherent semantic meaning, complicating the explanation of the model from the very beginning. This study proposes a novel methodology to achieve explainability in natural language processing tasks by automatically converting sentences into graphs and maintaining semantics through nodes and relations that express fundamental linguistic concepts. It also allows the subsequent exploitation of this knowledge in subsequent tasks, making it possible to obtain trends and understand how the model associates the different elements inside the text with the explained task. The experiments delivered promising results in determining the most critical components within the text structure for a given classification.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Abusive Language Detection (ALD) models often overlook this context, which can lead to unreliable performance metrics. Recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods that integrate conversational context often depend on limited and simplified representations, and report inconsistent results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) to model social media conversations as graphs, where nodes represent comments, and edges capture reply structures. We systematically investigate various graph representations and context windows to identify the optimal configuration for ALD. Our GNN model outperform both context-agnostic baselines and linear context-aware methods, achieving significant improvements in F1 scores. These findings demonstrate the critical role of structured conversational context and establish GNNs as a robust framework for advancing context-aware abusive language detection.</p></details> |  |

We train them to predict spatial position of points in a discrete 2D grid from a set of constraints that uniquely describe hidden figures containing these points. Both models are able to predict the position of points and interestingly, they form the hidden figures described by the input constraints in the embedding space during the reasoning process. Our analysis shows that both models recover the grid structure during training so that the embeddings corresponding to the points within the grid organize themselves in a 2D subspace and reflect the neighborhood structure of the grid. We also show that the Graph Neural Network we design for the task performs significantly better than the Transformer and is also easier to scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00490v4)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by WWW2025</p></details> |

We consider various obfuscation types and obfuscators, resulting in two complex datasets.

In recent years, various studies in the vision domain have made notable advancements in this area. However, the varying topological structures and non-grid nature of graph data render the methods from the vision domain ineffective. Building upon prior research into differentiable methods for graph neural networks, we propose a fast and high-quality data-free knowledge distillation approach in this paper. Without compromising distillation quality, the proposed graph-free KD method (ACGKD) significantly reduces the spatial complexity of pseudo-graphs by leveraging the Binary Concrete distribution to model the graph structure and introducing a spatial complexity tuning parameter. This approach enables efficient gradient computation for the graph structure, thereby accelerating the overall distillation process. Additionally, ACGKD eliminates the dimensional ambiguity between the student and teacher models by increasing the student's dimensions and reusing the teacher's classifier. Moreover, it equips graph knowledge distillation with a CL-based strategy to ensure the student learns graph structures progressively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACGKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in distilling knowledge from GNNs without training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Graph Reinforcement Learning for UAV-Enabled Multi-User Secure Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01446v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with flexible mobility are envisioned to enhance physical layer security in wireless communications, the efficient security design that adapts to such high network dynamics is rather challenging. The conventional approaches extended from optimization perspectives are usually quite involved, especially when jointly considering factors in different scales such as deployment and transmission in UAV-related scenarios. In this paper, we address the UAV-enabled multi-user secure communications by proposing a deep graph reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we reinterpret the security beamforming as a graph neural network (GNN) learning task, where mutual interference among users is managed through the message-passing mechanism. Then, the UAV deployment is obtained through soft actor-critic reinforcement learning, where the GNN-based security beamforming is exploited to guide the deployment strategy update. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal security performance and significantly enhances the efficiency of strategy determination.

| **[Refining Interactions: Enhancing Anisotropy in Graph Neural Networks with Language Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01429v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has recently been explored to enhance the capabilities of Text Attribute Graphs (TAGs). Most existing methods feed textual descriptions of the graph structure or neighbouring nodes' text directly into LLMs. However, these approaches often cause LLMs to treat structural information simply as general contextual text, thus limiting their effectiveness in graph-related tasks. In this paper, we introduce LanSAGNN (Language Semantic Anisotropic Graph Neural Network), a framework that extends the concept of anisotropic GNNs to the natural language level. This model leverages LLMs to extract tailor-made semantic information for node pairs, effectively capturing the unique interactions within node relationships. In addition, we propose an efficient dual-layer LLMs finetuning architecture to better align LLMs' outputs with graph tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LanSAGNN significantly enhances existing LLM-based methods without increasing complexity while also exhibiting strong robustness against interference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |
| **[HCAF-DTA: drug-target binding affinity prediction with cross-attention fused hypergraph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02014v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of the binding affinity between drugs and target proteins is a core task in computer-aided drug design. Existing deep learning methods tend to ignore the information of internal sub-structural features of drug molecules and drug-target interactions, resulting in limited prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a drug-target association prediction model HCAF-DTA based on cross-attention fusion hypergraph neural network. The model innovatively introduces hypergraph representation in the feature extraction stage: drug molecule hypergraphs are constructed based on the tree decomposition algorithm, and the sub-structural and global features extracted by fusing the hypergraph neural network with the graphical neural network through hopping connections, in which the hyper edges can efficiently characterise the functional functional groups and other key chemical features; for the protein feature extraction, a weighted graph is constructed based on the residues predicted by the ESM model contact maps to construct weighted graphs, and multilayer graph neural networks were used to capture spatial dependencies. In the prediction stage, a bidirectional multi-head cross-attention mechanism is designed to model intermolecular interactions from the dual viewpoints of atoms and amino acids, and cross-modal features with correlated information are fused by attention. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Davis and KIBA show that HCAF-DTA outperforms state of the arts in all three performance evaluation metrics, with the MSE metrics reaching 0.198 and 0.122, respectively, with an improvement of up to 4% from the optimal baseline.</p></details> |  |

It leads to a decline in memory, reasoning ability, and behavior, especially in older people. The cause of Alzheimer's Disease is still under exploration and there is no all-inclusive theory that can explain the pathologies in each individual patient. Nevertheless, early intervention has been found to be effective in managing symptoms and slowing down the disease's progression. Recent research has utilized electroencephalography (EEG) data to identify biomarkers that distinguish Alzheimer's Disease patients from healthy individuals. Prior studies have used various machine learning methods, including deep learning and graph neural networks, to examine electroencephalography-based signals for identifying Alzheimer's Disease patients. In our research, we proposed a Flexible and Explainable Gated Graph Convolutional Network (GGCN) with Multi-Objective Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (MOTPE) hyperparameter tuning. This provides a flexible solution that efficiently identifies the optimal number of GGCN blocks to achieve the optimized precision, specificity, and recall outcomes, as well as the optimized area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC). Our findings demonstrated a high efficacy with an over 0.9 Receiver Operating Characteristic score, alongside precision, specificity, and recall scores in distinguishing health control with Alzheimer's Disease patients in Moderate to Severe Dementia using the power spectrum density (PSD) of electroencephalography signals across various frequency bands. Moreover, our research enhanced the interpretability of the embedded adjacency matrices, revealing connectivity differences in frontal and parietal brain regions between Alzheimer's patients and healthy individuals.</p></details> |  |

Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently emerged as leading models in geometric deep learning, outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in various graph learning tasks. However, the development of tokenizers for graphs has lagged behind other modalities. To address this, we introduce GQT (\textbf{G}raph \textbf{Q}uantized \textbf{T}okenizer), which decouples tokenizer training from Transformer training by leveraging multi-task graph self-supervised learning, yielding robust and generalizable graph tokens. Furthermore, the GQT utilizes Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to learn hierarchical discrete tokens, resulting in significantly reduced memory requirements and improved generalization capabilities. By combining the GQT with token modulation, a Transformer encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on 20 out of 22 benchmarks, including large-scale homophilic and heterophilic datasets.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, GNNs may produce biased predictions against certain demographic subgroups due to node attributes and neighbors surrounding a node. Most current research on GNN fairness focuses predominantly on debiasing GNNs using oversimplified fairness evaluation metrics, which can give a misleading impression of fairness. Understanding the potential evaluation paradoxes due to the complicated nature of the graph structure is crucial for developing effective GNN debiasing mechanisms. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of current GNN debiasing methods in terms of unfairness evaluation. Specifically, we introduce a community-level strategy to measure bias in GNNs and evaluate debiasing methods at this level. Further, We introduce ComFairGNN, a novel framework designed to mitigate community-level bias in GNNs. Our approach employs a learnable coreset-based debiasing function that addresses bias arising from diverse local neighborhood distributions during GNNs neighborhood aggregation. Comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate our model's effectiveness in both accuracy and fairness metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at PAKDD 2025</p></details> |

We introduce several training improvements, particularly a novel closest assignment supervision method that dynamically adapts to the model's current state, significantly enhancing performance on problems with larger solution spaces. Our experiments demonstrate the suitability of variable-clause graph representations with recurrent neural network updates, which achieve good accuracy on SAT assignment prediction while reducing computational demands. We extend the base graph neural network into a diffusion model that facilitates incremental sampling and can be effectively combined with classical techniques like unit propagation. Through analysis of embedding space patterns and optimization trajectories, we show how these networks implicitly perform a process very similar to continuous relaxations of MaxSAT, offering an interpretable view of their reasoning process. This understanding guides our design choices and explains the ability of recurrent architectures to scale effectively at inference time beyond their training distribution, which we demonstrate with test-time scaling experiments.</p></details> |  |

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown promise in modeling brain connectivity for AD diagnosis, yet their reliance on linear transformations limits their ability to capture intricate nonlinear patterns in neuroimaging data. To address this, we propose GCN-KAN, a novel single-modal framework that integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) into GCNs to enhance both diagnostic accuracy and interpretability. Leveraging structural MRI data, our model employs learnable spline-based transformations to better represent brain region interactions. Evaluated on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, GCN-KAN outperforms traditional GCNs by 4-8% in classification accuracy while providing interpretable insights into key brain regions associated with AD.

Although graph neural networks have achieved remarkable progress in functional network analysis, challenges such as data scarcity and insufficient supervision persist. To address the limitations of limited training data and inadequate supervision, this paper proposes a novel model named PHGCL-DDGformer that integrates graph contrastive learning with graph transformers, effectively enhancing the representation learning capability for brain network classification tasks. To overcome the constraints of existing graph contrastive learning methods in brain network feature extraction, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy combining attribute masking and edge perturbation is implemented for data enhancement. Subsequently, a dual-domain graph transformer (DDGformer) module is constructed to integrate local and global information, where graph convolutional networks aggregate neighborhood features to capture local patterns while attention mechanisms extract global dependencies. Finally, a graph contrastive learning framework is established to maximize the consistency between positive and negative pairs, thereby obtaining high-quality graph representations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the PHGCL-DDGformer model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in brain network classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, uses tikz.sty</p></details> |

While particle-scale simulations provide detailed insights into these interactions, their computational cost is often prohibitive. Attended by researchers from both the granular materials (GM) and machine learning (ML) communities, a recent Lorentz Center Workshop on "Machine Learning for Discrete Granular Media" brought the ML community up to date with GM challenges. This position paper emerged from the workshop discussions. We define granular materials and identify seven key challenges that characterise their distinctive behaviour across various scales and regimes, ranging from gas-like to fluid-like and solid-like. Addressing these challenges is essential for developing robust and efficient digital twins for granular systems in various industrial applications. To showcase the potential of ML to the GM community, we present classical and emerging machine/deep learning techniques that have been, or could be, applied to granular materials. We reviewed sequence-based learning models for path-dependent constitutive behaviour, followed by encoder-decoder type models for representing high-dimensional data. We then explore graph neural networks and recent advances in neural operator learning. Lastly, we discuss model-order reduction and probabilistic learning techniques for high-dimensional parameterised systems, which are crucial for quantifying uncertainties arising from physics-based and data-driven models. We present a workflow aimed at unifying data structures and modelling pipelines and guiding readers through the selection, training, and deployment of ML surrogates for granular material simulations. Finally, we illustrate the workflow's practical use with two representative examples, focusing on granular materials in solid-like and fluid-like regimes.</p></details> | 35 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Designing Heterogeneous GNNs with Desired Permutation Properties for Wireless Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03906v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been designed for learning a variety of wireless policies, i.e., the mappings from environment parameters to decision variables, thanks to their superior performance, and the potential in enabling scalability and size generalizability. These merits are rooted in leveraging permutation prior, i.e., satisfying the permutation property of the policy to be learned (referred to as desired permutation property). Many wireless policies are with complicated permutation properties. To satisfy these properties, heterogeneous GNNs (HetGNNs) should be used to learn such policies. There are two critical factors that enable a HetGNN to satisfy a desired permutation property: constructing an appropriate heterogeneous graph and judiciously designing the architecture of the HetGNN. However, both the graph and the HetGNN are designed heuristically so far. In this paper, we strive to provide a systematic approach for the design to satisfy the desired permutation property. We first propose a method for constructing a graph for a policy, where the edges and their types are defined for the sake of satisfying complicated permutation properties. Then, we provide and prove three sufficient conditions to design a HetGNN such that it can satisfy the desired permutation property when learning over an appropriate graph. These conditions suggest a method of designing the HetGNN with desired permutation property by sharing the processing, combining, and pooling functions according to the types of vertices and edges of the graph. We take power allocation and hybrid precoding policies as examples for demonstrating how to apply the proposed methods and validating the impact of the permutation prior by simulations.</p></details> |  |

Graphs from real-world datasets often evolve over time, with newly emerging edges and dynamically changing node properties, posing a significant challenge for this problem. In response, temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have been developed to predict dynamic node properties from a stream of emerging edges. However, our analysis reveals that most TGNN-based methods are (a) far less effective without proper node features and, due to their complex model architectures, (b) vulnerable to distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose SPLASH, a simple yet powerful method for predicting node properties on edge streams under distribution shifts. Our key contributions are as follows: (1) we propose feature augmentation methods and an automatic feature selection method for edge streams, which improve the effectiveness of TGNNs, (2) we propose a lightweight MLP-based TGNN architecture that is highly efficient and robust under distribution shifts, and (3) we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, generalization, and qualitative performance of the proposed method and its competitors on dynamic node classification, dynamic anomaly detection, and node affinity prediction tasks across seven real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, To Appear in ICDE 2025</p></details> |

Existing GNNs primarily operate in Euclidean spaces, which can limit their ability to capture hierarchical and multi-relational structures inherent to complex graphs. LGIN addresses this by incorporating curvature-aware aggregation functions that preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor, ensuring embeddings remain constrained within the hyperbolic space by proposing a new update rule that effectively captures both local neighborhood interactions and global structural properties, enabling LGIN to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs with expressiveness at least as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Through extensive evaluation across nine benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures, LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNNs, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy in modeling complex graph structures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to extend the concept of a powerful graph neural network to Riemannian manifolds, paving the way for future advancements in hyperbolic graph learning.

Therefore, they need to constantly monitor vast amounts of incoming and outgoing transactions. A particular challenge in detecting money laundering is that money launderers continuously adapt their tactics to evade detection. Hence, detection methods need constant fine-tuning. Traditional machine learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning the model on new data, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments. Continual learning methods may address this issue and enhance current anti-money laundering (AML) practices, by allowing models to incorporate new information while retaining prior knowledge. Research on continual graph learning for AML, however, is still scarce. In this review, we critically evaluate state-of-the-art continual graph learning approaches for AML applications. We categorise methods into replay-based, regularization-based, and architecture-based strategies within the graph neural network (GNN) framework, and we provide in-depth experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world AML data sets that showcase the effect of the different hyperparameters. Our analysis demonstrates that continual learning improves model adaptability and robustness in the face of extreme class imbalances and evolving fraud patterns. Finally, we outline key challenges and propose directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

To address the scalability issue of traditional TE algorithms, learning-based approaches have been proposed, showing potential of significant efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Nevertheless, the intrinsic limitations of existing learning-based methods hinder their practical application: they are not generalizable across diverse topologies and network conditions, incur excessive training overhead, and do not respect link capacities by default. This paper proposes TELGEN, a novel TE algorithm that learns to solve TE problems efficiently in large-scale networks, while achieving superior generalizability across diverse network conditions. TELGEN is based on the novel idea of transforming the problem of "predicting the optimal TE solution" into "predicting the optimal TE algorithm", which enables TELGEN to learn and efficiently approximate the end-to-end solving process of classical optimal TE algorithms. The learned algorithm is agnostic to the exact network topology or traffic patterns, and can efficiently solve TE problems given arbitrary inputs and generalize well to unseen topologies and demands. We trained and evaluated TELGEN on random and real-world networks with up to 5000 nodes and 106 links. TELGEN achieved less than 3% optimality gap while ensuring feasibility in all cases, even when the test network had up to 20x more nodes than the largest in training. It also saved up to 84% solving time than classical optimal solver, and could reduce training time per epoch and solving time by 2-4 orders of magnitude than latest learning algorithms on the largest networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backdoor Graph Condensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11025v4)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation has recently emerged as a prevalent technique to improve the training efficiency for graph neural networks (GNNs). It condenses a large graph into a small one such that a GNN trained on this small synthetic graph can achieve comparable performance to a GNN trained on the large graph. However, while existing graph condensation studies mainly focus on the best trade-off between graph size and the GNNs' performance (model utility), they overlook the security issues of graph condensation. To bridge this gap, we first explore backdoor attack against the GNNs trained on the condensed graphs. We introduce an effective backdoor attack against graph condensation, termed BGC. This attack aims to (1) preserve the condensed graph quality despite trigger injection, and (2) ensure trigger efficacy through the condensation process, achieving a high attack success rate. Specifically, BGC consistently updates triggers during condensation and targets representative nodes for poisoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. BGC achieves a high attack success rate (close to 1.0) and good model utility in all cases. Furthermore, the results against multiple defense methods demonstrate BGC's resilience under their defenses. Finally, we analyze the key hyperparameters that influence the attack performance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/JiahaoWuGit/BGC.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICDE ...</summary><p>ICDE 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

The latter consists of spray-based printing of cementitious plaster on a wall and is facilitated with the use of a robotic arm. The predictions are computed using the robotic arm trajectory features, such as position, velocity and direction, as well as the printing process parameters. The proposed approach, based on a particle representation of the wall domain and the end effector, allows for the adoption of a graph-based solution. The GNN model consists of an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and is trained using data from laboratory tests, while the hyperparameters are optimized by means of a Bayesian scheme. The aim of this model is to act as a simulator of the printing process, and ultimately used for the generation of the robotic arm trajectory and the optimization of the printing parameters, towards the materialization of an autonomous plastering process. The performance of the proposed model is assessed in terms of the prediction error against unseen ground truth data, which shows its generality in varied scenarios, as well as in comparison with the performance of an existing benchmark model. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the benchmark model, with notably better performance and enhanced error scaling across prediction steps.</p></details> |  |

While classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are renowned for their scalability and robustness, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum circuit designs, limiting their applicability to a narrower range of graph-structured problems, falling short of real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by the classical GraphSAGE approach, utilizing quantum models as aggregators. In this work, we integrate established techniques for inductive representation learning on graphs with parametrized quantum convolutional and pooling layers, effectively bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer is flexible, enabling tailored designs for specific problems. Benchmarked on a node regression task with the QM9 dataset, we demonstrate that our framework successfully models a non-trivial molecular dataset, achieving performance comparable to classical GNNs. In particular, we show that our quantum approach exhibits robust generalization across molecules with varying numbers of atoms without requiring circuit modifications, slightly outperforming classical GNNs. Furthermore, we numerically investigate the scalability of the QGNN framework. Specifically, we demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus in our architecture as the number of qubits increases, suggesting that the proposed quantum model can be extended to handle larger and more complex graph-based problems effectively.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

Traditional influence maximization strategies often fail to keep up with rapidly evolving relationships and structures, leading to missed opportunities and inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a novel learning-based approach integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) models. This hybrid framework captures both structural and temporal dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of candidate nodes for seed set selection. The bidirectional nature of BiLSTM allows our model to analyze patterns from both past and future network states, ensuring adaptability to changes over time. By dynamically adapting to graph evolution at each time snapshot, our approach improves seed set calculation efficiency, achieving an average of 90% accuracy in predicting potential seed nodes across diverse networks. This significantly reduces computational overhead by optimizing the number of nodes evaluated for seed selection. Our method is particularly effective in fields like viral marketing and social network analysis, where understanding temporal dynamics is crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, Accepted in AAAI25 to AI4TS Workshop@AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Graph neural networks extrapolate out-of-distribution for shortest paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19173v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks (NNs), despite their success and wide adoption, still struggle to extrapolate out-of-distribution (OOD), i.e., to inputs that are not well-represented by their training dataset. Addressing the OOD generalization gap is crucial when models are deployed in environments significantly different from the training set, such as applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on small graphs to large, real-world graphs. One promising approach for achieving robust OOD generalization is the framework of neural algorithmic alignment, which incorporates ideas from classical algorithms by designing neural architectures that resemble specific algorithmic paradigms (e.g. dynamic programming). The hope is that trained models of this form would have superior OOD capabilities, in much the same way that classical algorithms work for all instances. We rigorously analyze the role of algorithmic alignment in achieving OOD generalization, focusing on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to the canonical shortest path problem. We prove that GNNs, trained to minimize a sparsity-regularized loss over a small set of shortest path instances, exactly implement the Bellman-Ford (BF) algorithm for shortest paths. In fact, if a GNN minimizes this loss within an error of $\epsilon$, it implements the BF algorithm with an error of $O(\epsilon)$. Consequently, despite limited training data, these GNNs are guaranteed to extrapolate to arbitrary shortest-path problems, including instances of any size. Our empirical results support our theory by showing that NNs trained by gradient descent are able to minimize this loss and extrapolate in practice.</p></details> |  |

We propose HIS_GCNs, a hierarchical importance graph sampling based learning method. By constructing minibatches using sampled subgraphs, HIS_GCNs gives attention to the importance of both core and periphery nodes/edges in a scale-free training graph. Specifically, it preserves the centrum of the core to most minibatches, which maintains connectivity between periphery nodes, and samples periphery edges without core node interference, in order to keep more long chains composed entirely of low-degree nodes in the same minibatch. HIS_GCNs can maximize the discrete Ricci curvature (i.e., Ollivier-Ricci curvatures) of the edges in a subgraph that enables the preservation of important chains for information propagation, and can achieve a low node embedding variance and a high convergence speed. Diverse experiments on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with node classification tasks confirm superior performance of HIS_GCNs in both accuracy and training time.

While advanced models like Transformers and graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, largely due to their success in tasks like language modeling, their added complexity is not always necessary. In our work, we show that simple feedforward neural networks (SFNNs) can achieve performance on par with, or even exceeding, these state-of-the-art models, while being simpler, smaller, faster, and more robust. Our analysis indicates that, in many cases, univariate SFNNs are sufficient, implying that modeling interactions between multiple series may offer only marginal benefits. Even when inter-series relationships are strong, a basic multivariate SFNN still delivers competitive results. We also examine some key design choices and offer guidelines on making informed decisions. Additionally, we critique existing benchmarking practices and propose an improved evaluation protocol. Although SFNNs may not be optimal for every situation (hence the ``almost'' in our title) they serve as a strong baseline that future time series forecasting methods should always be compared against.</p></details> |  |

Equations offer explicit relationships between variables, enabling deeper insights into underlying data patterns. Most existing equation discovery methods rely on genetic programming, which iteratively searches the equation space but is often slow and prone to overfitting. By representing equations as directed acyclic graphs, we leverage the use of graph neural networks to learn the underlying semantics of equations, and generate new, previously unseen equations. Although graph generative models have been shown to be successful in discovering new types of graphs in many fields, there application in discovering equations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose Graph-EQ, a deep graph generative model designed for efficient equation discovery. Graph-EQ uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to learn a rich latent representation of the equation space by training it on a large corpus of equations in an unsupervised manner. Instead of directly searching the equation space, we employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore this learned latent space. We show that the encoder-decoder architecture of Graph-Eq is able to accurately reconstruct input equations. Moreover, we show that the learned latent representation can be sampled and decoded into valid equations, including new and previously unseen equations in the training data. Finally, we assess Graph-Eq's ability to discover equations that best fit a dataset by exploring the latent space using Bayesian optimization. Latent space exploration is done on 20 dataset with known ground-truth equations, and Graph-Eq is shown to successfully discover the grountruth equation in the majority of datasets.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Krait: A Backdoor Attack Against Graph Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13068v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph prompt tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm to effectively transfer general graph knowledge from pre-trained models to various downstream tasks, particularly in few-shot contexts. However, its susceptibility to backdoor attacks, where adversaries insert triggers to manipulate outcomes, raises a critical concern. We conduct the first study to investigate such vulnerability, revealing that backdoors can disguise benign graph prompts, thus evading detection. We introduce Krait, a novel graph prompt backdoor. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic metric called label non-uniformity homophily to select poisoned candidates, significantly reducing computational complexity. To accommodate diverse attack scenarios and advanced attack types, we design three customizable trigger generation methods to craft prompts as triggers. We propose a novel centroid similarity-based loss function to optimize prompt tuning for attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Experiments on four real-world graphs demonstrate that Krait can efficiently embed triggers to merely 0.15% to 2% of training nodes, achieving high attack success rates without sacrificing clean accuracy. Notably, in one-to-one and all-to-one attacks, Krait can achieve 100% attack success rates by poisoning as few as 2 and 22 nodes, respectively. Our experiments further show that Krait remains potent across different transfer cases, attack types, and graph neural network backbones. Additionally, Krait can be successfully extended to the black-box setting, posing more severe threats. Finally, we analyze why Krait can evade both classical and state-of-the-art defenses, and provide practical insights for detecting and mitigating this class of attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SaTML'2025</p></details> |

Integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can enhance reasoning; however, existing methods typically demand costly fine-tuning or retrieve noisy KG information. Recent approaches leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate KG-based input embedding prefixes as soft prompts for LLMs but fail to account for question relevance, resulting in noisy prompts. Moreover, in MCQA tasks, the absence of relevant KG knowledge for certain answer options remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting (QAP), which incorporates question embeddings into GNN aggregation to dynamically assess KG relevance. QAP employs global attention to capture inter-option relationships, enriching soft prompts with inferred knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that QAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, the field lacks a standardized workflow that encompasses prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, ML interpretability, and polymer synthesizability. In this study, we introduce POINT$^{2}$ (POlymer INformatics Training and Testing), a comprehensive benchmark database and protocol designed to address these critical challenges. Leveraging the existing labeled datasets and the unlabeled PI1M dataset, a collection of approximately one million virtual polymers generated via a recurrent neural network trained on the realistic polymers, we develop an ensemble of ML models, including Quantile Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptrons with dropout, Graph Neural Networks, and pretrained large language models. These models are coupled with diverse polymer representations such as Morgan, MACCS, RDKit, Topological, Atom Pair fingerprints, and graph-based descriptors to achieve property predictions, uncertainty estimations, model interpretability, and template-based polymerization synthesizability across a spectrum of properties, including gas permeability, thermal conductivity, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, fractional free volume, and density. The POINT$^{2}$ database can serve as a valuable resource for the polymer informatics community for polymer discovery and optimization.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art approach for many high-impact, real-world graph applications. For feature-rich graphs, a prevalent practice involves utilizing a PM directly to generate features, without incorporating any domain adaptation techniques. Nevertheless, this practice is suboptimal because the node features extracted from PM are graph-agnostic and prevent GNNs from fully utilizing the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features, leading to a decline in GNNs performance. In this work, we seek to improve the node features obtained from a PM for downstream graph tasks and introduce TOUCHUP-G, which has several advantages. It is (a) General: applicable to any downstream graph task, including link prediction which is often employed in recommender systems; (b) Multi-modal: able to improve raw features of any modality (e.g. images, texts, audio); (c) Principled: it is closely related to a novel metric, feature homophily, which we propose to quantify the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features and we show that TOUCHUP-G can effectively shrink the discrepancy between the graph structure and node features; (d) Effective: achieving state-of-the-art results on four real-world datasets spanning different tasks and modalities.</p></details> | SIGIR 2024 |

The objective is to find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while simultaneously minimizing the costs associated with the experts. Different definitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and algorithmic solutions. We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that captures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task coverage and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation variants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution methods. We show that solutions based on the QUBO formulations of TeamFormation problems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines. Furthermore, we show that QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks can effectively learn representations of experts and skills to enable transfer learning, allowing node embeddings from one problem instance to be efficiently applied to another.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, it is critical to develop predictive models that can support clinicians to determine whether or not a patient will return to the hospital in a relatively short period of time (e.g, 30-days). Nowadays, it is possible to collect both structured (electronic health records - EHR) and unstructured information (clinical notes) about a patient hospital event, all potentially containing relevant information for a predictive model. However, their integration is challenging. In this work we explore the combination of clinical notes and EHRs to predict 30-day hospital readmissions. We address the representation of the various types of information available in the EHR data, as well as exploring LLMs to characterize the clinical notes. We collect both information sources as the nodes of a graph neural network (GNN). Our model achieves an AUROC of 0.72 and a balanced accuracy of 66.7\%, highlighting the importance of combining the multimodal information.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADAGE: Active Defenses Against GNN Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00065v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance in various real-world applications, such as drug discovery, traffic states prediction, and recommendation systems. The fact that building powerful GNNs requires a large amount of training data, powerful computing resources, and human expertise turns the models into lucrative targets for model stealing attacks. Prior work has revealed that the threat vector of stealing attacks against GNNs is large and diverse, as an attacker can leverage various heterogeneous signals ranging from node labels to high-dimensional node embeddings to create a local copy of the target GNN at a fraction of the original training costs. This diversity in the threat vector renders the design of effective and general defenses challenging and existing defenses usually focus on one particular stealing setup. Additionally, they solely provide means to identify stolen model copies rather than preventing the attack. To close this gap, we propose the first and general Active Defense Against GNN Extraction (ADAGE). By analyzing the queries to the GNN, tracking their diversity in terms of proximity to different communities identified in the underlying graph, and increasing the defense strength with the growing fraction of communities that have been queried, ADAGE can prevent stealing in all common attack setups. Our extensive experimental evaluation using six benchmark datasets, four GNN models, and three types of adaptive attackers shows that ADAGE penalizes attackers to the degree of rendering stealing impossible, whilst not harming predictive performance for legitimate users. ADAGE, thereby, contributes towards securely sharing valuable GNNs in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Not a...</summary><p>Not all authors have given their explicit consent</p></details> |

However, predicting the prognosis of cancer patients can be a challenging task due to tumor heterogeneity and intra-patient variability, and the complexity of analyzing WSIs. These images are extremely large, containing billions of pixels, making direct processing computationally expensive and requiring specialized methods to extract relevant information. Additionally, multiple WSIs from the same patient may capture different tumor regions, some being more informative than others. This raises a fundamental question: Should we use all WSIs to characterize the patient, or should we identify the most representative slide for prognosis? Our work seeks to answer this question by performing a comparison of various strategies for predicting survival at the WSI and patient level. The former treats each WSI as an independent sample, mimicking the strategy adopted in other works, while the latter comprises methods to either aggregate the predictions of the several WSIs or automatically identify the most relevant slide using multiple-instance learning (MIL). Additionally, we evaluate different Graph Neural Networks architectures under these strategies. We conduct our experiments using the MMIST-ccRCC dataset, which comprises patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Our results show that MIL-based selection improves accuracy, suggesting that choosing the most representative slide benefits survival prediction.</p></details> |  |

Recently, graph prompt learning has emerged as a powerful GNN training paradigm, inspired by advances in language and vision foundation models. Here, a GNN is pre-trained on public data and then adapted to sensitive tasks using lightweight graph prompts. However, using prompts from sensitive data poses privacy risks. In this work, we are the first to investigate these practical risks in graph prompts by instantiating a membership inference attack that reveals significant privacy leakage. We also find that the standard privacy method, DP-SGD, fails to provide practical privacy-utility trade-offs in graph prompt learning, likely due to the small number of sensitive data points used to learn the prompts. As a solution, we propose DP-GPL for differentially private graph prompt learning based on the PATE framework, that generates a graph prompt with differential privacy guarantees. Our evaluation across various graph prompt learning methods, GNN architectures, and pre-training strategies demonstrates that our algorithm achieves high utility at strong privacy, effectively mitigating privacy concerns while preserving the powerful capabilities of prompted GNNs as powerful foundation models in the graph domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Not a...</summary><p>Not all authors have given their explicit consent</p></details> |

Certified robustness based on randomized smoothing has emerged as a promising solution, offering provable guarantees that a model's predictions remain stable under adversarial perturbations within a specified range. However, existing methods face a critical trade-off between accuracy and robustness, as achieving stronger robustness requires introducing greater noise into the input graph. This excessive randomization degrades data quality and disrupts prediction consistency, limiting the practical deployment of certifiably robust GNNs in real-world scenarios where both accuracy and robustness are essential. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{AuditVotes}, the first framework to achieve both high clean accuracy and certifiably robust accuracy for GNNs. It integrates randomized smoothing with two key components, \underline{au}gmentation and con\underline{dit}ional smoothing, aiming to improve data quality and prediction consistency. The augmentation, acting as a pre-processing step, de-noises the randomized graph, significantly improving data quality and clean accuracy. The conditional smoothing, serving as a post-processing step, employs a filtering function to selectively count votes, thereby filtering low-quality predictions and improving voting consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AuditVotes significantly enhances clean accuracy, certified robustness, and empirical robustness while maintaining high computational efficiency. Notably, compared to baseline randomized smoothing, AuditVotes improves clean accuracy by $437.1\%$ and certified accuracy by $409.3\%$ when the attacker can arbitrarily insert $20$ edges on the Cora-ML datasets, representing a substantial step toward deploying certifiably robust GNNs in real-world applications.</p></details> | 20 pages |

As opposed to frame-based cameras, the motion-dependent nature of event cameras presents persistent challenges in achieving robust event feature detection and matching. In recent years, learning-based approaches have demonstrated superior robustness over traditional handcrafted methods in feature detection and matching, particularly under aggressive motion and HDR scenarios. In this paper, we propose SuperEIO, a novel framework that leverages the learning-based event-only detection and IMU measurements to achieve event-inertial odometry. Our event-only feature detection employs a convolutional neural network under continuous event streams. Moreover, our system adopts the graph neural network to achieve event descriptor matching for loop closure. The proposed system utilizes TensorRT to accelerate the inference speed of deep networks, which ensures low-latency processing and robust real-time operation on resource-limited platforms. Besides, we evaluate our method extensively on multiple public datasets, demonstrating its superior accuracy and robustness compared to other state-of-the-art event-based methods.

This study introduces the Multi-Omics Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (MOGKAN), a deep learning model that integrates messenger RNA, micro RNA sequences, and DNA methylation data with Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks for accurate and interpretable cancer classification across 31 cancer types. MOGKAN employs a hybrid approach combining differential expression with DESeq2, Linear Models for Microarray (LIMMA), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to reduce multi-omics data dimensionality while preserving relevant biological features. The model architecture is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem principle, using trainable univariate functions to enhance interpretability and feature analysis. MOGKAN achieves classification accuracy of 96.28 percent and demonstrates low experimental variability with a standard deviation that is reduced by 1.58 to 7.30 percents compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The biomarkers identified by MOGKAN have been validated as cancer-related markers through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. The proposed model presents an ability to uncover molecular oncogenesis mechanisms by detecting phosphoinositide-binding substances and regulating sphingolipid cellular processes. By integrating multi-omics data with graph-based deep learning, our proposed approach demonstrates superior predictive performance and interpretability that has the potential to enhance the translation of complex multi-omics data into clinically actionable cancer diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

Global change drivers,including climate change or land use modifications, can alter the plant-pollinator interactions. To assess the potential influence of global change drivers on pollination, large-scale interactions, climate and land use data are required. While recent machine learning methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), allow the analysis of such datasets, interpreting their results can be challenging. We explore existing methods for interpreting GNNs in order to highlight the effects of various environmental covariates on pollination network connectivity. A large simulation study is performed to confirm whether these methods can detect the interactive effect between a covariate and a genus of plant on connectivity, and whether the application of debiasing techniques influences the estimation of these effects. An application on the Spipoll dataset, with and without accounting for sampling effects, highlights the potential impact of land use on network connectivity and shows that accounting for sampling effects partially alters the estimation of these effects.</p></details> |  |

Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |

We present a comparative analysis of three distinct methods for bias mitigation: data sparsification, feature modification, and synthetic data augmentation. Through experimental analysis using the german credit dataset, we evaluate these approaches using multiple fairness metrics, including statistical parity, equality of opportunity, and false positive rates. Our research demonstrates that while all methods improve fairness metrics compared to the original dataset, stratified sampling and synthetic data augmentation using GraphSAGE prove particularly effective in balancing demographic representation while maintaining model performance. The results provide practical insights for developing more equitable AI systems while maintaining model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Data Selection for Training Genomic Perturbation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14571v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based PerturbSeq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene expression models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Active learning methods are often employed to train these models due to the cost of the genomic experiments required to build the training set. However, poor model initialization in active learning can result in suboptimal early selections, wasting time and valuable resources. While typical active learning mitigates this issue over many iterations, the limited number of experimental cycles in genomic studies exacerbates the risk. To this end, we propose graph-based one-shot data selection methods for training gene expression models. Unlike active learning, one-shot data selection predefines the gene perturbations before training, hence removing the initialization bias. The data selection is motivated by theoretical studies of graph neural network generalization. The criteria are defined over the input graph and are optimized with submodular maximization. We compare them empirically to baselines and active learning methods that are state-of-the-art on this problem. The results demonstrate that graph-based one-shot data selection achieves comparable accuracy while alleviating the aforementioned risks.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Understanding and measuring these elements provides valuable insights into therapeutic processes and outcomes. However, automatic identification of these change principles from textual data remains challenging due to the nuanced and context-dependent nature of therapeutic dialogue. This paper introduces CFiCS, a hierarchical classification framework integrating graph machine learning with pretrained contextual embeddings. We represent common factors, intervention concepts, and microcounseling skills as a heterogeneous graph, where textual information from ClinicalBERT enriches each node. This structure captures both the hierarchical relationships (e.g., skill-level nodes linking to broad factors) and the semantic properties of therapeutic concepts. By leveraging graph neural networks, CFiCS learns inductive node embeddings that generalize to unseen text samples lacking explicit connections. Our results demonstrate that integrating ClinicalBERT node features and graph structure significantly improves classification performance, especially in fine-grained skill prediction. CFiCS achieves substantial gains in both micro and macro F1 scores across all tasks compared to baselines, including random forests, BERT-based multi-task models, and graph-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Invariant Control Strategies for Active Flow Control using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22775v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has gained traction for active flow control tasks, with initial applications exploring drag mitigation via flow field augmentation around a two-dimensional cylinder. RL has since been extended to more complex turbulent flows and has shown significant potential in learning complex control strategies. However, such applications remain computationally challenging due to its sample inefficiency and associated simulation costs. This fact is worsened by the lack of generalization capabilities of these trained policy networks, often being implicitly tied to the input configurations of their training conditions. In this work, we propose the use of graph neural networks to address this particular limitation, effectively increasing the range of applicability and getting more value out of the upfront RL training cost. GNNs can naturally process unstructured, threedimensional flow data, preserving spatial relationships without the constraints of a Cartesian grid. Additionally, they incorporate rotational, reflectional, and permutation invariance into the learned control policies, thus improving generalization and thereby removing the shortcomings of commonly used CNN or MLP architectures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we revisit the well-established two-dimensional cylinder benchmark problem for active flow control. The RL training is implemented using Relexi, a high-performance RL framework, with flow simulations conducted in parallel using the high-order discontinuous Galerkin framework FLEXI. Our results show that GNN-based control policies achieve comparable performance to existing methods while benefiting from improved generalization properties. This work establishes GNNs as a promising architecture for RL-based flow control and highlights the capabilities of Relexi and FLEXI for large-scale RL applications in fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven modeling of fluid flow around rotating structures with graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22252v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks, recently introduced into the field of fluid flow surrogate modeling, have been successfully applied to model the temporal evolution of various fluid flow systems. Existing applications, however, are mostly restricted to cases where the domain is time-invariant. The present work extends the application of graph neural network-based modeling to fluid flow around structures rotating with respect to a certain axis. Specifically, we propose to apply a graph neural network-based surrogate modeling for fluid flow with the mesh corotating with the structure. Unlike conventional data-driven approaches that rely on structured Cartesian meshes, our framework operates on unstructured co-rotating meshes, enforcing rotation equivariance of the learned model by leveraging co-rotating polar (2D) and cylindrical (3D) coordinate systems. To model the pressure for systems without Dirichlet pressure boundaries, we propose a novel local directed pressure difference formulation that is invariant to the reference pressure point and value. For flow systems with large mesh sizes, we introduce a scheme to train the network in single or distributed graphics processing units by accumulating the backpropagated gradients from partitions of the mesh. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is examined on two test cases: (i) fluid flow in a 2D rotating mixer, and (ii) the flow past a 3D rotating cube. Our results show that the model achieves stable and accurate rollouts for over 2000 time steps in periodic regimes while capturing accurate short-term dynamics in chaotic flow regimes. In addition, the drag and lift force predictions closely match the CFD calculations, highlighting the potential of the framework for modeling both periodic and chaotic fluid flow around rotating structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Social Dynamical System for Twitter Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19316v3)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the evolution of public opinion is crucial for informed decision-making in various domains, particularly public affairs. The rapid growth of social networks, such as Twitter (now rebranded as X), provides an unprecedented opportunity to analyze public opinion at scale without relying on traditional surveys. With the rise of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in modeling online opinion dynamics. Notably, classical opinion dynamics models, such as DeGroot, can be reformulated within a GNN framework. We introduce Latent Social Dynamical System (LSDS), a novel framework for modeling the latent dynamics of social media users' opinions based on textual content. Since expressed opinions may not fully reflect underlying beliefs, LSDS first encodes post content into latent representations. It then leverages a GraphODE framework, using a GNN-based ODE function to predict future opinions. A decoder subsequently utilizes these predicted latent opinions to perform downstream tasks, such as interaction prediction, which serve as benchmarks for model evaluation. Our framework is highly flexible, supporting various opinion dynamic models as ODE functions, provided they can be adapted into a GNN-based form. It also accommodates different encoder architectures and is compatible with diverse downstream tasks. To validate our approach, we constructed dynamic datasets from Twitter data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LSDS, highlighting its potential for future applications. We plan to publicly release our dataset and code upon the publication of this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>will ...</summary><p>will be submitted to a journal soon</p></details> |
| **[Few-Shot Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22097v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods for graph out-of-distribution (OOD) detection typically depend on training graph neural network (GNN) classifiers using a substantial amount of labeled in-distribution (ID) data. However, acquiring high-quality labeled nodes in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) is challenging and costly due to their complex textual and structural characteristics. Large language models (LLMs), known for their powerful zero-shot capabilities in textual tasks, show promise but struggle to naturally capture the critical structural information inherent to TAGs, limiting their direct effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-GOOD, a general framework that effectively combines the strengths of LLMs and GNNs to enhance data efficiency in graph OOD detection. Specifically, we first leverage LLMs' strong zero-shot capabilities to filter out likely OOD nodes, significantly reducing the human annotation burden. To minimize the usage and cost of the LLM, we employ it only to annotate a small subset of unlabeled nodes. We then train a lightweight GNN filter using these noisy labels, enabling efficient predictions of ID status for all other unlabeled nodes by leveraging both textual and structural information. After obtaining node embeddings from the GNN filter, we can apply informativeness-based methods to select the most valuable nodes for precise human annotation. Finally, we train the target ID classifier using these accurately annotated ID nodes. Extensive experiments on four real-world TAG datasets demonstrate that LLM-GOOD significantly reduces human annotation costs and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both ID classification accuracy and OOD detection performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension by Integrating Multimodal Data with a Hybrid Graph Convolutional and Transformer Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01025v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early and accurate diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is essential for optimal patient management. Differentiating between pre-capillary and post-capillary PH is critical for guiding treatment decisions. This study develops and validates a deep learning-based diagnostic model for PH, designed to classify patients as non-PH, pre-capillary PH, or post-capillary PH. This retrospective study analyzed data from 204 patients (112 with pre-capillary PH, 32 with post-capillary PH, and 60 non-PH controls) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. Diagnoses were confirmed through right heart catheterization. We selected 6 samples from each category for the test set (18 samples, 10%), with the remaining 186 samples used for the training set. This process was repeated 35 times for testing. This paper proposes a deep learning model that combines Graph convolutional networks (GCN), Convolutional neural networks (CNN), and Transformers. The model was developed to process multimodal data, including short-axis (SAX) sequences, four-chamber (4CH) sequences, and clinical parameters. Our model achieved a performance of Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.81 +- 0.06(standard deviation) and Accuracy (ACC) = 0.73 +- 0.06 on the test set. The discriminative abilities were as follows: non-PH subjects (AUC = 0.74 +- 0.11), pre-capillary PH (AUC = 0.86 +- 0.06), and post-capillary PH (AUC = 0.83 +- 0.10). It has the potential to support clinical decision-making by effectively integrating multimodal data to assist physicians in making accurate and timely diagnoses.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph Sampling for Scalable and Expressive Graph Neural Networks on Homophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16593v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in many graph machine learning tasks but face challenges when scaling to large networks. GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian trace -- a proxy for the graph connectivity -- than random sampling, while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving Laplacian trace and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Equivariant Networks with Probabilistic Symmetry Breaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21985v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariance encodes known symmetries into neural networks, often enhancing generalization. However, equivariant networks cannot break symmetries: the output of an equivariant network must, by definition, have at least the same self-symmetries as the input. This poses an important problem, both (1) for prediction tasks on domains where self-symmetries are common, and (2) for generative models, which must break symmetries in order to reconstruct from highly symmetric latent spaces. This fundamental limitation can be addressed by considering equivariant conditional distributions, instead of equivariant functions. We present novel theoretical results that establish necessary and sufficient conditions for representing such distributions. Concretely, this representation provides a practical framework for breaking symmetries in any equivariant network via randomized canonicalization. Our method, SymPE (Symmetry-breaking Positional Encodings), admits a simple interpretation in terms of positional encodings. This approach expands the representational power of equivariant networks while retaining the inductive bias of symmetry, which we justify through generalization bounds. Experimental results demonstrate that SymPE significantly improves performance of group-equivariant and graph neural networks across diffusion models for graphs, graph autoencoders, and lattice spin system modeling.</p></details> | 28 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Geometric Flow Models over Neural Network Weights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03710v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models such as flow and diffusion models have proven to be effective in modeling high-dimensional and complex data types such as videos or proteins, and this has motivated their use in different data modalities, such as neural network weights. A generative model of neural network weights would be useful for a diverse set of applications, such as Bayesian deep learning, learned optimization, and transfer learning. However, the existing work on weight-space generative models often ignores the symmetries of neural network weights, or only takes into account a subset of them. Modeling those symmetries, such as permutation symmetries between subsequent layers in an MLP, the filters in a convolutional network, or scaling symmetries arising with the use of non-linear activations, holds the potential to make weight-space generative modeling more efficient by effectively reducing the dimensionality of the problem. In this light, we aim to design generative models in weight-space that more comprehensively respect the symmetries of neural network weights. We build on recent work on generative modeling with flow matching, and weight-space graph neural networks to design three different weight-space flows. Each of our flows takes a different approach to modeling the geometry of neural network weights, and thus allows us to explore the design space of weight-space flows in a principled way. Our results confirm that modeling the geometry of neural networks more faithfully leads to more effective flow models that can generalize to different tasks and architectures, and we show that while our flows obtain competitive performance with orders of magnitude fewer parameters than previous work, they can be further improved by scaling them up. We conclude by listing potential directions for future work on weight-space generative models.</p></details> | MSc Thesis |
| **[A Comprehensive Benchmark for RNA 3D Structure-Function Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21681v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The RNA structure-function relationship has recently garnered significant attention within the deep learning community, promising to grow in importance as nucleic acid structure models advance. However, the absence of standardized and accessible benchmarks for deep learning on RNA 3D structures has impeded the development of models for RNA functional characteristics. In this work, we introduce a set of seven benchmarking datasets for RNA structure-function prediction, designed to address this gap. Our library builds on the established Python library rnaglib, and offers easy data distribution and encoding, splitters and evaluation methods, providing a convenient all-in-one framework for comparing models. Datasets are implemented in a fully modular and reproducible manner, facilitating for community contributions and customization. Finally, we provide initial baseline results for all tasks using a graph neural network. Source code: https://github.com/cgoliver/rnaglib Documentation: https://rnaglib.org</p></details> |  |
| **[GNNMerge: Merging of GNN Models Without Accessing Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03384v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging has gained prominence in machine learning as a method to integrate multiple trained models into a single model without accessing the original training data. While existing approaches have demonstrated success in domains such as computer vision and NLP, their application to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) remains unexplored. These methods often rely on the assumption of shared initialization, which is seldom applicable to GNNs. In this work, we undertake the first benchmarking study of model merging algorithms for GNNs, revealing their limited effectiveness in this context. To address these challenges, we propose GNNMerge, which utilizes a task-agnostic node embedding alignment strategy to merge GNNs. Furthermore, we establish that under a mild relaxation, the proposed optimization objective admits direct analytical solutions for widely used GNN architectures, significantly enhancing its computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations across diverse datasets, tasks, and architectures establish GNNMerge to be up to 24% more accurate than existing methods while delivering over 2 orders of magnitude speed-up compared to training from scratch.</p></details> |  |

To that end, we align the weights of different models layer-wise using optimal transport (OT). We present and evaluate three types of transportation costs and show that the studied fusion method consistently outperforms the performance of vanilla averaging. Finally, we present results suggesting that model fusion using OT is harder in the case of GCNs than MLPs and that incorporating the graph structure into the process does not improve the performance of the method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Cut-informed Graph Embedding and Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06635v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph clustering aims to divide the graph into different clusters. The recently emerging deep graph clustering approaches are largely built on graph neural networks (GNN). However, GNN is designed for general graph encoding and there is a common issue of representation collapse in existing GNN-based deep graph clustering algorithms. We attribute two main reasons for such issues: (i) the inductive bias of GNN models: GNNs tend to generate similar representations for proximal nodes. Since graphs often contain a non-negligible amount of inter-cluster links, the bias results in error message passing and leads to biased clustering; (ii) the clustering guided loss function: most traditional approaches strive to make all samples closer to pre-learned cluster centers, which causes a degenerate solution assigning all data points to a single label thus make all samples and less discriminative. To address these challenges, we investigate graph clustering from a graph cut perspective and propose an innovative and non-GNN-based Deep Cut-informed Graph embedding and Clustering framework, namely DCGC. This framework includes two modules: (i) cut-informed graph encoding; (ii) self-supervised graph clustering via optimal transport. For the encoding module, we derive a cut-informed graph embedding objective to fuse graph structure and attributes by minimizing their joint normalized cut. For the clustering module, we utilize the optimal transport theory to obtain the clustering assignments, which can balance the guidance of "proximity to the pre-learned cluster center". With the above two tailored designs, DCGC is more suitable for the graph clustering task, which can effectively alleviate the problem of representation collapse and achieve better performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method is simple but effective compared with benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CombiGCN: An effective GCN model for Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21471v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have opened up a potential line of research for collaborative filtering (CF). The key power of GNNs is based on injecting collaborative signal into user and item embeddings which will contain information about user-item interactions after that. However, there are still some unsatisfactory points for a CF model that GNNs could have done better. The way in which the collaborative signal are extracted through an implicit feedback matrix that is essentially built on top of the message-passing architecture of GNNs, and it only helps to update the embedding based on the value of the items (or users) embeddings neighboring. By identifying the similarity weight of users through their interaction history, a key concept of CF, we endeavor to build a user-user weighted connection graph based on their similarity weight. In this study, we propose a recommendation framework, CombiGCN, in which item embeddings are only linearly propagated on the user-item interaction graph, while user embeddings are propagated simultaneously on both the user-user weighted connection graph and user-item interaction graph graphs with Light Graph Convolution (LGC) and combined in a simpler method by using the weighted sum of the embeddings for each layer. We also conducted experiments comparing CombiGCN with several state-of-the-art models on three real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improvement Graph Convolution Collaborative Filtering with Weighted addition input](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21468v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks have been extensively applied in the field of machine learning to find features of graphs, and recommendation systems are no exception. The ratings of users on considered items can be represented by graphs which are input for many efficient models to find out the characteristics of the users and the items. From these insights, relevant items are recommended to users. However, user's decisions on the items have varying degrees of effects on different users, and this information should be learned so as not to be lost in the process of information mining. In this publication, we propose to build an additional graph showing the recommended weight of an item to a target user to improve the accuracy of GNN models. Although the users' friendships were not recorded, their correlation was still evident through the commonalities in consumption behavior. We build a model WiGCN (Weighted input GCN) to describe and experiment on well-known datasets. Conclusions will be stated after comparing our results with state-of-the-art such as GCMC, NGCF and LightGCN.

| **[Graph-to-Vision: Multi-graph Understanding and Reasoning using Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21435v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), as the dominant paradigm for graph-structured learning, have long faced dual challenges of exponentially escalating computational complexity and inadequate cross-scenario generalization capability. With the rapid advancement of multimodal learning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional cross-modal relational reasoning capabilities and generalization capacities, thereby opening up novel pathways for overcoming the inherent limitations of conventional graph learning paradigms. However, current research predominantly concentrates on investigating the single-graph reasoning capabilities of VLMs, which fundamentally fails to address the critical requirement for coordinated reasoning across multiple heterogeneous graph data in real-world application scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose the first multi-graph joint reasoning benchmark for VLMs. Our benchmark encompasses four graph categories: knowledge graphs, flowcharts, mind maps, and route maps,with each graph group accompanied by three progressively challenging instruction-response pairs. Leveraging this benchmark, we conducted comprehensive capability assessments of state-of-the-art VLMs and performed fine-tuning on open-source models. This study not only addresses the underexplored evaluation gap in multi-graph reasoning for VLMs but also empirically validates their generalization superiority in graph-structured learning.</p></details> |  |

We also show that the satisfiability problem is PSPACE-complete. These results bring together the promise of using standard logical methods for reasoning about GNNs and their properties, particularly in applications such as GNN querying, equivalence checking, etc. We prove that such natural problems can be solved in polynomial space.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2307.05150</p></details> |

However, traditional link-level volume estimation models are effective for motorized traffic but face significant challenges when applied to the bicycling context because of sparse data and the intricate nature of bicycling mobility patterns. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first study to utilize a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) architecture to model link-level bicycling volumes and systematically investigate the impact of varying levels of data sparsity (0%--99%) on model performance, simulating real-world scenarios. We have leveraged Strava Metro data as the primary source of bicycling counts across 15,933 road segments/links in the City of Melbourne, Australia. To evaluate the effectiveness of the GCN model, we benchmark it against traditional machine learning models, such as linear regression, support vector machines, and random forest. Our results show that the GCN model outperforms these traditional models in predicting Annual Average Daily Bicycle (AADB) counts, demonstrating its ability to capture the spatial dependencies inherent in bicycle traffic networks. While GCN remains robust up to 80% sparsity, its performance declines sharply beyond this threshold, highlighting the challenges of extreme data sparsity. These findings underscore the potential of GCNs in enhancing bicycling volume estimation, while also emphasizing the need for further research on methods to improve model resilience under high-sparsity conditions. Our findings offer valuable insights for city planners aiming to improve bicycling infrastructure and promote sustainable transportation.</p></details> |  |

Graph classification is a pivotal task in data mining with applications in social network analysis, web analysis, drug discovery, molecular property prediction, etc. Graph neural networks have achieved the state-of-the-art performance in graph classification, but they consistently struggle with overfitting. To mitigate overfitting, researchers have introduced various representation learning methods utilizing graph augmentation. However, existing methods rely on simplistic use of graph augmentation, which loses augmentation-induced differences and limits the expressiveness of representations. In this paper, we propose AugWard (Augmentation-Aware Training with Graph Distance and Consistency Regularization), a novel graph representation learning framework that carefully considers the diversity introduced by graph augmentation. AugWard applies augmentation-aware training to predict the graph distance between the augmented graph and its original one, aligning the representation difference directly with graph distance at both feature and structure levels. Furthermore, AugWard employs consistency regularization to encourage the classifier to handle richer representations. Experimental results show that AugWard gives the state-of-the-art performance in supervised, semi-supervised graph classification, and transfer learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PAKDD 2025 (Oral Presentation)</p></details> |

Most traditional multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) detection and tracking methods rely on 2D object detection, single-view multi-object tracking (MOT), and cross-view re-identification (ReID) techniques, without properly handling important 3D information by multi-view image aggregation. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection and tracking framework, named MCBLT, which first aggregates multi-view images with necessary camera calibration parameters to obtain 3D object detections in bird's-eye view (BEV). Then, we introduce hierarchical graph neural networks (GNNs) to track these 3D detections in BEV for MTMC tracking results. Unlike existing methods, MCBLT has impressive generalizability across different scenes and diverse camera settings, with exceptional capability for long-term association handling. As a result, our proposed MCBLT establishes a new state-of-the-art on the AICity'24 dataset with $81.22$ HOTA, and on the WildTrack dataset with $95.6$ IDF1.</p></details> |  |

This challenge becomes even more pronounced when attempting to generalize to structures that were not part of the training data.. In this work, we introduce SymGNN, a graph neural network architecture that leverages material symmetries to improve adsorption property prediction. By incorporating symmetry operations into the message-passing mechanism, our model enhances parameter sharing across different zeolite topologies, leading to improved generalization. We evaluate SymGNN on both interpolation and generalization tasks, demonstrating that it successfully captures key adsorption trends, including the influence of both the framework and aluminium distribution on CO$_2$ adsorption. Furthermore, we apply our model to the characterization of experimental adsorption isotherms, using a genetic algorithm to infer likely aluminium distributions. Our results highlight the effectiveness of machine learning models trained on simulations for studying real materials and suggest promising directions for fine-tuning with experimental data and generative approaches for the inverse design of multifunctional nanomaterials.</p></details> |  |

We also introduce a recursive algorithm for general sparse grid-based detectors, characterized by convergence properties and easy applicability. Numerical experiments on functions with dimensions n = 2 and n = 4 demonstrate the efficiency and robust generalization properties of GINNs in detecting discontinuity interfaces. Notably, the trained GINNs offer portability and versatility, allowing integration into various algorithms and sharing among users.</p></details> |  |

However, their vulnerability to network perturbations poses a significant challenge. We propose $\beta$-GNN, a model enhancing GNN robustness without sacrificing clean data performance. $\beta$-GNN uses a weighted ensemble, combining any GNN with a multi-layer perceptron. A learned dynamic weight, $\beta$, modulates the GNN's contribution. This $\beta$ not only weights GNN influence but also indicates data perturbation levels, enabling proactive mitigation. Experimental results on diverse datasets show $\beta$-GNN's superior adversarial accuracy and attack severity quantification. Crucially, $\beta$-GNN avoids perturbation assumptions, preserving clean data structure and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the paper accepted at EuroMLSys 2025</p></details> |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools allowing for different kinds of prediction and inference on these systems, but getting a handle on uncertainty, especially in dynamic settings, is a challenging problem. In this work we propose to use a dynamic graph representation known in the tensor literature as the unfolding, to achieve valid prediction sets via conformal prediction. This representation, a simple graph, can be input to any standard GNN and does not require any modification to existing GNN architectures or conformal prediction routines. One of our key contributions is a careful mathematical consideration of the different inference scenarios which can arise in a dynamic graph modelling context. For a range of practically relevant cases, we obtain valid prediction sets with almost no assumptions, even dispensing with exchangeability. In a more challenging scenario, which we call the semi-inductive regime, we achieve valid prediction under stronger assumptions, akin to stationarity. We provide real data examples demonstrating validity, showing improved accuracy over baselines, and sign-posting different failure modes which can occur when those assumptions are violated.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

However, training on such data requires large memory and extensive computations. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for efficient multiscale training of GNNs, designed to integrate information across multiscale representations of a graph. Our approach leverages a hierarchical graph representation, taking advantage of coarse graph scales in the training process, where each coarse scale graph has fewer nodes and edges. Based on this approach, we propose a suite of GNN training methods: such as coarse-to-fine, sub-to-full, and multiscale gradient computation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on various datasets and learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, comparing gene expression profiles between disease and control patients can deepen the understanding of disease pathology. Therefore, machine learning has been used to process gene expression data, with patient diagnosis emerging as one of the most popular applications. Although gene expression data can provide valuable insights, challenges arise because the number of patients in expression datasets is usually limited, and the data from different datasets with different gene expressions cannot be easily combined. This work proposes a novel methodology to address these challenges by integrating multiple gene expression datasets and domain-specific knowledge using knowledge graphs, a unique tool for biomedical data integration. Then, vector representations are produced using knowledge graph embedding techniques, which are used as inputs for a graph neural network and a multi-layer perceptron. We evaluate the efficacy of our methodology in three settings: single-dataset learning, multi-dataset learning, and transfer learning. The experimental results show that combining gene expression datasets and domain-specific knowledge improves patient diagnosis in all three settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Extended Semantic Web Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Graph-Level Label-Only Membership Inference Attack against Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19070v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for graph-structured data but are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs) in graph classification tasks, which determine if a graph was part of the training dataset, potentially causing data leakage. Existing MIAs rely on prediction probability vectors, but they become ineffective when only prediction labels are available. We propose a Graph-level Label-Only Membership Inference Attack (GLO-MIA), which is based on the intuition that the target model's predictions on training data are more stable than those on testing data. GLO-MIA generates a set of perturbed graphs for target graph by adding perturbations to its effective features and queries the target model with the perturbed graphs to get their prediction labels, which are then used to calculate robustness score of the target graph. Finally, by comparing the robustness score with a predefined threshold, the membership of the target graph can be inferred correctly with high probability. Our evaluation on three datasets and four GNN models shows that GLO-MIA achieves an attack accuracy of up to 0.825, outperforming baseline work by 8.5% and closely matching the performance of probability-based MIAs, even with only prediction labels.</p></details> |  |
| **[BeLightRec: A lightweight recommender system enhanced with BERT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20206v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The trend of data mining using deep learning models on graph neural networks has proven effective in identifying object features through signal encoders and decoders, particularly in recommendation systems utilizing collaborative filtering methods. Collaborative filtering exploits similarities between users and items from historical data. However, it overlooks distinctive information, such as item names and descriptions. The semantic data of items should be further mined using models in the natural language processing field. Thus, items can be compared using text classification, similarity assessments, or identifying analogous sentence pairs. This research proposes combining two sources of item similarity signals: one from collaborative filtering and one from the semantic similarity measure between item names and descriptions.

Prior global placement methods optimize each circuit design individually from scratch. Their neglect of transferable knowledge limits solution efficiency and chip performance as circuit complexity drastically increases. This study presents TransPlace, a global placement framework that learns to place millions of mixed-size cells in continuous space. TransPlace introduces i) Netlist Graph to efficiently model netlist topology, ii) Cell-flow and relative position encoding to learn SE(2)-invariant representation, iii) a tailored graph neural network architecture for informed parameterization of placement knowledge, and iv) a two-stage strategy for coarse-to-fine placement. Compared to state-of-the-art placement methods, TransPlace-trained on a few high-quality placements-can place unseen circuits with 1.2x speedup while reducing congestion by 30%, timing by 9%, and wirelength by 5%.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD 2025 |

Conventional forecasting methods often neglect the power grid's inherent topology, limiting their ability to capture complex spatio temporal dependencies. This paper proposes a topology aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for predicting power system states under high renewable integration. We construct a graph based representation of the power network, modeling buses and transmission lines as nodes and edges, and introduce a specialized GNN architecture that integrates GraphSAGE convolutions with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model both spatial and temporal correlations in system dynamics. The model is trained and evaluated on the NREL 118 test system using realistic, time synchronous renewable generation profiles. Our results show that the proposed GNN outperforms baseline approaches including fully connected neural networks, linear regression, and rolling mean models, achieving substantial improvements in predictive accuracy. The GNN achieves average RMSEs of 0.13 to 0.17 across all predicted variables and demonstrates consistent performance across spatial locations and operational conditions. These results highlight the potential of topology aware learning for scalable and robust power system forecasting in future grids with high renewable penetration.</p></details> |  |

The effectiveness of such peer-based interventions relies on accurate network data regarding individual attributes and social influences. However, these datasets are often collected through self-reported surveys, introducing ambiguities in network construction. These ambiguities make it challenging to fully utilize the network data to understand the issues and to design the best interventions. We propose and solve two variations of link ambiguities in such network data -- (i) which among the two candidate links exists, and (ii) if a candidate link exists. We design a Graph Attention Network (GAT) that accounts for personal attributes and network relationships on real-world data with real and simulated ambiguities. We also demonstrate that by resolving these ambiguities, we improve network accuracy, and in turn, improve suicide risk prediction. We also uncover patterns using GNNExplainer to provide additional insights into vital features and relationships. This research demonstrates the potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to advance real-world network data analysis facilitating more effective peer interventions across various fields.</p></details> |  |

However, directly repurposing the generative denoising process for discriminative objectives reveals critical gaps rarely addressed previously. Generative models tolerate intermediate sampling errors if the final distribution remains plausible, but discriminative tasks require rigorous accuracy throughout, as evidenced in challenging multi-modal tasks like referring image segmentation. Motivated by this gap, we analyze and enhance alignment between generative diffusion processes and perception tasks, focusing on how perception quality evolves during denoising. We find: (1) earlier denoising steps contribute disproportionately to perception quality, prompting us to propose tailored learning objectives reflecting varying timestep contributions; (2) later denoising steps show unexpected perception degradation, highlighting sensitivity to training-denoising distribution shifts, addressed by our diffusion-tailored data augmentation; and (3) generative processes uniquely enable interactivity, serving as controllable user interfaces adaptable to correctional prompts in multi-round interactions. Our insights significantly improve diffusion-based perception models without architectural changes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on depth estimation, referring image segmentation, and generalist perception tasks.

In this context, we obtain Arnold diffusion in terms of a transfer of energy, in an amount independent of the perturbation parameter, between the Kepler problem and the restricted three-body problem. Our argument is based on a topological method based on correctly aligned windows which is implemented into a computer assisted proof. This approach can be applied to physically relevant masses of the bodies, such as those in a Neptune-Triton-asteroid system. In this case, we obtain explicit estimates for the range of the perturbation parameter and for the diffusion time.</p></details> | 41 pages, 7 figures |

Score distillation accelerates diffusion sampling but with performance degradation, while post-training with direct policy optimization (DPO) boosts performance using preference data. This paper proposes Distillation-DPO, a novel diffusion distillation framework for LiDAR scene completion with preference aligment. First, the student model generates paired completion scenes with different initial noises. Second, using LiDAR scene evaluation metrics as preference, we construct winning and losing sample pairs. Such construction is reasonable, since most LiDAR scene metrics are informative but non-differentiable to be optimized directly. Third, Distillation-DPO optimizes the student model by exploiting the difference in score functions between the teacher and student models on the paired completion scenes. Such procedure is repeated until convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art LiDAR scene completion diffusion models, Distillation-DPO achieves higher-quality scene completion while accelerating the completion speed by more than 5-fold. Our method is the first to explore adopting preference learning in distillation to the best of our knowledge and provide insights into preference-aligned distillation.

Recent advancements in GANs include 3D-aware models such as EG3D, which feature efficient triplane-based architectures capable of reconstructing 3D geometry from single images. However, limited attention has been given to providing an integrated framework for 3D-aware, high-quality, reference-based image editing. This study addresses this gap by exploring and demonstrating the effectiveness of the triplane space for advanced reference-based edits. Our novel approach integrates encoding, automatic localization, spatial disentanglement of triplane features, and fusion learning to achieve the desired edits. We demonstrate how our approach excels across diverse domains, including human faces, 360-degree heads, animal faces, partially stylized edits like cartoon faces, full-body clothing edits, and edits on class-agnostic samples. Our method shows state-of-the-art performance over relevant latent direction, text, and image-guided 2D and 3D-aware diffusion and GAN methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Highlight.

While numerous efforts have been devoted to static image scenarios, ensuring temporal coherence in video-based normal estimation remains a formidable challenge. Instead of merely augmenting existing methods with temporal components, we present NormalCrafter to leverage the inherent temporal priors of video diffusion models. To secure high-fidelity normal estimation across sequences, we propose Semantic Feature Regularization (SFR), which aligns diffusion features with semantic cues, encouraging the model to concentrate on the intrinsic semantics of the scene. Moreover, we introduce a two-stage training protocol that leverages both latent and pixel space learning to preserve spatial accuracy while maintaining long temporal context. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our method, showcasing a superior performance in generating temporally consistent normal sequences with intricate details from diverse videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, Project Page: https://normalcrafter.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[ADT: Tuning Diffusion Models with Adversarial Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11423v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved outstanding image generation by reversing a forward noising process to approximate true data distributions. During training, these models predict diffusion scores from noised versions of true samples in a single forward pass, while inference requires iterative denoising starting from white noise. This training-inference divergences hinder the alignment between inference and training data distributions, due to potential prediction biases and cumulative error accumulation. To address this problem, we propose an intuitive but effective fine-tuning framework, called Adversarial Diffusion Tuning (ADT), by stimulating the inference process during optimization and aligning the final outputs with training data by adversarial supervision. Specifically, to achieve robust adversarial training, ADT features a siamese-network discriminator with a fixed pre-trained backbone and lightweight trainable parameters, incorporates an image-to-image sampling strategy to smooth discriminative difficulties, and preserves the original diffusion loss to prevent discriminator hacking. In addition, we carefully constrain the backward-flowing path for back-propagating gradients along the inference path without incurring memory overload or gradient explosion. Finally, extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion models (v1.5, XL, and v3), demonstrate that ADT significantly improves both distribution alignment and image quality.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce VideoPanda, a novel approach for synthesizing 360$^\circ$ videos conditioned on text or single-view video data. VideoPanda leverages multi-view attention layers to augment a video diffusion model, enabling it to generate consistent multi-view videos that can be combined into immersive panoramic content. VideoPanda is trained jointly using two conditions: text-only and single-view video, and supports autoregressive generation of long-videos. To overcome the computational burden of multi-view video generation, we randomly subsample the duration and camera views used during training and show that the model is able to gracefully generalize to generating more frames during inference. Extensive evaluations on both real-world and synthetic video datasets demonstrate that VideoPanda generates more realistic and coherent 360$^\circ$ panoramas across all input conditions compared to existing methods.

| **[The Pitfalls of Imitation Learning when Actions are Continuous](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09722v3)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a discrete-time, continuous state-and-action control system. We show that, even if the dynamics satisfy a control-theoretic property called exponentially stability (i.e. the effects of perturbations decay exponentially quickly), and the expert is smooth and deterministic, any smooth, deterministic imitator policy necessarily suffers error on execution that is exponentially larger, as a function of problem horizon, than the error under the distribution of expert training data. Our negative result applies to any algorithm which learns solely from expert data, including both behavior cloning and offline-RL algorithms, unless the algorithm produces highly "improper" imitator policies--those which are non-smooth, non-Markovian, or which exhibit highly state-dependent stochasticity--or unless the expert trajectory distribution is sufficiently "spread." We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of these more complex policy parameterizations, explicating the benefits of today's popular policy parameterizations in robot learning (e.g. action-chunking and Diffusion Policies). We also establish a host of complementary negative and positive results for imitation in control systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>98 pa...</summary><p>98 pages, 2 figures, updated proof sketch</p></details> |

However, its application to vehicle wheel design remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets that include 3D geometry and physical performance metrics. To address this gap, this study proposes a synthetic design-performance dataset generation framework using generative AI. The proposed framework first generates 2D rendered images using Stable Diffusion, and then reconstructs the 3D geometry through 2.5D depth estimation. Structural simulations are subsequently performed to extract engineering performance data. To further expand the design and performance space, topology optimization is applied, enabling the generation of a more diverse set of wheel designs. The final dataset, named DeepWheel, consists of over 6,000 photo-realistic images and 900 structurally analyzed 3D models. This multi-modal dataset serves as a valuable resource for surrogate model training, data-driven inverse design, and design space exploration.

| **[Autoregressive Distillation of Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11295v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models with transformer architectures have demonstrated promising capabilities in generating high-fidelity images and scalability for high resolution. However, iterative sampling process required for synthesis is very resource-intensive. A line of work has focused on distilling solutions to probability flow ODEs into few-step student models. Nevertheless, existing methods have been limited by their reliance on the most recent denoised samples as input, rendering them susceptible to exposure bias. To address this limitation, we propose AutoRegressive Distillation (ARD), a novel approach that leverages the historical trajectory of the ODE to predict future steps. ARD offers two key benefits: 1) it mitigates exposure bias by utilizing a predicted historical trajectory that is less susceptible to accumulated errors, and 2) it leverages the previous history of the ODE trajectory as a more effective source of coarse-grained information. ARD modifies the teacher transformer architecture by adding token-wise time embedding to mark each input from the trajectory history and employs a block-wise causal attention mask for training. Furthermore, incorporating historical inputs only in lower transformer layers enhances performance and efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of ARD in a class-conditioned generation on ImageNet and T2I synthesis. Our model achieves a $5\times$ reduction in FID degradation compared to the baseline methods while requiring only 1.1\% extra FLOPs on ImageNet-256. Moreover, ARD reaches FID of 1.84 on ImageNet-256 in merely 4 steps and outperforms the publicly available 1024p text-to-image distilled models in prompt adherence score with a minimal drop in FID compared to the teacher.

Unrestricted adversarial attacks typically manipulate the semantic content of an image (e.g., color or texture) to create adversarial examples that are both effective and photorealistic. Recent works have utilized the diffusion inversion process to map images into a latent space, where high-level semantics are manipulated by introducing perturbations. However, they often results in substantial semantic distortions in the denoised output and suffers from low efficiency. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Semantic-Consistent Unrestricted Adversarial Attacks (SCA), which employs an inversion method to extract edit-friendly noise maps and utilizes Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to provide semantic guidance throughout the process. Under the condition of rich semantic information provided by MLLM, we perform the DDPM denoising process of each step using a series of edit-friendly noise maps, and leverage DPM Solver++ to accelerate this process, enabling efficient sampling with semantic consistency. Compared to existing methods, our framework enables the efficient generation of adversarial examples that exhibit minimal discernible semantic changes. Consequently, we for the first time introduce Semantic-Consistent Adversarial Examples (SCAE). Extensive experiments and visualizations have demonstrated the high efficiency of SCA, particularly in being on average 12 times faster than the state-of-the-art attacks. Our research can further draw attention to the security of multimedia information.</p></details> |  |
| **[LL-Gaussian: Low-Light Scene Reconstruction and Enhancement via Gaussian Splatting for Novel View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10331v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel view synthesis (NVS) in low-light scenes remains a significant challenge due to degraded inputs characterized by severe noise, low dynamic range (LDR) and unreliable initialization. While recent NeRF-based approaches have shown promising results, most suffer from high computational costs, and some rely on carefully captured or pre-processed data--such as RAW sensor inputs or multi-exposure sequences--which severely limits their practicality. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with competitive visual fidelity; however, existing 3DGS-based methods struggle with low-light sRGB inputs, resulting in unstable Gaussian initialization and ineffective noise suppression. To address these challenges, we propose LL-Gaussian, a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and enhancement from low-light sRGB images, enabling pseudo normal-light novel view synthesis. Our method introduces three key innovations: 1) an end-to-end Low-Light Gaussian Initialization Module (LLGIM) that leverages dense priors from learning-based MVS approach to generate high-quality initial point clouds; 2) a dual-branch Gaussian decomposition model that disentangles intrinsic scene properties (reflectance and illumination) from transient interference, enabling stable and interpretable optimization; 3) an unsupervised optimization strategy guided by both physical constrains and diffusion prior to jointly steer decomposition and enhancement. Additionally, we contribute a challenging dataset collected in extreme low-light environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of LL-Gaussian. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, LL-Gaussian achieves up to 2,000 times faster inference and reduces training time to just 2%, while delivering superior reconstruction and rendering quality.</p></details> |  |

This latent space represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the physical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on understanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and interpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach but enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities for improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold geometry.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, due to limitations in data and computational resources, achieving efficient generation of long videos with rich motion dynamics remains a significant challenge. To generate high-quality, dynamic, and temporally consistent long videos, this paper presents ARLON, a novel framework that boosts diffusion Transformers with autoregressive models for long video generation, by integrating the coarse spatial and long-range temporal information provided by the AR model to guide the DiT model. Specifically, ARLON incorporates several key innovations: 1) A latent Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) compresses the input latent space of the DiT model into compact visual tokens, bridging the AR and DiT models and balancing the learning complexity and information density; 2) An adaptive norm-based semantic injection module integrates the coarse discrete visual units from the AR model into the DiT model, ensuring effective guidance during video generation; 3) To enhance the tolerance capability of noise introduced from the AR inference, the DiT model is trained with coarser visual latent tokens incorporated with an uncertainty sampling module. Experimental results demonstrate that ARLON significantly outperforms the baseline OpenSora-V1.2 on eight out of eleven metrics selected from VBench, with notable improvements in dynamic degree and aesthetic quality, while delivering competitive results on the remaining three and simultaneously accelerating the generation process. In addition, ARLON achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation. Detailed analyses of the improvements in inference efficiency are presented, alongside a practical application that demonstrates the generation of long videos using progressive text prompts.

These models embed nuclei-specific priors to outperform generic architectures like U-Nets; however, they require large annotated datasets, which are often not available. Generative models (GANs, diffusion models) have been used to compensate for this by synthesizing training data. These two-stage approaches are computationally expensive, as first a generative model and then a segmentation model has to be trained. We propose CyclePose, a hybrid framework integrating synthetic data generation and segmentation training. CyclePose builds on a CycleGAN architecture, which allows unpaired translation between microscopy images and segmentation masks.

Assume that the drift coefficient of the free stochastic differential equations is operator Lipschitz and the diffusion coefficients are locally operator Lipschitz, we prove the strong convergence of the numerical methods. Moreover, we investigate the exponential stability in mean square of the equations and the numerical methods. In particular, the free stochastic theta methods with $\theta \in [1/2, 1]$ can inherit the exponential stability of original equations for any given step size.

To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)-based approach for SAR-to-RGB translation, generating synthetic optical images from SAR inputs. We explore three different setups: two using Standard Diffusion, which reconstruct S2 images by adding and removing noise (one without and one with class conditioning), and one using Cold Diffusion, which blends S2 with S1 before removing the SAR signal. We evaluate the generated images in downstream tasks, including land cover classification and cloud removal. While generated images may not perfectly replicate real S2 data, they still provide valuable information. Our results show that class conditioning improves classification accuracy, while cloud removal performance remains competitive despite our approach not being optimized for it. Interestingly, despite exhibiting lower perceptual quality, the Cold Diffusion setup performs well in land cover classification, suggesting that traditional quantitative evaluation metrics may not fully reflect the practical utility of generated images. Our findings highlight the potential of DMs for SAR-to-RGB translation in RS applications where RGB images are missing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

An intuitive solution involves adopting consistency models, which serve as an effective acceleration paradigm through consistency distillation. However, simply employing this strategy in human image animation often leads to quality decline, including visual blurring, motion degradation, and facial distortion, particularly in dynamic regions. In this paper, we propose the DanceLCM approach complemented by several enhancements to improve visual quality and motion continuity at low-step regime: (1) segmented consistency distillation with an auxiliary light-weight head to incorporate supervision from real video latents, mitigating cumulative errors resulting from single full-trajectory generation; (2) a motion-focused loss to centre on motion regions, and explicit injection of facial fidelity features to improve face authenticity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DanceLCM achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art video diffusion models with a mere 2-4 inference steps, significantly reducing the inference burden without compromising video quality.

Up to authors' knowledge this is the first work addressing this second-order quantitative stability estimate in general unbounded settings. Our proof strategy relies on semiconcavity properties of entropic potentials and on the representation of entropic transport plans as laws of forward and backward diffusion processes, known as Schr\"odinger bridges. Moreover, our approach allows to deduce a stochastic proof of quantitative stability entropic estimates and integrated gradient estimates as well. Finally, as a direct consequence of these stability bounds, we deduce exponential convergence rates for gradient and Hessian of Sinkhorn iterates along Sinkhorn's algorithm, a problem that was still open in unbounded settings. Our rates have a polynomial dependence on the regularization parameter.</p></details> | 30 pages |

Such issues are mainly caused by the lack of high-quality paired training data, as well as the self-supervised training paradigm adopted in these methods, which forces the model to in-paint the masked regions, leading to ambiguity between synthesizing the masked objects and restoring the background. To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised learning strategy with human-in-the-loop to create high-quality paired training data, aiming to train a Robust Object Remover (RORem). We first collect 60K training pairs from open-source datasets to train an initial object removal model for generating removal samples, and then utilize human feedback to select a set of high-quality object removal pairs, with which we train a discriminator to automate the following training data generation process. By iterating this process for several rounds, we finally obtain a substantial object removal dataset with over 200K pairs. Fine-tuning the pre-trained stable diffusion model with this dataset, we obtain our RORem, which demonstrates state-of-the-art object removal performance in terms of both reliability and image quality. Particularly, RORem improves the object removal success rate over previous methods by more than 18\%. The dataset, source code and trained model are available at https://github.com/leeruibin/RORem.</p></details> |  |

We define bias as a model's unfair deviation from population statistics given neutral prompts. Our experiments with Stable Diffusion XL, 3.5 and Flux demonstrate that LLM-modified prompts significantly increase image diversity and reduce bias without the need to change the image generators themselves. While occasionally producing results that diverge from original user intent for elaborate prompts, this approach generally provides more varied interpretations of underspecified requests rather than superficial variations. The method works particularly well for less advanced image generators, though limitations persist for certain contexts like disability representation. All prompts and generated images are available at https://iisys-hof.github.io/llm-prompt-img-gen/</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in protein structure prediction and machine learning-driven molecule generation offer a promising opportunity to accelerate drug discovery. However, practical guidance on selecting and integrating these models into real-world pipelines remains limited. In this study, we develop an end-to-end, artificial intelligence-guided antibiotic discovery pipeline that spans target identification to compound realization. We leverage structure-based clustering across predicted proteomes of multiple pathogens to identify conserved, essential, and non-human-homologous targets. We then systematically evaluate six leading 3D-structure-aware generative models$\unicode{x2014}$spanning diffusion, autoregressive, graph neural network, and language model architectures$\unicode{x2014}$on their usability, chemical validity, and biological relevance. Rigorous post-processing filters and commercial analogue searches reduce over 100 000 generated compounds to a focused, synthesizable set. Our results highlight DeepBlock and TamGen as top performers across diverse criteria, while also revealing critical trade-offs between model complexity, usability, and output quality. This work provides a comparative benchmark and blueprint for deploying artificial intelligence in early-stage antibiotic development.</p></details> | 12 pages, preprint |
| **[Defending Against Frequency-Based Attacks with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11034v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial training is a common strategy for enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks. However, it is typically tailored to the specific attack types it is trained on, limiting its ability to generalize to unseen threat models. Adversarial purification offers an alternative by leveraging a generative model to remove perturbations before classification. Since the purifier is trained independently of both the classifier and the threat models, it is better equipped to handle previously unseen attack scenarios. Diffusion models have proven highly effective for noise purification, not only in countering pixel-wise adversarial perturbations but also in addressing non-adversarial data shifts. In this study, we broaden the focus beyond pixel-wise robustness to explore the extent to which purification can mitigate both spectral and spatial adversarial attacks. Our findings highlight its effectiveness in handling diverse distortion patterns across low- to high-frequency regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), 5th Workshop on Adversarial Machine Learning in Computer Vision: Foundation Models + X</p></details> |

However, despite numerous works addressing this area, it remains a topic that requires further elaboration. Most often, it is considered within the scope of classically defined graphs with a spreading model in the form of Independent Cascades. In this work, we focus on the problem of budget-constrained influence maximisation in multilayer networks using a Linear Threshold Model. Both the graph model and the spreading process we employ are less prevalent in the literature, even though their application allows for a more precise representation of the opinion dynamics in social networks. This paper aims to answer which of the sixteen evaluated seed selection methods is the most effective and how similar they are. Additionally, we focus our analysis on the impact of spreading model parameters, network characteristics, a budget, and the seed selection methods on the diffusion effectiveness in multilayer networks. Our contribution also includes extending several centrality measures and heuristics to the case of such graphs. The results indicate that all the factors mentioned above collectively contribute to the effectiveness of influence maximisation. Moreover, there is no seed selection method which always provides the best results. However, the seeds chosen with VoteRank-based methods (especially with the $v-rnk-m$ variant we propose) usually provide the most extensive diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version of the article has been accepted for publication, after peer review, but is not the Version of Record and does not reflect post-acceptance improvements, or any corrections.

While prior work in IMDL has focused largely on natural images, the anime domain remains underexplored-despite its growing vulnerability to AI-generated forgeries. Misrepresentations of AI-generated images as hand-drawn artwork, copyright violations, and inappropriate content modifications pose serious threats to the anime community and industry. To address this gap, we propose AnimeDL-2M, the first large-scale benchmark for anime IMDL with comprehensive annotations. It comprises over two million images including real, partially manipulated, and fully AI-generated samples. Experiments indicate that models trained on existing IMDL datasets of natural images perform poorly when applied to anime images, highlighting a clear domain gap between anime and natural images. To better handle IMDL tasks in anime domain, we further propose AniXplore, a novel model tailored to the visual characteristics of anime imagery. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AniXplore achieves superior performance compared to existing methods. Dataset and code can be found in https://flytweety.github.io/AnimeDL2M/.</p></details> |  |

While Interior Penalty Galerkin (IPG) methods already proved efficient in the situation of large mesh Peclet numbers, Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) methods are able to reduce the convection-dominance by moving the mesh. In this paper, we introduce and analyse a velocity-based moving mesh discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the solution of the linear advection-diffusion equation. By introducing a smooth parameterized velocity $\Tilde{V}$ that separates the flow into a mean flow, also called moving mesh velocity, and a remaining advection field $V-\Tilde{V}$, we made a convergence analysis based on the smoothness of the mesh velocity. Furthermore, the reduction of the advection speed improves the stability of an explicit time-stepping. Finally, by adapting the existing robust error criteria to this moving mesh situation, we derived robust \textit{a posteriori} error criteria that describe the potentially small deviation to the mean flow and include the information of a transition towards $V=\Tilde{V}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 2 figures, Submitted to CAMC (Communications on Applied Mathematics and Computation) on 15/04/2025, not yet reviewed (15/04/2025)</p></details> |
| **[TMCIR: Token Merge Benefits Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10995v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves target images using a multi-modal query that combines a reference image with text describing desired modifications. The primary challenge is effectively fusing this visual and textual information. Current cross-modal feature fusion approaches for CIR exhibit an inherent bias in intention interpretation. These methods tend to disproportionately emphasize either the reference image features (visual-dominant fusion) or the textual modification intent (text-dominant fusion through image-to-text conversion). Such an imbalanced representation often fails to accurately capture and reflect the actual search intent of the user in the retrieval results. To address this challenge, we propose TMCIR, a novel framework that advances composed image retrieval through two key innovations: 1) Intent-Aware Cross-Modal Alignment. We first fine-tune CLIP encoders contrastively using intent-reflecting pseudo-target images, synthesized from reference images and textual descriptions via a diffusion model. This step enhances the encoder ability of text to capture nuanced intents in textual descriptions. 2) Adaptive Token Fusion. We further fine-tune all encoders contrastively by comparing adaptive token-fusion features with the target image. This mechanism dynamically balances visual and textual representations within the contrastive learning pipeline, optimizing the composed feature for retrieval. Extensive experiments on Fashion-IQ and CIRR datasets demonstrate that TMCIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing nuanced user intent.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.05473 by other authors</p></details> |

Deep generative methods, such as autoregressive models and diffusion models, have greatly accelerated the discovery of novel protein sequences. However, these methods mainly focus on local or shallow residual semantics and suffer from low inference efficiency, large modeling space and high training cost. To address these challenges, we introduce ProtFlow, a fast flow matching-based protein sequence design framework that operates on embeddings derived from semantically meaningful latent space of protein language models. By compressing and smoothing the latent space, ProtFlow enhances performance while training on limited computational resources. Leveraging reflow techniques, ProtFlow enables high-quality single-step sequence generation. Additionally, we develop a joint design pipeline for the design scene of multichain proteins. We evaluate ProtFlow across diverse protein design tasks, including general peptides and long-chain proteins, antimicrobial peptides, and antibodies. Experimental results demonstrate that ProtFlow outperforms task-specific methods in these applications, underscoring its potential and broad applicability in computational protein sequence design and analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[OctGPT: Octree-based Multiscale Autoregressive Models for 3D Shape Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09975v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet their performance in 3D shape generation lags significantly behind that of diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce OctGPT, a novel multiscale autoregressive model for 3D shape generation that dramatically improves the efficiency and performance of prior 3D autoregressive approaches, while rivaling or surpassing state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our method employs a serialized octree representation to efficiently capture the hierarchical and spatial structures of 3D shapes. Coarse geometry is encoded via octree structures, while fine-grained details are represented by binary tokens generated using a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE), transforming 3D shapes into compact multiscale binary sequences suitable for autoregressive prediction. To address the computational challenges of handling long sequences, we incorporate octree-based transformers enhanced with 3D rotary positional encodings, scale-specific embeddings, and token-parallel generation schemes. These innovations reduce training time by 13 folds and generation time by 69 folds, enabling the efficient training of high-resolution 3D shapes, e.g.,$1024^3$, on just four NVIDIA 4090 GPUs only within days. OctGPT showcases exceptional versatility across various tasks, including text-, sketch-, and image-conditioned generation, as well as scene-level synthesis involving multiple objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OctGPT accelerates convergence and improves generation quality over prior autoregressive methods, offering a new paradigm for high-quality, scalable 3D content creation.

However, most existing methods rely on separate modules for each modality, with limited exploration of unified generative architectures. In addition, many are confined to a single task and small-scale datasets. To address these limitations, we first propose UniForm, a unified multi-task diffusion transformer that jointly generates audio and visual modalities in a shared latent space. A single diffusion process models both audio and video, capturing the inherent correlations between sound and vision. Second, we introduce task-specific noise schemes and task tokens, enabling a single model to support multiple tasks, including text-to-audio-video, audio-to-video, and video-to-audio generation. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models and a large-scale text-audio-video combined dataset, UniForm achieves greater generative diversity than prior approaches. Extensive experiments show that UniForm achieves the state-of-the-art performance across audio-video generation tasks, producing content that is both well-aligned and close to real-world data distributions.

These interactions are essential for emerging biometric authentication systems, which rely on interactive motion-based anti-spoofing approaches. From a security perspective, there is a growing need for large-scale, high-quality interactive videos to train and strengthen authentication models. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for animating realistic hand-face interactions. Our approach simultaneously learns spatio-temporal contact dynamics and biomechanically plausible deformation effects, enabling natural interactions where hand movements induce anatomically accurate facial deformations while maintaining collision-free contact. To facilitate this research, we present InterHF, a large-scale hand-face interaction dataset featuring 18 interaction patterns and 90,000 annotated videos. Additionally, we propose InterAnimate, a region-aware diffusion model designed specifically for interaction animation. InterAnimate leverages learnable spatial and temporal latents to effectively capture dynamic interaction priors and integrates a region-aware interaction mechanism that injects these priors into the denoising process. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first large-scale effort to systematically study human hand-face interactions. Qualitative and quantitative results show InterAnimate produces highly realistic animations, setting a new benchmark. Code and data will be made public to advance research.</p></details> | under preview |
| **[Bringing together invertible UNets with invertible attention modules for memory-efficient diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10883v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently gained state of the art performance on many image generation tasks. However, most models require significant computational resources to achieve this. This becomes apparent in the application of medical image synthesis due to the 3D nature of medical datasets like CT-scans, MRIs, electron microscope, etc. In this paper we propose a novel architecture for a single GPU memory-efficient training for diffusion models for high dimensional medical datasets. The proposed model is built by using an invertible UNet architecture with invertible attention modules. This leads to the following two contributions: 1. denoising diffusion models and thus enabling memory usage to be independent of the dimensionality of the dataset, and 2. reducing the energy usage during training. While this new model can be applied to a multitude of image generation tasks, we showcase its memory-efficiency on the 3D BraTS2020 dataset leading to up to 15\% decrease in peak memory consumption during training with comparable results to SOTA while maintaining the image quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[PT-Mark: Invisible Watermarking for Text-to-image Diffusion Models via Semantic-aware Pivotal Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10853v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking for diffusion images has drawn considerable attention due to the widespread use of text-to-image diffusion models and the increasing need for their copyright protection. Recently, advanced watermarking techniques, such as Tree Ring, integrate watermarks by embedding traceable patterns (e.g., Rings) into the latent distribution during the diffusion process. Such methods disrupt the original semantics of the generated images due to the inevitable distribution shift caused by the watermarks, thereby limiting their practicality, particularly in digital art creation. In this work, we present Semantic-aware Pivotal Tuning Watermarks (PT-Mark), a novel invisible watermarking method that preserves both the semantics of diffusion images and the traceability of the watermark. PT-Mark preserves the original semantics of the watermarked image by gradually aligning the generation trajectory with the original (pivotal) trajectory while maintaining the traceable watermarks during whole diffusion denoising process. To achieve this, we first compute the salient regions of the watermark at each diffusion denoising step as a spatial prior to identify areas that can be aligned without disrupting the watermark pattern. Guided by the region, we then introduce an additional pivotal tuning branch that optimizes the text embedding to align the semantics while preserving the watermarks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PT-Mark can preserve the original semantics of the diffusion images while integrating robust watermarks. It achieves a 10% improvement in the performance of semantic preservation (i.e., SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS) compared to state-of-the-art watermarking methods, while also showing comparable robustness against real-world perturbations and four times greater efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[SteerMusic: Enhanced Musical Consistency for Zero-shot Text-Guided and Personalized Music Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10826v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Music editing is an important step in music production, which has broad applications, including game development and film production. Most existing zero-shot text-guided methods rely on pretrained diffusion models by involving forward-backward diffusion processes for editing. However, these methods often struggle to maintain the music content consistency. Additionally, text instructions alone usually fail to accurately describe the desired music. In this paper, we propose two music editing methods that enhance the consistency between the original and edited music by leveraging score distillation. The first method, SteerMusic, is a coarse-grained zero-shot editing approach using delta denoising score. The second method, SteerMusic+, enables fine-grained personalized music editing by manipulating a concept token that represents a user-defined musical style. SteerMusic+ allows for the editing of music into any user-defined musical styles that cannot be achieved by the text instructions alone. Experimental results show that our methods outperform existing approaches in preserving both music content consistency and editing fidelity. User studies further validate that our methods achieve superior music editing quality. Audio examples are available on https://steermusic.pages.dev/.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, OmniVDiff treats all video visual modalities in the color space to learn a joint distribution, while employing an adaptive control strategy that dynamically adjusts the role of each visual modality during the diffusion process, either as a generation modality or a conditioning modality. This allows flexible manipulation of each modality's role, enabling support for a wide range of tasks. Consequently, our model supports three key functionalities: (1) Text-conditioned video generation: multi-modal visual video sequences (i.e., rgb, depth, canny, segmentaion) are generated based on the text conditions in one diffusion process; (2) Video understanding: OmniVDiff can estimate the depth, canny map, and semantic segmentation across the input rgb frames while ensuring coherence with the rgb input; and (3) X-conditioned video generation: OmniVDiff generates videos conditioned on fine-grained attributes (e.g., depth maps or segmentation maps). By integrating these diverse tasks into a unified video diffusion framework, OmniVDiff enhances the flexibility and scalability for controllable video diffusion, making it an effective tool for a variety of downstream applications, such as video-to-video translation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential for various video-related applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project page: https://tele-ai.github.io/OmniVDiff/</p></details> |

Recent advances have explored two promising directions: multiview generative models that train on 3D consistent datasets but struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, and 3D scene inpainting and completion frameworks that suffer from cross-view inconsistency and suboptimal error handling, as they depend exclusively on depth data or 3D smoothness, which ultimately degrades output quality and computational performance. Building upon these approaches, we present GaussVideoDreamer, which advances generative multimedia approaches by bridging the gap between image, video, and 3D generation, integrating their strengths through two key innovations: (1) A progressive video inpainting strategy that harnesses temporal coherence for improved multiview consistency and faster convergence. (2) A 3D Gaussian Splatting consistency mask to guide the video diffusion with 3D consistent multiview evidence. Our pipeline combines three core components: a geometry-aware initialization protocol, Inconsistency-Aware Gaussian Splatting, and a progressive video inpainting strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves 32% higher LLaVA-IQA scores and at least 2x speedup compared to existing methods while maintaining robust performance across diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |

While video recordings of sign language are commonly used for education and documentation, the dynamic nature of signs can make it challenging to study them in detail, especially for new learners and educators. This work aims to convert sign language video footage into static illustrations, which serve as an additional educational resource to complement video content. This process is usually done by an artist, and is therefore quite costly. We propose a method that illustrates sign language videos by leveraging generative models' ability to understand both the semantic and geometric aspects of images. Our approach focuses on transferring a sketch like illustration style to video footage of sign language, combining the start and end frames of a sign into a single illustration, and using arrows to highlight the hand's direction and motion. While many style transfer methods address domain adaptation at varying levels of abstraction, applying a sketch like style to sign languages, especially for hand gestures and facial expressions, poses a significant challenge. To tackle this, we intervene in the denoising process of a diffusion model, injecting style as keys and values into high resolution attention layers, and fusing geometric information from the image and edges as queries. For the final illustration, we use the attention mechanism to combine the attention weights from both the start and end illustrations, resulting in a soft combination. Our method offers a cost effective solution for generating sign language illustrations at inference time, addressing the lack of such resources in educational materials.</p></details> |  |

Our method proposes using HDR Gaussian Splats as light source representation, marking the first time regular images can serve as light sources in a 3D renderer. Our two-stage process first enhances the dynamic range of images plausibly and accurately by leveraging the priors embedded in diffusion models. Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources. We assess our method using a combination of this novel dataset and an existing dataset from the literature. The code to reproduce our method will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

While task-specific LoRAs are often available, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property can restrict access to training data, limiting the acquisition of a multi-task model through gradient-based training. In response, LoRA merging presents an effective solution by combining multiple LoRAs into a unified adapter while maintaining data privacy. Prior works on LoRA merging primarily frame it as an optimization problem, yet these approaches face several limitations, including the rough assumption about input features utilized in optimization, massive sample requirements, and the unbalanced optimization objective. These limitations can significantly degrade performance. To address these, we propose a novel optimization-based method, named IterIS: 1) We formulate LoRA merging as an advanced optimization problem to mitigate the rough assumption. Additionally, we employ an iterative inference-solving framework in our algorithm. It can progressively refine the optimization objective for improved performance. 2) We introduce an efficient regularization term to reduce the need for massive sample requirements (requiring only 1-5% of the unlabeled samples compared to prior methods). 3) We utilize adaptive weights in the optimization objective to mitigate potential unbalances in LoRA merging process. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over multiple baselines and state-of-the-art methods in composing tasks for text-to-image diffusion, vision-language models, and large language models. Furthermore, our layer-wise algorithm can achieve convergence with minimal steps, ensuring efficiency in both memory and computation.</p></details> |  |

Most current approaches are constrained to limited angular ranges, predominantly focusing on frontal or near-frontal views. Moreover, although the recent emerging large-scale diffusion models have been proven robust in handling 3D scenes, they underperform on facial data, given their complex structure and the uncanny valley pitfalls. In this paper, we propose SpinMeRound, a diffusion-based approach designed to generate consistent and accurate head portraits from novel viewpoints. By leveraging a number of input views alongside an identity embedding, our method effectively synthesizes diverse viewpoints of a subject whilst robustly maintaining its unique identity features. Through experimentation, we showcase our model's generation capabilities in 360 head synthesis, while beating current state-of-the-art multiview diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Stochastic interpolation generates a data sample by first randomly initializing a particle drawn from a simple base distribution, then simulating deterministic or stochastic dynamics such that in finite time the particle's distribution converges to the target. We show that for a Gaussian base distribution and a strongly log-concave target distribution, the stochastic interpolation flow map is Lipschitz with a sharp constant which matches that of Caffarelli's theorem for optimal transport maps. We are further able to construct Lipschitz transport maps between non-Gaussian distributions, generalizing some recent constructions in the literature on transport methods for establishing functional inequalities.

Prior works formulate the traffic layout generation as predictive progress, either by denoising entire sequences at once or by iteratively predicting the next frame. However, full sequence denoising hinders online reaction, while the latter's short-sighted next-frame prediction lacks precise goal-state guidance. Further, the learned model struggles to generate complex or challenging scenarios due to a large number of safe and ordinal driving behaviors from open datasets. To overcome these, we introduce Nexus, a decoupled scene generation framework that improves reactivity and goal conditioning by simulating both ordinal and challenging scenarios from fine-grained tokens with independent noise states. At the core of the decoupled pipeline is the integration of a partial noise-masking training strategy and a noise-aware schedule that ensures timely environmental updates throughout the denoising process. To complement challenging scenario generation, we collect a dataset consisting of complex corner cases. It covers 540 hours of simulated data, including high-risk interactions such as cut-in, sudden braking, and collision. Nexus achieves superior generation realism while preserving reactivity and goal orientation, with a 40% reduction in displacement error. We further demonstrate that Nexus improves closed-loop planning by 20% through data augmentation and showcase its capability in safety-critical data generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[REPA-E: Unlocking VAE for End-to-End Tuning with Latent Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10483v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we tackle a fundamental question: "Can we train latent diffusion models together with the variational auto-encoder (VAE) tokenizer in an end-to-end manner?" Traditional deep-learning wisdom dictates that end-to-end training is often preferable when possible. However, for latent diffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and diffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a degradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is ineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the representation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model to be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the proposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up diffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training recipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with REPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure and downstream generation performance. In terms of final performance, our approach sets a new state-of-the-art; achieving FID of 1.26 and 1.83 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256 x 256.

However, the power of AE has long been underexplored in terms of network design, compression ratio, and training strategy. In this work, we systematically examine the architecture design choices and optimize the computation distribution to obtain a series of efficient and high-compression video AEs that can decode in real time on mobile devices. We also unify the design of plain Autoencoder and image-conditioned I2V VAE, achieving multifunctionality in a single network. In addition, we find that the widely adopted discriminative losses, i.e., GAN, LPIPS, and DWT losses, provide no significant improvements when training AEs at scale. We propose a novel latent consistency loss that does not require complicated discriminator design or hyperparameter tuning, but provides stable improvements in reconstruction quality. Our AE achieves an ultra-high compression ratio and real-time decoding speed on mobile while outperforming prior art in terms of reconstruction metrics by a large margin. We finally validate our AE by training a DiT on its latent space and demonstrate fast, high-quality text-to-video generation capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Analysis of Interpretable Aging across Thousands of Lithium-ion Battery Cycles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10439v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model is a common mechanistic model for lithium-ion batteries. The reaction rate constant and diffusivity within the DFN model are key parameters that directly affect the movement of lithium ions, thereby offering explanations for cell aging. This work investigates the ability to uniquely estimate each electrode's diffusion coefficients and reaction rate constants of 95 Tesla Model 3 cells with a nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) cathode and silicon oxide--graphite (LiC$_\text{6}$--SiO$_{\text{x}}$) anode. The parameters are estimated at intermittent diagnostic cycles over the lifetime of each cell. The four parameters are estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for uncertainty quantification (UQ) for a total of 7776 cycles at discharge C-rates of C/5, 1C, and 2C. While one or more anode parameters are uniquely identifiable over every cell's lifetime, cathode parameters become identifiable at mid- to end-of-life, indicating measurable resistive growth in the cathode. The contribution of key parameters to the state of health (SOH) is expressed as a power law. This model for SOH shows a high consistency with the MCMC results performed over the overall lifespan of each cell. Our approach suggests that effective diagnosis of aging can be achieved by predicting the trajectories of the parameters contributing to cell aging. As such, extending our analysis with more physically accurate models building on DFN may lead to more identifiable parameters and further improved aging predictions.</p></details> | 28 pages, 7 figures |

| **[Anchor Token Matching: Implicit Structure Locking for Training-free AR Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10434v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation has seen groundbreaking advancements with diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity synthesis and precise image editing through cross-attention manipulation. Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have re-emerged as powerful alternatives, leveraging next-token generation to match diffusion models. However, existing editing techniques designed for diffusion models fail to translate directly to AR models due to fundamental differences in structural control. Specifically, AR models suffer from spatial poverty of attention maps and sequential accumulation of structural errors during image editing, which disrupt object layouts and global consistency. In this work, we introduce Implicit Structure Locking (ISLock), the first training-free editing strategy for AR visual models. Rather than relying on explicit attention manipulation or fine-tuning, ISLock preserves structural blueprints by dynamically aligning self-attention patterns with reference images through the Anchor Token Matching (ATM) protocol. By implicitly enforcing structural consistency in latent space, our method ISLock enables structure-aware editing while maintaining generative autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ISLock achieves high-quality, structure-consistent edits without additional training and is superior or comparable to conventional editing techniques. Our findings pioneer the way for efficient and flexible AR-based image editing, further bridging the performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive generative models. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/hutaiHang/ATM</p></details> |  |

For this task, monocular category-level methods are attractive as they require only a single RGB camera. However, current methods rely on shape priors or CAD models of the intra-class known objects. We propose a diffusion-based monocular category-level 9D object pose generation method, MonoDiff9D. Our motivation is to leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models to alleviate the need for shape priors, CAD models, or depth sensors for intra-class unknown object pose estimation. We first estimate coarse depth via DINOv2 from the monocular image in a zero-shot manner and convert it into a point cloud. We then fuse the global features of the point cloud with the input image and use the fused features along with the encoded time step to condition MonoDiff9D. Finally, we design a transformer-based denoiser to recover the object pose from Gaussian noise. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmark datasets show that MonoDiff9D achieves state-of-the-art monocular category-level 9D object pose estimation accuracy without the need for shape priors or CAD models at any stage. Our code will be made public at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/MonoDiff9D.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA'25 |

While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, existing methods often treat TC evolution as a series of independent frame-to-frame predictions, limiting their ability to capture long-term dynamics. We present a novel application of video diffusion models for TC forecasting that explicitly models temporal dependencies through additional temporal layers. Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that significantly improves individual-frame quality and performance in low-data regimes. Experimental results show our method outperforms the previous approach of Nath et al. by 19.3% in MAE, 16.2% in PSNR, and 36.1% in SSIM. Most notably, we extend the reliable forecasting horizon from 36 to 50 hours. Through comprehensive evaluation using both traditional metrics and Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), we demonstrate that our approach produces more temporally coherent forecasts while maintaining competitive single-frame quality.

| **[GAF: Gaussian Avatar Reconstruction from Monocular Videos via Multi-view Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10209v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach for reconstructing animatable 3D Gaussian avatars from monocular videos captured by commodity devices like smartphones. Photorealistic 3D head avatar reconstruction from such recordings is challenging due to limited observations, which leaves unobserved regions under-constrained and can lead to artifacts in novel views. To address this problem, we introduce a multi-view head diffusion model, leveraging its priors to fill in missing regions and ensure view consistency in Gaussian splatting renderings. To enable precise viewpoint control, we use normal maps rendered from FLAME-based head reconstruction, which provides pixel-aligned inductive biases. We also condition the diffusion model on VAE features extracted from the input image to preserve facial identity and appearance details. For Gaussian avatar reconstruction, we distill multi-view diffusion priors by using iteratively denoised images as pseudo-ground truths, effectively mitigating over-saturation issues. To further improve photorealism, we apply latent upsampling priors to refine the denoised latent before decoding it into an image. We evaluate our method on the NeRSemble dataset, showing that GAF outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate higher-fidelity avatar reconstructions from monocular videos captured on commodity devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Video: https://youtu.be/QuIYTljvhyg Project Page: https://tangjiapeng.github.io/projects/GAF</p></details> |
| **[An Antithetic Multilevel Monte Carlo-Milstein Scheme for Stochastic Partial Differential Equations with non-commutative noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14169v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel multilevel Monte Carlo approach for estimating quantities of interest for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). Drawing inspiration from [Giles and Szpruch: Antithetic multilevel Monte Carlo estimation for multi-dimensional SDEs without L\'evy area simulation, Annals of Appl. Prob., 2014], we extend the antithetic Milstein scheme for finite-dimensional stochastic differential equations to Hilbert space-valued SPDEs. Our method has the advantages of both Euler and Milstein discretizations, as it is easy to implement and does not involve intractable L\'evy area terms. Moreover, the antithetic correction in our method leads to the same variance decay in a MLMC algorithm as the standard Milstein method, resulting in significantly lower computational complexity than a corresponding MLMC Euler scheme. Our approach is applicable to a broader range of non-linear diffusion coefficients and does not require any commutative properties. The key component of our MLMC algorithm is a truncated Milstein-type time stepping scheme for SPDEs, which accelerates the rate of variance decay in the MLMC method when combined with an antithetic coupling on the fine scales. We combine the truncated Milstein scheme with appropriate spatial discretizations and noise approximations on all scales to obtain a fully discrete scheme and show that the antithetic coupling does not introduce an additional bias.</p></details> | 36 pages |

We identify three key properties of attention in VDiTs: Structure, Sparsity, and Sinks. Structure: We observe that attention patterns across different VDiTs exhibit similar structure across different prompts, and that we can make use of the similarity of attention patterns to unlock video editing via self-attention map transfer. Sparse: We study attention sparsity in VDiTs, finding that proposed sparsity methods do not work for all VDiTs, because some layers that are seemingly sparse cannot be sparsified. Sinks: We make the first study of attention sinks in VDiTs, comparing and contrasting them to attention sinks in language models. We propose a number of future directions that can make use of our insights to improve the efficiency-quality Pareto frontier for VDiTs.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffMOD: Progressive Diffusion Point Denoising for Moving Object Detection in Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10278v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moving object detection (MOD) in remote sensing is significantly challenged by low resolution, extremely small object sizes, and complex noise interference. Current deep learning-based MOD methods rely on probability density estimation, which restricts flexible information interaction between objects and across temporal frames. To flexibly capture high-order inter-object and temporal relationships, we propose a point-based MOD in remote sensing. Inspired by diffusion models, the network optimization is formulated as a progressive denoising process that iteratively recovers moving object centers from sparse noisy points. Specifically, we sample scattered features from the backbone outputs as atomic units for subsequent processing, while global feature embeddings are aggregated to compensate for the limited coverage of sparse point features. By modeling spatial relative positions and semantic affinities, Spatial Relation Aggregation Attention is designed to enable high-order interactions among point-level features for enhanced object representation. To enhance temporal consistency, the Temporal Propagation and Global Fusion module is designed, which leverages an implicit memory reasoning mechanism for robust cross-frame feature integration. To align with the progressive denoising process, we propose a progressive MinK optimal transport assignment strategy that establishes specialized learning objectives at each denoising level. Additionally, we introduce a missing loss function to counteract the clustering tendency of denoised points around salient objects. Experiments on the RsData remote sensing MOD dataset show that our MOD method based on scattered point denoising can more effectively explore potential relationships between sparse moving objects and improve the detection capability and temporal consistency.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Sketch2Sound can synthesize arbitrary sounds from sonic imitations (i.e.,~a vocal imitation or a reference sound-shape). Sketch2Sound can be implemented on top of any text-to-audio latent diffusion transformer (DiT), and requires only 40k steps of fine-tuning and a single linear layer per control, making it more lightweight than existing methods like ControlNet. To synthesize from sketchlike sonic imitations, we propose applying random median filters to the control signals during training, allowing Sketch2Sound to be prompted using controls with flexible levels of temporal specificity. We show that Sketch2Sound can synthesize sounds that follow the gist of input controls from a vocal imitation while retaining the adherence to an input text prompt and audio quality compared to a text-only baseline. Sketch2Sound allows sound artists to create sounds with the semantic flexibility of text prompts and the expressivity and precision of a sonic gesture or vocal imitation.

In this paper, we introduce RHanDS, a conditional diffusion-based framework designed to refine malformed hands by utilizing decoupled structure and style guidance. The hand mesh reconstructed from the malformed hand offers structure guidance for correcting the structure of the hand, while the malformed hand itself provides style guidance for preserving the style of the hand. To alleviate the mutual interference between style and structure guidance, we introduce a two-stage training strategy and build a series of multi-style hand datasets. In the first stage, we use paired hand images for training to ensure stylistic consistency in hand refining. In the second stage, various hand images generated based on human meshes are used for training, enabling the model to gain control over the hand structure. Experimental results demonstrate that RHanDS can effectively refine hand structure while preserving consistency in hand style.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Decoupled Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems using Data Consistency Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00664v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown strong performances in solving inverse problems through posterior sampling while they suffer from errors during earlier steps. To mitigate this issue, several Decoupled Posterior Sampling methods have been recently proposed. However, the reverse process in these methods ignores measurement information, leading to errors that impede effective optimization in subsequent steps. To solve this problem, we propose Guided Decoupled Posterior Sampling (GDPS) by integrating a data consistency constraint in the reverse process. The constraint performs a smoother transition within the optimization process, facilitating a more effective convergence toward the target distribution. Furthermore, we extend our method to latent diffusion models and Tweedie's formula, demonstrating its scalability. We evaluate GDPS on the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets across various linear and nonlinear tasks under both standard and challenging conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that GDPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we explore the potential of Deep Generative Models (DGMs) in producing synthetic data that satisfies the Generative Learning Trilemma: fidelity, diversity, and sampling efficiency. However, recognizing that these criteria alone are insufficient for practical applications, we extend the trilemma to include utility, robustness, and privacy, factors crucial for ensuring the applicability of DGMs in real-world scenarios. Evaluating these metrics becomes particularly challenging in data-scarce environments, as DGMs traditionally rely on large datasets to perform optimally. This limitation is especially pronounced in domains like medicine and precision agriculture, where ensuring acceptable model performance under data constraints is vital. To address these challenges, we assess the Generative Learning Trilemma in data-scarcity settings using state-of-the-art evaluation metrics, comparing three prominent DGMs: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive framework to assess utility, robustness, and privacy in synthetic data generated by DGMs. Our findings demonstrate varying strengths among DGMs, with each model exhibiting unique advantages based on the application context. This study broadens the scope of the Generative Learning Trilemma, aligning it with real-world demands and providing actionable guidance for selecting DGMs tailored to specific applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Generative Model Training via Embedded Representation Warmup](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10188v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional data but fall short in training efficiency and representation quality compared to self-supervised methods. We identify a key bottleneck: the underutilization of high-quality, semantically rich representations during training notably slows down convergence. Our systematic analysis reveals a critical representation processing region -- primarily in the early layers -- where semantic and structural pattern learning takes place before generation can occur. To address this, we propose Embedded Representation Warmup (ERW), a plug-and-play framework where in the first stage we get the ERW module serves as a warmup that initializes the early layers of the diffusion model with high-quality, pretrained representations. This warmup minimizes the burden of learning representations from scratch, thereby accelerating convergence and boosting performance. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that ERW's efficacy depends on its precise integration into specific neural network layers -- termed the representation processing region -- where the model primarily processes and transforms feature representations for later generation. We further establish that ERW not only accelerates training convergence but also enhances representation quality: empirically, our method achieves a 40$\times$ acceleration in training speed compared to REPA, the current state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/ERW.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical and Step-Layer-Wise Tuning of Attention Specialty for Multi-Instance Synthesis in Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10148v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) generation models often struggle with multi-instance synthesis (MIS), where they must accurately depict multiple distinct instances in a single image based on complex prompts detailing individual features. Traditional MIS control methods for UNet architectures like SD v1.5/SDXL fail to adapt to DiT-based models like FLUX and SD v3.5, which rely on integrated attention between image and text tokens rather than text-image cross-attention. To enhance MIS in DiT, we first analyze the mixed attention mechanism in DiT. Our token-wise and layer-wise analysis of attention maps reveals a hierarchical response structure: instance tokens dominate early layers, background tokens in middle layers, and attribute tokens in later layers. Building on this observation, we propose a training-free approach for enhancing MIS in DiT-based models with hierarchical and step-layer-wise attention specialty tuning (AST). AST amplifies key regions while suppressing irrelevant areas in distinct attention maps across layers and steps, guided by the hierarchical structure. This optimizes multimodal interactions by hierarchically decoupling the complex prompts with instance-based sketches. We evaluate our approach using upgraded sketch-based layouts for the T2I-CompBench and customized complex scenes. Both quantitative and qualitative results confirm our method enhances complex layout generation, ensuring precise instance placement and attribute representation in MIS.</p></details> |  |

However, its convergence order is often reduced to order $1$ for Dirichlet boundary conditions and to order $1.5$ for Neumann and Robin boundary conditions, leading to lower accuracy and reduced efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new splitting approach, called an initial-boundary corrected splitting, which avoids order reduction while improving computational efficiency for a wider range of applications. In contrast to the corrections proposed in the literature, it does not require the computation of correction terms that depend on the boundary conditions and boundary data. Through rigorous analytical convergence analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate the improved accuracy and performance of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we aim to mitigate this challenge by introducing the Heat Conduction Operator (HCO) built upon the physical heat conduction principle. HCO conceptualizes image patches as heat sources and models their correlations through adaptive thermal energy diffusion, enabling robust visual representations. HCO enjoys a computational complexity of O(N^1.5), as it can be implemented using discrete cosine transformation (DCT) operations. HCO is plug-and-play, combining with deep learning backbones produces visual representation models (termed vHeat) with global receptive fields. Experiments across vision tasks demonstrate that, beyond the stronger performance, vHeat achieves up to a 3x throughput, 80% less GPU memory allocation, and 35% fewer computational FLOPs compared to the Swin-Transformer.

Existing methods typically generate short, isolated motions based on a single input sentence. However, human motions are continuous and can extend over long periods, carrying rich semantics. Creating long, complex motions that precisely respond to streams of text descriptions, particularly in an online and real-time setting, remains a significant challenge. Furthermore, incorporating spatial constraints into text-conditioned motion generation presents additional challenges, as it requires aligning the motion semantics specified by text descriptions with geometric information, such as goal locations and 3D scene geometry. To address these limitations, we propose DartControl, in short DART, a Diffusion-based Autoregressive motion primitive model for Real-time Text-driven motion control. Our model effectively learns a compact motion primitive space jointly conditioned on motion history and text inputs using latent diffusion models. By autoregressively generating motion primitives based on the preceding history and current text input, DART enables real-time, sequential motion generation driven by natural language descriptions. Additionally, the learned motion primitive space allows for precise spatial motion control, which we formulate either as a latent noise optimization problem or as a Markov decision process addressed through reinforcement learning. We present effective algorithms for both approaches, demonstrating our model's versatility and superior performance in various motion synthesis tasks. Experiments show our method outperforms existing baselines in motion realism, efficiency, and controllability.

Iterative methods in the first class are computationally costly and often provide suboptimal reconstruction performance, whereas unrolled architectures are generally specific to a single inverse problem and require expensive training. In this work, we propose a novel non-iterative, lightweight architecture that incorporates knowledge about the forward operator (acquisition physics and noise parameters) without relying on unrolling. Our model is trained to solve a wide range of inverse problems beyond denoising, including deblurring, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, inpainting, and super-resolution. The proposed model can be easily adapted to unseen inverse problems or datasets with a few fine-tuning steps (up to a few images) in a self-supervised way, without ground-truth references. Throughout a series of experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance from medical imaging to low-photon imaging and microscopy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prior Does Matter: Visual Navigation via Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10041v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion-based imitation learning, which show impressive performance in modeling multimodal distributions and training stability, have led to substantial progress in various robot learning tasks. In visual navigation, previous diffusion-based policies typically generate action sequences by initiating from denoising Gaussian noise. However, the target action distribution often diverges significantly from Gaussian noise, leading to redundant denoising steps and increased learning complexity. Additionally, the sparsity of effective action distributions makes it challenging for the policy to generate accurate actions without guidance. To address these issues, we propose a novel, unified visual navigation framework leveraging the denoising diffusion bridge models named NaviBridger. This approach enables action generation by initiating from any informative prior actions, enhancing guidance and efficiency in the denoising process. We explore how diffusion bridges can enhance imitation learning in visual navigation tasks and further examine three source policies for generating prior actions. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios demonstrate that NaviBridger accelerates policy inference and outperforms the baselines in generating target action sequences.

A wide variety of methodologies for inpainting MRI have been proposed and demonstrated on tasks including anomaly detection. In this work we investigate the statistical relationship between inpainted brain structures and the amount of subject-specific conditioning information, i.e. the other areas of the image that are masked. In particular, we analyse the distribution of inpainting results when masking additional regions of the image, specifically the contra-lateral structure. This allows us to elucidate where in the brain the model is drawing information from, and in particular, what is the importance of hemispherical symmetry? Our experiments interrogate a diffusion inpainting model through analysing the inpainting of subcortical brain structures based on intensity and estimated area change. We demonstrate that some structures show a strong influence of symmetry in the conditioning of the inpainting process.</p></details> |  |

This process is a generalization of various models in econometrics, such as Vasicek model, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, and Black-Scholes, allowing for the presence of several thresholds which determine changes in the dynamics. We study the asymptotic behavior of maximum-likelihood and quasi-maximum-likelihood estimators of the drift parameters in the case of continuous time and discrete time observations. We show that for high frequency observations and infinite horizon the estimators satisfy the same asymptotic normality property as in the case of continuous time observations. We also discuss diffusion coefficient estimation. Finally, we apply our estimators to simulated and real data to motivate considering (multiple) thresholds.</p></details> |  |
| **[NaviDiffusor: Cost-Guided Diffusion Model for Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10003v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual navigation, a fundamental challenge in mobile robotics, demands versatile policies to handle diverse environments. Classical methods leverage geometric solutions to minimize specific costs, offering adaptability to new scenarios but are prone to system errors due to their multi-modular design and reliance on hand-crafted rules. Learning-based methods, while achieving high planning success rates, face difficulties in generalizing to unseen environments beyond the training data and often require extensive training. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of learning-based methods and classical approaches for RGB-only visual navigation. Our method first trains a conditional diffusion model on diverse path-RGB observation pairs. During inference, it integrates the gradients of differentiable scene-specific and task-level costs, guiding the diffusion model to generate valid paths that meet the constraints. This approach alleviates the need for retraining, offering a plug-and-play solution. Extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor settings, across simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrate zero-shot transfer capability of our approach, achieving higher success rates and fewer collisions compared to baseline methods. Code will be released at https://github.com/SYSU-RoboticsLab/NaviD.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPC: Test-time Procrustes Calibration for Diffusion-based Human Image Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24037v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human image animation aims to generate a human motion video from the inputs of a reference human image and a target motion video. Current diffusion-based image animation systems exhibit high precision in transferring human identity into targeted motion, yet they still exhibit irregular quality in their outputs. Their optimal precision is achieved only when the physical compositions (i.e., scale and rotation) of the human shapes in the reference image and target pose frame are aligned. In the absence of such alignment, there is a noticeable decline in fidelity and consistency. Especially, in real-world environments, this compositional misalignment commonly occurs, posing significant challenges to the practical usage of current systems. To this end, we propose Test-time Procrustes Calibration (TPC), which enhances the robustness of diffusion-based image animation systems by maintaining optimal performance even when faced with compositional misalignment, effectively addressing real-world scenarios. The TPC provides a calibrated reference image for the diffusion model, enhancing its capability to understand the correspondence between human shapes in the reference and target images. Our method is simple and can be applied to any diffusion-based image animation system in a model-agnostic manner, improving the effectiveness at test time without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 16 figures, NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Semi-implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta method for nonlinear differential equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09969v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A semi-implicit-explicit (semi-IMEX) Runge-Kutta (RK) method is proposed for the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form $\mathbf{u}' = \mathbf{f}(t,\mathbf{u}) + G(t,\mathbf{u}) \mathbf{u}$, where $\mathbf{f}$ is a non-stiff term and $G\mathbf{u}$ represents the stiff terms. Such systems frequently arise from spatial discretizations of time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). For instance, $G$ could involve higher-order derivative terms with nonlinear coefficients. Traditional IMEX-RK methods, which treat $\mathbf{f}$ explicitly and $G\mathbf{u}$ implicitly, require solving nonlinear systems at each time step when $G$ depends on $\mathbf{u}$, leading to increased computational cost and complexity. In contrast, the proposed semi-IMEX scheme treats $G$ explicitly while keeping $\mathbf{u}$ implicit, reducing the problem to solving only linear systems. This approach eliminates the need to compute Jacobians while preserving the stability advantages of implicit methods. A family of semi-IMEX RK schemes with varying orders of accuracy is introduced. Numerical simulations for various nonlinear equations, including nonlinear diffusion models, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Cahn-Hilliard equation, confirm the expected convergence rates and demonstrate that the proposed method allows for larger time step sizes without triggering stability issues.</p></details> |  |

The controllability challenges include generating a motion of a length that matches the given textual description and editing the generated motions according to control signals, such as the start-end positions and the pelvis trajectory. In this paper, we propose MoLA, which provides fast, high-quality, variable-length motion generation and can also deal with multiple editing tasks in a single framework. Our approach revisits the motion representation used as inputs and outputs in the model, incorporating an activation variable to enable variable-length motion generation. Additionally, we integrate a variational autoencoder and a latent diffusion model, further enhanced through adversarial training, to achieve high-quality and fast generation. Moreover, we apply a training-free guided generation framework to achieve various editing tasks with motion control inputs. We quantitatively show the effectiveness of adversarial learning in text-to-motion generation, and demonstrate the applicability of our editing framework to multiple editing tasks in the motion domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 HuMoGen Workshop</p></details> |

However, local video editing, particularly removal of small attributes like glasses, remains a challenge. Existing methods either alter the videos excessively, generate unrealistic artifacts, or fail to perform the requested edit consistently throughout the video. In this work, we focus on consistent and identity-preserving removal of glasses in videos, using it as a case study for consistent local attribute removal in videos. Due to the lack of paired data, we adopt a weakly supervised approach and generate synthetic imperfect data, using an adjusted pretrained diffusion model. We show that despite data imperfection, by learning from our generated data and leveraging the prior of pretrained diffusion models, our model is able to perform the desired edit consistently while preserving the original video content. Furthermore, we exemplify the generalization ability of our method to other local video editing tasks by applying it successfully to facial sticker-removal. Our approach demonstrates significant improvement over existing methods, showcasing the potential of leveraging synthetic data and strong video priors for local video editing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bundle Neural Networks for message diffusion on graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15540v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant paradigm for learning on graph-structured data is message passing. Despite being a strong inductive bias, the local message passing mechanism suffers from pathological issues such as over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited node-level expressivity. To address these limitations we propose Bundle Neural Networks (BuNN), a new type of GNN that operates via message diffusion over flat vector bundles - structures analogous to connections on Riemannian manifolds that augment the graph by assigning to each node a vector space and an orthogonal map. A BuNN layer evolves the features according to a diffusion-type partial differential equation. When discretized, BuNNs are a special case of Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs), a recently proposed MPNN capable of mitigating over-smoothing. The continuous nature of message diffusion enables BuNNs to operate on larger scales of the graph and, therefore, to mitigate over-squashing. Finally, we prove that BuNN can approximate any feature transformation over nodes on any (potentially infinite) family of graphs given injective positional encodings, resulting in universal node-level expressivity. We support our theory via synthetic experiments and showcase the strong empirical performance of BuNNs over a range of real-world tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on several standard benchmarks in transductive and inductive settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Task-specific Conditional Diffusion Policies: Shortcut Model Acceleration and SO(3) Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09927v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning, particularly Diffusion Policies based methods, has recently gained significant traction in embodied AI as a powerful approach to action policy generation. These models efficiently generate action policies by learning to predict noise. However, conventional Diffusion Policy methods rely on iterative denoising, leading to inefficient inference and slow response times, which hinder real-time robot control. To address these limitations, we propose a Classifier-Free Shortcut Diffusion Policy (CF-SDP) that integrates classifier-free guidance with shortcut-based acceleration, enabling efficient task-specific action generation while significantly improving inference speed. Furthermore, we extend diffusion modeling to the SO(3) manifold in shortcut model, defining the forward and reverse processes in its tangent space with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. This ensures stable and accurate rotational estimation, enhancing the effectiveness of diffusion-based control. Our approach achieves nearly 5x acceleration in diffusion inference compared to DDIM-based Diffusion Policy while maintaining task performance. Evaluations both on the RoboTwin simulation platform and real-world scenarios across various tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 Workshop on 2nd MEIS</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to UGC image super-resolution by integrating semantic guidance into a diffusion framework. Our method addresses the inconsistency between degradations in wild and synthetic datasets by separately simulating the degradation processes on the LSDIR dataset and combining them with the official paired training set. Furthermore, we enhance degradation removal and detail generation by incorporating a pretrained semantic extraction model (SAM2) and fine-tuning key hyperparameters for improved perceptual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the proposed model won second place in the CVPR NTIRE 2025 Short-form UGC Image Super-Resolution Challenge, further validating its effectiveness.

| **[Separate to Collaborate: Dual-Stream Diffusion Model for Coordinated Piano Hand Motion Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09885v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating the synthesis of coordinated bimanual piano performances poses significant challenges, particularly in capturing the intricate choreography between the hands while preserving their distinct kinematic signatures. In this paper, we propose a dual-stream neural framework designed to generate synchronized hand gestures for piano playing from audio input, addressing the critical challenge of modeling both hand independence and coordination. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (i) a decoupled diffusion-based generation framework that independently models each hand's motion via dual-noise initialization, sampling distinct latent noise for each while leveraging a shared positional condition, and (ii) a Hand-Coordinated Asymmetric Attention (HCAA) mechanism suppresses symmetric (common-mode) noise to highlight asymmetric hand-specific features, while adaptively enhancing inter-hand coordination during denoising. The system operates hierarchically: it first predicts 3D hand positions from audio features and then generates joint angles through position-aware diffusion models, where parallel denoising streams interact via HCAA. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Adaptive teachers for amortized samplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01432v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amortized inference is the task of training a parametric model, such as a neural network, to approximate a distribution with a given unnormalized density where exact sampling is intractable. When sampling is implemented as a sequential decision-making process, reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as generative flow networks, can be used to train the sampling policy. Off-policy RL training facilitates the discovery of diverse, high-reward candidates, but existing methods still face challenges in efficient exploration. We propose to use an adaptive training distribution (the \teacher) to guide the training of the primary amortized sampler (the \student). The \teacher, an auxiliary behavior model, is trained to sample high-loss regions of the \student and can generalize across unexplored modes, thereby enhancing mode coverage by providing an efficient training curriculum. We validate the effectiveness of this approach in a synthetic environment designed to present an exploration challenge, two diffusion-based sampling tasks, and four biochemical discovery tasks demonstrating its ability to improve sample efficiency and mode coverage.

An explicit upper bound is derived for the total variation distance between the distribution of the discrete-time DDPM sampling algorithm and a target data distribution, under general noise schedule parameters. The analysis assumes certain technical conditions on the data distribution and a linear growth condition on the noise estimation function. The sampling sequence emerges as an exponential integrator-type approximation of a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE) over a finite time interval. Schr\"odinger's problem provides a tool for estimating the distributional error in reverse time, which connects the reverse-time error with its forward-time counterpart. The score function in DDPMs appears as an adapted solution of a forward-backward SDE, providing a foundation for analyzing the time-discretization error associated with the reverse-time SDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Subst...</summary><p>Substantial changes have been made in this version</p></details> |
| **[Score Matching Diffusion Based Feedback Control and Planning of Nonlinear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09836v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel control-theoretic framework that leverages principles from generative modeling -- specifically, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) -- to stabilize control-affine systems with nonholonomic constraints. Unlike traditional stochastic approaches, which rely on noise-driven dynamics in both forward and reverse processes, our method crucially eliminates the need for noise in the reverse phase, making it particularly relevant for control applications. We introduce two formulations: one where noise perturbs all state dimensions during the forward phase while the control system enforces time reversal deterministically, and another where noise is restricted to the control channels, embedding system constraints directly into the forward process. For controllable nonlinear drift-free systems, we prove that deterministic feedback laws can exactly reverse the forward process, ensuring that the system's probability density evolves correctly without requiring artificial diffusion in the reverse phase. Furthermore, for linear time-invariant systems, we establish a time-reversal result under the second formulation. By eliminating noise in the backward process, our approach provides a more practical alternative to machine learning-based denoising methods, which are unsuitable for control applications due to the presence of stochasticity. We validate our results through numerical simulations on benchmark systems, including a unicycle model in a domain with obstacles, a driftless five-dimensional system, and a four-dimensional linear system, demonstrating the potential for applying diffusion-inspired techniques in linear, nonlinear, and settings with state space constraints.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works are primarily limited to single-subject oriented text-to-video generation, leaving the more challenging problem of customized multi-subject generation unexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose a novel VideoDreamer framework, which can generate temporally consistent text-guided videos that faithfully preserve the visual features of the given multiple subjects. Specifically, VideoDreamer adopts the pretrained Stable Diffusion with temporal modules as its base video generator, taking the power of the text-to-image model to generate diversified content. The video generator is further customized for multi-subjects, which leverages the proposed Disen-Mix Finetuning and Human-in-the-Loop Re-finetuning strategy, to tackle the attribute binding problem of multi-subject generation. Additionally, we present a disentangled motion customization strategy to finetune the temporal modules so that we can generate videos with both customized subjects and motions. To evaluate the performance of customized multi-subject text-to-video generation, we introduce the MultiStudioBench benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable ability of VideoDreamer to generate videos with new content such as new events and backgrounds, tailored to the customized multiple subjects.</p></details> |  |

We show that the standard training objective of diffusion models, when applied with temporally consistent noise, encourages the model to be equivariant to spatial transformations in input video and noise. This enables our model to better follow motion patterns from the input video, producing aligned motion and high-fidelity frames. Furthermore, we extend our approach to 3D-consistent video generation by attaching noise as textures on 3D meshes, ensuring 3D consistency in sim-to-real applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in motion alignment, 3D consistency, and video quality while requiring only a few sampling steps in practice.</p></details> |  |

At each time step during diffusion denoising, our algorithm forecasts predictions w.r.t. the generated image and makes informed text conditioning decisions. Central to our method is the unique analogy between diffusion models, which are rooted in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and the Black-Scholes model for financial option pricing. By drawing parallels between key variables in both domains, we derive a robust algorithm for concept blending that capitalizes on the Markovian dynamics of the Black-Scholes framework. Our text-based concept blending algorithm is data-efficient, meaning it does not need additional training. Furthermore, it operates without human intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We highlight the benefits of our approach by comparing it qualitatively and quantitatively to other text based concept blending techniques, including linear interpolation, alternating prompts, step-wise prompt switching, and CLIP-guided prompt selection across various scenarios such as single object per text prompt, multiple objects per text prompt and objects against backgrounds. Our work shows that financially inspired techniques can enhance text-to-image concept blending in generative AI, paving the way for broader innovation.

| **[ID-Booth: Identity-consistent Face Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07392v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data that is applicable in a variety of domains, including face recognition. Here, state-of-the-art generative models typically rely on conditioning and fine-tuning of powerful pretrained diffusion models to facilitate the synthesis of realistic images of a desired identity. Yet, these models often do not consider the identity of subjects during training, leading to poor consistency between generated and intended identities. In contrast, methods that employ identity-based training objectives tend to overfit on various aspects of the identity, and in turn, lower the diversity of images that can be generated. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel generative diffusion-based framework, called ID-Booth. ID-Booth consists of a denoising network responsible for data generation, a variational auto-encoder for mapping images to and from a lower-dimensional latent space and a text encoder that allows for prompt-based control over the generation procedure. The framework utilizes a novel triplet identity training objective and enables identity-consistent image generation while retaining the synthesis capabilities of pretrained diffusion models. Experiments with a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model and diverse prompts reveal that our method facilitates better intra-identity consistency and inter-identity separability than competing methods, while achieving higher image diversity. In turn, the produced data allows for effective augmentation of small-scale datasets and training of better-performing recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner. The source code for the ID-Booth framework is publicly available at https://github.com/dariant/ID-Booth.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG) 2025, 14 pages</p></details> |

By synergizing the strengths of a base diffusion model and a Canny edge ControlNet model, SPICE robustly handles free-form editing instructions from the user. SPICE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a challenging realistic image-editing dataset consisting of semantic editing (object addition, removal, replacement, and background change), stylistic editing (texture changes), and structural editing (action change) tasks. Not only does SPICE achieve the highest quantitative performance according to standard evaluation metrics, but it is also consistently preferred by users over existing image-editing methods.

Videos with dramatic motions often require a higher frame rate to ensure smooth motion. Currently, most audio-to-visual animation models use uniformly sampled frames from video clips. However, these uniformly sampled frames fail to capture significant key moments in dramatic motions at low frame rates and require significantly more memory when increasing the number of frames directly. In this paper, we propose KeyVID, a keyframe-aware audio-to-visual animation framework that significantly improves the generation quality for key moments in audio signals while maintaining computation efficiency. Given an image and an audio input, we first localize keyframe time steps from the audio. Then, we use a keyframe generator to generate the corresponding visual keyframes. Finally, we generate all intermediate frames using the motion interpolator. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that KeyVID significantly improves audio-video synchronization and video quality across multiple datasets, particularly for highly dynamic motions.

In this paper, we propose EB-Diff-Train, a new efficient DM training approach that is orthogonal to other methods of accelerating DM training, by investigating and leveraging Early-Bird (EB) tickets -- sparse subnetworks that manifest early in the training process and maintain high generation quality. We first investigate the existence of traditional EB tickets in DMs, enabling competitive generation quality without fully training a dense model. Then, we delve into the concept of diffusion-dedicated EB tickets, drawing on insights from varying importance of different timestep regions. These tickets adapt their sparsity levels according to the importance of corresponding timestep regions, allowing for aggressive sparsity during non-critical regions while conserving computational resources for crucial timestep regions. Building on this, we develop an efficient DM training technique that derives timestep-aware EB tickets, trains them in parallel, and combines them during inference for image generation. Extensive experiments validate the existence of both traditional and timestep-aware EB tickets, as well as the effectiveness of our proposed EB-Diff-Train method. This approach can significantly reduce training time both spatially and temporally -- achieving 2.9$\times$ to 5.8$\times$ speedups over training unpruned dense models, and up to 10.3$\times$ faster training compared to standard train-prune-finetune pipelines -- without compromising generative quality.

We show that the approximations produced by existing methods are relatively poor, especially early in the reverse process, and so we propose a new approach that iteratively reestimates and "renoises" the estimate several times per diffusion step. This iterative approach, which we call Fast Iterative REnoising (FIRE), injects colored noise that is shaped to ensure that the pre-trained diffusion model always sees white noise, in accordance with how it was trained. We then embed FIRE into the DDIM reverse process and show that the resulting "DDfire" offers state-of-the-art accuracy and runtime on several linear inverse problems, as well as phase retrieval.

However, while many methods focus on geometric consistency, they often neglect the potential of text-driven guidance to enhance semantic understanding, which is crucial for accurately reconstructing fine-grained details in complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose TextSplat--the first text-driven Generalizable Gaussian Splatting framework. By employing a text-guided fusion of diverse semantic cues, our framework learns robust cross-modal feature representations that improve the alignment of geometric and semantic information, producing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. Specifically, our framework employs three parallel modules to obtain complementary representations: the Diffusion Prior Depth Estimator for accurate depth information, the Semantic Aware Segmentation Network for detailed semantic information, and the Multi-View Interaction Network for refined cross-view features. Then, in the Text-Guided Semantic Fusion Module, these representations are integrated via the text-guided and attention-based feature aggregation mechanism, resulting in enhanced 3D Gaussian parameters enriched with detailed semantic cues. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Long-tail Distribution in Oracle Bone Inscriptions: Dataset, Model, and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09555v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The oracle bone inscription (OBI) recognition plays a significant role in understanding the history and culture of ancient China. However, the existing OBI datasets suffer from a long-tail distribution problem, leading to biased performance of OBI recognition models across majority and minority classes. With recent advancements in generative models, OBI synthesis-based data augmentation has become a promising avenue to expand the sample size of minority classes. Unfortunately, current OBI datasets lack large-scale structure-aligned image pairs for generative model training. To address these problems, we first present the Oracle-P15K, a structure-aligned OBI dataset for OBI generation and denoising, consisting of 14,542 images infused with domain knowledge from OBI experts. Second, we propose a diffusion model-based pseudo OBI generator, called OBIDiff, to achieve realistic and controllable OBI generation. Given a clean glyph image and a target rubbing-style image, it can effectively transfer the noise style of the original rubbing to the glyph image. Extensive experiments on OBI downstream tasks and user preference studies show the effectiveness of the proposed Oracle-P15K dataset and demonstrate that OBIDiff can accurately preserve inherent glyph structures while transferring authentic rubbing styles effectively.</p></details> |  |

Previous works focus on designing discriminative ReID models to maintain identity consistency despite drastic changes in camera viewpoints. The core idea behind these methods is quite natural, but designing a view-robust network is a very challenging task. Moreover, they overlook the contribution of view-specific features in enhancing the model's capability to represent persons. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage feature learning framework named SD-ReID for AG-ReID, which takes advantage of the powerful understanding capacity of generative models, e.g., Stable Diffusion (SD), to generate view-specific features between different viewpoints. In the first stage, we train a simple ViT-based model to extract coarse-grained representations and controllable conditions. Then, in the second stage, we fine-tune the SD model to learn complementary representations guided by the controllable conditions. Furthermore, we propose the View-Refine Decoder (VRD) to obtain additional controllable conditions to generate missing cross-view features. Finally, we use the coarse-grained representations and all-view features generated by SD to retrieve target persons. Extensive experiments on the AG-ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SD-ReID. The source code will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Modification, when integrated, must be smooth and subtle, preserving the natural flow and aligning seamlessly with the original vision. Therefore, our primary focus is on overcoming the current challenges in high quality edit to ensure that each edit enhances the final product without disrupting its intended essence. However, quality deterioration such as blurring and flickering is routinely observed in recent diffusion video editing systems. We confirm that this deterioration often stems from high-frequency leak: the diffusion model fails to accurately synthesize high-frequency components during denoising process. To this end, we devise Frequency Adapting Group (FRAG) which enhances the video quality in terms of consistency and fidelity by introducing a novel receptive field branch to preserve high-frequency components during the denoising process. FRAG is performed in a model-agnostic manner without additional training and validates the effectiveness on video editing benchmarks (i.e., TGVE, DAVIS).</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures, ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion-Based Approximate MPC: Fast and Consistent Imitation of Multi-Modal Action Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04603v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximating model predictive control (MPC) using imitation learning (IL) allows for fast control without solving expensive optimization problems online. However, methods that use neural networks in a simple L2-regression setup fail to approximate multi-modal (set-valued) solution distributions caused by local optima found by the numerical solver or non-convex constraints, such as obstacles, significantly limiting the applicability of approximate MPC in practice. We solve this issue by using diffusion models to accurately represent the complete solution distribution (i.e., all modes) at high control rates (more than 1000 Hz). This work shows that diffusion based AMPC significantly outperforms L2-regression-based approximate MPC for multi-modal action distributions. In contrast to most earlier work on IL, we also focus on running the diffusion-based controller at a higher rate and in joint space instead of end-effector space. Additionally, we propose the use of gradient guidance during the denoising process to consistently pick the same mode in closed loop to prevent switching between solutions. We propose using the cost and constraint satisfaction of the original MPC problem during parallel sampling of solutions from the diffusion model to pick a better mode online. We evaluate our method on the fast and accurate control of a 7-DoF robot manipulator both in simulation and on hardware deployed at 250 Hz, achieving a speedup of more than 70 times compared to solving the MPC problem online and also outperforming the numerical optimization (used for training) in success ratio.

However, restoration of ancient murals, as an important downstream task in this field, poses significant challenges to diffusion model-based restoration methods due to its large defective area and scarce training samples. Conditional restoration tasks are more concerned with whether the restored part meets the aesthetic standards of mural restoration in terms of overall style and seam detail, and such metrics for evaluating heuristic image complements are lacking in current research. We therefore propose DiffuMural, a combined Multi-scale convergence and Collaborative Diffusion mechanism with ControlNet and cyclic consistency loss to optimise the matching between the generated images and the conditional control. DiffuMural demonstrates outstanding capabilities in mural restoration, leveraging training data from 23 large-scale Dunhuang murals that exhibit consistent visual aesthetics. The model excels in restoring intricate details, achieving a coherent overall appearance, and addressing the unique challenges posed by incomplete murals lacking factual grounding. Our evaluation framework incorporates four key metrics to quantitatively assess incomplete murals: factual accuracy, textural detail, contextual semantics, and holistic visual coherence. Furthermore, we integrate humanistic value assessments to ensure the restored murals retain their cultural and artistic significance. Extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.</p></details> |  |

Existing image protection methods, though effective, struggle to balance protection efficacy, invisibility, and latency, thus limiting practical use. We introduce perturbation pre-training to reduce latency and propose a mixture-of-perturbations approach that dynamically adapts to input images to minimize performance degradation. Our novel training strategy computes protection loss across multiple VAE feature spaces, while adaptive targeted protection at inference enhances robustness and invisibility. Experiments show comparable protection performance with improved invisibility and drastically reduced inference time.

| **[AB-Cache: Training-Free Acceleration of Diffusion Models via Adams-Bashforth Cached Feature Reuse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10540v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generative tasks, yet their iterative denoising process results in slow inference, limiting their practicality. While existing acceleration methods exploit the well-known U-shaped similarity pattern between adjacent steps through caching mechanisms, they lack theoretical foundation and rely on simplistic computation reuse, often leading to performance degradation. In this work, we provide a theoretical understanding by analyzing the denoising process through the second-order Adams-Bashforth method, revealing a linear relationship between the outputs of consecutive steps. This analysis explains why the outputs of adjacent steps exhibit a U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, extending Adams-Bashforth method to higher order, we propose a novel caching-based acceleration approach for diffusion models, instead of directly reusing cached results, with a truncation error bound of only \(O(h^k)\) where $h$ is the step size. Extensive validation across diverse image and video diffusion models (including HunyuanVideo and FLUX.1-dev) with various schedulers demonstrates our method's effectiveness in achieving nearly $3\times$ speedup while maintaining original performance levels, offering a practical real-time solution without compromising generation quality.</p></details> |  |

Interface diffusion is a common challenge in multiphase LBM, leading to reduced accuracy in simulating phenomena where interfacial dynamics are critical. We propose a coupled PINN-LBM framework that maintains interface sharpness while preserving the physical accuracy of the simulation. Our approach is validated through droplet simulations, with quantitative metrics measuring interface width, maximum gradient, phase separation, effective interface width, and interface energy. The enhanced visualization techniques employed in this work clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PINN-LBM over standard LBM for multiphase simulations, particularly in maintaining well-defined interfaces throughout the simulation. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the results, showcasing how the neural network integration effectively counteracts numerical diffusion, while maintaining physical consistency with the underlying fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |

It is designed to seamlessly transfer the camera motion observed in a given reference video onto any scene of the user's choice in a zero-shot manner without requiring any additional data. Our algorithm achieves this using a two-phase strategy by leveraging a text-to-video diffusion model. In the first phase, we develop a multi-concept learning method using a combination of LoRA layers and an orthogonality loss to capture and understand the underlying spatial-temporal characteristics of the reference video as well as the spatial features of the user's desired scene. The second phase proposes a unique homography-based refinement strategy to enhance the temporal and spatial alignment of the generated video. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through experiments conducted on a dataset containing combinations of diverse scenes and reference videos containing a variety of camera motions. In the absence of an established metric for assessing camera motion transfer between unrelated scenes, we propose CameraScore, a novel metric that utilizes homography representations to measure camera motion similarity between the reference and generated videos. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach generates high-quality, motion-enhanced videos. Additionally, a user study reveals that 70.31% of participants preferred our method for scene preservation, while 90.45% favored it for motion transfer. We hope this work lays the foundation for future advancements in camera motion transfer across different scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient cell-centered nodal integral method for multi-dimensional Burgers equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19079v3)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An efficient coarse-mesh nodal integral method (NIM), based on cell-centered variables and termed the cell-centered NIM (CCNIM), is developed and applied to solve multi-dimensional, time-dependent, nonlinear Burgers equations, extending the applicability of CCNIM to nonlinear problems. To overcome the existing limitation of CCNIM to linear problems, the convective velocity in the nonlinear convection term is approximated using two different approaches, both demonstrating accuracy comparable to or better than traditional NIM for nonlinear Burgers problems. Unlike traditional NIM, which utilizes surface-averaged variables as discrete unknowns, this innovative approach formulates the final expression of the numerical scheme using discrete unknowns represented by cell-centered (or node-averaged) variables. Using these cell centroids, the proposed CCNIM approach presents several advantages compared to traditional NIM. These include a simplified implementation process in terms of local coordinate systems, enhanced flexibility regarding the higher order of accuracy in time, straightforward formulation for higher-degree temporal derivatives, and offering a viable option for coupling with other physics. The multi-dimensional time-dependent Burgers problems (propagating shock, propagation, and diffusion of an initial sinusoidal wave, shock-like formation) with known analytical solutions are solved in order to validate the developed scheme. Furthermore, a detailed comparison between the proposed CCNIM approach and other traditional NIM schemes is conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness. The proposed approach has shown quadratic convergence in both space and time, i.e., O[$(\Delta x)^2, (\Delta t)^2$], for the considered test problems. The simplicity and robustness of the approach provide a strong foundation for its seamless extension to more complex fluid flow problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 21 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Despite the excellent performance and scalability of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, it applies fixed compression across different image regions during the diffusion process, disregarding the naturally varying information densities present in these regions. However, large compression leads to limited local realism, while small compression increases computational complexity and compromises global consistency, ultimately impacting the quality of generated images. To address these limitations, we propose dynamically compressing different image regions by recognizing the importance of different regions, and introduce a novel two-stage framework designed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of image generation: (1) Dynamic VAE (DVAE) at first stage employs a hierarchical encoder to encode different image regions at different downsampling rates, tailored to their specific information densities, thereby providing more accurate and natural latent codes for the diffusion process. (2) Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (D$^2$iT) at second stage generates images by predicting multi-grained noise, consisting of coarse-grained (less latent code in smooth regions) and fine-grained (more latent codes in detailed regions), through an novel combination of the Dynamic Grain Transformer and the Dynamic Content Transformer. The strategy of combining rough prediction of noise with detailed regions correction achieves a unification of global consistency and local realism. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be released at https://github.com/jiawn-creator/Dynamic-DiT.</p></details> |  |

This transformation-based doubly-adaptive quasi-Milstein scheme is the first scheme that has strong convergence rate $1$ in $L^p$ for $p\in[1,\infty)$ with respect to the average computational cost for these SDEs. To obtain our result, we prove that under slightly stronger assumptions which are still weaker than those in existing literature, a related doubly-adaptive quasi-Milstein scheme has convergence order $1$. This scheme is doubly-adaptive in the sense that it is jump-adapted, i.e.~all jump times of the Poisson noise are grid points, and it includes an adaptive stepsize strategy to account for the discontinuities of the drift.</p></details> |  |

However, due to compute limitations, each inference with these large models is confined to a small area, making long-range consistent scene generation challenging. To address this, we propose StarGen, a novel framework that employs a pre-trained video diffusion model in an autoregressive manner for long-range scene generation. The generation of each video clip is conditioned on the 3D warping of spatially adjacent images and the temporally overlapping image from previously generated clips, improving spatiotemporal consistency in long-range scene generation with precise pose control. The spatiotemporal condition is compatible with various input conditions, facilitating diverse tasks, including sparse view interpolation, perpetual view generation, and layout-conditioned city generation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate StarGen's superior scalability, fidelity, and pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Rethinking Diffusion Model in High Dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08643v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curse of Dimensionality is an unavoidable challenge in statistical probability models, yet diffusion models seem to overcome this limitation, achieving impressive results in high-dimensional data generation. Diffusion models assume that they can learn the statistical properties of the underlying probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate realistic samples. But is this really how they work? To address this question, this paper conducts a detailed analysis of the objective function and inference methods of diffusion models, leading to several important conclusions that help answer the above question: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the target of the objective function fitting degrades from a weighted sum of multiple samples to a single sample. 2) The mainstream inference methods can all be represented within a simple unified framework, without requiring statistical concepts such as Markov chains and SDE, while aligning with the degraded objective function. 3) Guided by this simple framework, more efficient inference methods can be discovered.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Wasserstein Convergence and Straightness of Rectified Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14949v6)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for image generation and denoising. Typically, generative models learn a trajectory between the starting noise distribution and the target data distribution. Recently Liu et al. (2023b) proposed Rectified Flow (RF), a generative model that aims to learn straight flow trajectories from noise to data using a sequence of convex optimization problems with close ties to optimal transport. If the trajectory is curved, one must use many Euler discretization steps or novel strategies, such as exponential integrators, to achieve a satisfactory generation quality. In contrast, RF has been shown to theoretically straighten the trajectory through successive rectifications, reducing the number of function evaluations (NFEs) while sampling. It has also been shown empirically that RF may improve the straightness in two rectifications if one can solve the underlying optimization problem within a sufficiently small error. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we provide a theoretical analysis of the Wasserstein distance between the sampling distribution of RF and the target distribution. Our error rate is characterized by the number of discretization steps and a novel formulation of straightness stronger than that in the original work. Secondly, we present general conditions guaranteeing uniqueness and straightness of 1-RF, which is in line with previous empirical findings. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show that, in one dimension, RF started at the standard Gaussian distribution yields the Monge map. Additionally, we also present empirical results on both simulated and real datasets to validate our theoretical findings.

Diffusion model is a powerful strategy to synthesize the required medical images. However, existing approaches still suffer from the problem of anatomical structure distortion due to the overfitting of high-frequency information and the weakening of low-frequency information. Thus, we propose a novel method based on dynamic frequency balance and knowledge guidance. Specifically, we first extract the low-frequency and high-frequency components by decomposing the critical features of the model using wavelet transform. Then, a dynamic frequency balance module is designed to adaptively adjust frequency for enhancing global low-frequency features and effective high-frequency details as well as suppressing high-frequency noise. To further overcome the challenges posed by the large differences between different medical modalities, we construct a knowledge-guided mechanism that fuses the prior clinical knowledge from a visual language model with visual features, to facilitate the generation of accurate anatomical structures. Experimental evaluations on multiple datasets show the proposed method achieves significant improvements in qualitative and quantitative assessments, verifying its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical image translation, Diffusion model, 16 pages</p></details> |

This variability necessitates the deployment of advanced computational methods to integrate and interpret these diverse datasets within a cohesive analytical framework. In our research, we amalgamate functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural MRI into a cohesive framework. This integration capitalizes on the unique strengths of each modality and their inherent interconnections, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the brain's connectivity and anatomical characteristics. Utilizing the Glasser atlas for parcellation, we integrate imaging derived features from various modalities: functional connectivity from fMRI, structural connectivity from DTI, and anatomical features from sMRI within consistent regions. Our approach incorporates a masking strategy to differentially weight neural connections, thereby facilitating a holistic amalgamation of multimodal imaging data. This technique enhances interpretability at connectivity level, transcending traditional analyses centered on singular regional attributes. The model is applied to the Human Connectome Project's Development study to elucidate the associations between multimodal imaging and cognitive functions throughout youth. The analysis demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and uncovers crucial anatomical features and essential neural connections, deepening our understanding of brain structure and function.</p></details> |  |

VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs. Extensive experiments underscores that our VarFormer outperforms existing multi-task image restoration methods across various restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

In Stage 1, a character-agnostic diffusion model synthesizes transitions from sparse keyframes on a canonical skeleton, allowing the same model to generalize across diverse characters. In Stage 2, a reinforcement learning-based controller adapts the canonical motion to the target character's morphology and dynamics, correcting artifacts and enhancing stylistic realism. This design supports scalable motion generation across characters with diverse skeletons without retraining the entire model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and stylized characters demonstrate that our method produces physically plausible, style-consistent motions under sparse and long-range constraints.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion-based generative augmentation approaches present a promising solution to this issue, having been proven effective in advancing downstream medical recognition tasks. Nevertheless, existing works lack sufficient semantic and sequential steerability for challenging video/3D sequence generation, and neglect quality control of noisy synthesized samples, resulting in unreliable synthetic databases and severely limiting the performance of downstream tasks. In this work, we present Ctrl-GenAug, a novel and general generative augmentation framework that enables highly semantic- and sequential-customized sequence synthesis and suppresses incorrectly synthesized samples, to aid medical sequence classification.

A sequential augmentation module is integrated to enhance the temporal/stereoscopic coherence of generated samples. Then, we propose a noisy synthetic data filter to suppress unreliable cases at semantic and sequential levels.

Speech enhancement aims to mitigate these issues by generating clean high-fidelity signals. While recent generative approaches for speech enhancement have shown promising results, they still face two major challenges: (1) content hallucination, where plausible phonemes generated differ from the original utterance; and (2) inconsistency, failing to preserve speaker's identity and paralinguistic features from the input speech. In this work, we introduce DiTSE (Diffusion Transformer for Speech Enhancement), which addresses quality issues of degraded speech in full bandwidth. Our approach employs a latent diffusion transformer model together with robust conditioning features, effectively addressing these challenges while remaining computationally efficient. Experimental results from both subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that DiTSE achieves state-of-the-art audio quality that, for the first time, matches real studio-quality audio from the DAPS dataset. Furthermore, DiTSE significantly improves the preservation of speaker identity and content fidelity, reducing hallucinations across datasets compared to state-of-the-art enhancers.

Medical images are often large and heterogeneous, where fine details are of vital clinical importance. Image properties change drastically when considering acquisition equipment, patient demographics, and pathology, making realistic medical image generation challenging. Recent work in latent diffusion models (LDMs) has shown success in generating images resampled to a fixed-size. However, this is a narrow subset of the resolutions native to image acquisition, and resampling discards fine anatomical details. MedIL utilizes implicit neural representations to treat images as continuous signals, where encoding and decoding can be performed at arbitrary resolutions without prior resampling. We quantitatively and qualitatively show how MedIL compresses and preserves clinically-relevant features over large multi-site, multi-resolution datasets of both T1w brain MRIs and lung CTs. We further demonstrate how MedIL can influence the quality of images generated with a diffusion model, and discuss how MedIL can enhance generative models to resemble raw clinical acquisitions.</p></details> |  |

While initial research in the area focused on deterministic forecasting, recent works have used diffusion models to produce skillful ensemble forecasts. These models are trained on a single forecasting step and rolled out autoregressively. However, they are computationally expensive and accumulate errors for high temporal resolution due to the many rollout steps. We address these limitations with Continuous Ensemble Forecasting, a novel and flexible method for sampling ensemble forecasts in diffusion models. The method can generate temporally consistent ensemble trajectories completely in parallel, with no autoregressive steps. Continuous Ensemble Forecasting can also be combined with autoregressive rollouts to yield forecasts at an arbitrary fine temporal resolution without sacrificing accuracy.

| **[No-Regret Generative Modeling via Parabolic Monge-Ampère PDE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09279v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel generative modeling framework based on a discretized parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere PDE, which emerges as a continuous limit of the Sinkhorn algorithm commonly used in optimal transport. Our method performs iterative refinement in the space of Brenier maps using a mirror gradient descent step. We establish theoretical guarantees for generative modeling through the lens of no-regret analysis, demonstrating that the iterates converge to the optimal Brenier map under a variety of step-size schedules. As a technical contribution, we derive a new Evolution Variational Inequality tailored to the parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere PDE, connecting geometry, transportation cost, and regret. Our framework accommodates non-log-concave target distributions, constructs an optimal sampling process via the Brenier map, and integrates favorable learning techniques from generative adversarial networks and score-based diffusion models. As direct applications, we illustrate how our theory paves new pathways for generative modeling and variational inference.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |
| **[WikiStyle+: A Multimodal Approach to Content-Style Representation Disentanglement for Artistic Image Stylization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14496v2)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artistic image stylization aims to render the content provided by text or image with the target style, where content and style decoupling is the key to achieve satisfactory results. However, current methods for content and style disentanglement primarily rely on image supervision, which leads to two problems: 1) models can only support one modality for style or content input;2) incomplete disentanglement resulting in content leakage from the reference image. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multimodal approach to content-style disentanglement for artistic image stylization. We construct a \textit{WikiStyle+} dataset consists of artworks with corresponding textual descriptions for style and content. Based on the multimodal dataset, we propose a disentangled representations-guided diffusion model. The disentangled representations are first learned by Q-Formers and then injected into a pre-trained diffusion model using learnable multi-step cross-attention layers. Experimental results show that our method achieves a thorough disentanglement of content and style in reference images under multimodal supervision, thereby enabling more refined stylization that aligns with the artistic characteristics of the reference style. The code of our method will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensemble Score Filter for Data Assimilation of Two-Phase Flow Models in Porous Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09245v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical modeling and simulation of two-phase flow in porous media is challenging due to the uncertainties in key parameters, such as permeability. To address these challenges, we propose a computational framework by utilizing the novel Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF) to enhance the accuracy of state estimation for two-phase flow systems in porous media. The forward simulation of the two-phase flow model is implemented using a mixed finite element method, which ensures accurate approximation of the pressure, the velocity, and the saturation. The EnSF leverages score-based diffusion models to approximate filtering distributions efficiently, avoiding the computational expense of neural network-based methods. By incorporating a closed-form score approximation and an analytical update mechanism, the EnSF overcomes degeneracy issues and handles high-dimensional nonlinear filtering with minimal computational overhead. Numerical experiments demonstrate the capabilities of EnSF in scenarios with uncertain permeability and incomplete observational data.</p></details> |  |
| **[REALM: Real-Time Estimates of Assistance for Learned Models in Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09243v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are a variety of mechanisms (i.e., input types) for real-time human interaction that can facilitate effective human-robot teaming. For example, previous works have shown how teleoperation, corrective, and discrete (i.e., preference over a small number of choices) input can enable robots to complete complex tasks. However, few previous works have looked at combining different methods, and in particular, opportunities for a robot to estimate and elicit the most effective form of assistance given its understanding of a task. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the value of different human assistance mechanisms based on the action uncertainty of a robot policy. Our key idea is to construct mathematical expressions for the expected post-interaction differential entropy (i.e., uncertainty) of a stochastic robot policy to compare the expected value of different interactions. As each type of human input imposes a different requirement for human involvement, we demonstrate how differential entropy estimates can be combined with a likelihood penalization approach to effectively balance feedback informational needs with the level of required input. We demonstrate evidence of how our approach interfaces with emergent learning models (e.g., a diffusion model) to produce accurate assistance value estimates through both simulation and a robot user study. Our user study results indicate that the proposed approach can enable task completion with minimal human feedback for uncertain robot behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

While these systems also facilitate music creation, the element of human creativity and deliberate expression is often limited. In contrast, the present work allows composers, arrangers, and performers to create the basic building blocks for music creation: audio of individual musical notes for use in electronic instruments and DAWs. Through text prompts, the user can specify the timbre characteristics of the audio. We introduce a system that combines a latent diffusion model and multi-modal contrastive learning to generate musical timbres conditioned on text descriptions. By jointly generating the magnitude and phase of the spectrogram, our method eliminates the need for subsequently running a phase retrieval algorithm, as related methods do.

| **[Conceptwm: A Diffusion Model Watermark for Concept Protection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11688v2)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The personalization techniques of diffusion models succeed in generating specific concepts but also pose threats to copyright protection and illegal use. Model Watermarking is an effective method to prevent the unauthorized use of subject-driven or style-driven image generation, safeguarding concept copyrights. However, under the goal of concept-oriented protection, current watermarking schemes typically add watermarks to all images rather than applying them in a refined manner targeted at specific concepts. Additionally, the personalization techniques of diffusion models can easily remove watermarks. Existing watermarking methods struggle to achieve fine-grained watermark embedding with a few images of specific concept and prevent removal of watermarks through personalized fine-tuning. Therefore, we introduce a novel concept-oriented watermarking framework that seamlessly embeds imperceptible watermarks into the concept of diffusion models. We introduce Fidelity-preserving Latent Watermarking (FLW) to generate latent watermarks based on image characteristics and the Adversarial Watermarking Modulation module to prevent "jailbreaking" via personalized finetuning. To enhance U-Net's efficiency in learning watermark patterns with limited samples, we propose Efficient Concept Watermark Finetuning, which alternates optimization of model parameters for both watermark embedding and concept learning. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify our framework. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Conceptwm-4EB3/.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Visual Explanations to Counterfactual Explanations with Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09202v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual counterfactual explanations are ideal hypothetical images that change the decision-making of the classifier with high confidence toward the desired class while remaining visually plausible and close to the initial image. In this paper, we propose a new approach to tackle two key challenges in recent prominent works: i) determining which specific counterfactual features are crucial for distinguishing the "concept" of the target class from the original class, and ii) supplying valuable explanations for the non-robust classifier without relying on the support of an adversarially robust model. Our method identifies the essential region for modification through algorithms that provide visual explanations, and then our framework generates realistic counterfactual explanations by combining adversarial attacks based on pruning the adversarial gradient of the target classifier and the latent diffusion model. The proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art results on various evaluation criteria on ImageNet and CelebA-HQ datasets. In general, our method can be applied to arbitrary classifiers, highlight the strong association between visual and counterfactual explanations, make semantically meaningful changes from the target classifier, and provide observers with subtle counterfactual images.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> |

This paper introduces a new paradigm for robot imitation learning that generates action sequences by reasoning about object motion from visual observations. We propose MBA (Motion Before Action), a novel module that employs two cascaded diffusion processes for object motion generation and robot action generation under object motion guidance. MBA first predicts the future pose sequence of the object based on observations, then uses this sequence as a condition to guide robot action generation. Designed as a plug-and-play component, MBA can be flexibly integrated into existing robotic manipulation policies with diffusion action heads. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the performance of existing policies across a wide range of manipulation tasks.

The framework synthesizes CT and MR images from segmentation masks derived from real patient data and XCAT digital phantoms, achieving a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.94 +/- 0.02 for CT and 0.89 +/- 0.04 for MR images compared to ground-truth images of real patients. It also achieves a Feature Similarity Index Measure (FSIM) of 0.78 +/- 0.04 for CT images from XCAT. The generative quality is further supported by a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 3.62 for CT image generation. Additionally, seg2med can generate paired CT and MR images with consistent anatomical structures and convert images between CT and MR modalities, achieving SSIM values of 0.91 +/- 0.03 for MR-to-CT and 0.77 +/- 0.04 for CT-to-MR conversion. Despite the limitations of incomplete anatomical details in segmentation masks, the framework shows strong performance in cross-modality synthesis and multimodal imaging. seg2med also demonstrates high anatomical fidelity in CT synthesis, achieving a mean Dice coefficient greater than 0.90 for 11 abdominal organs and greater than 0.80 for 34 organs out of 59 in 58 test cases. The highest Dice of 0.96 +/- 0.01 was recorded for the right scapula. Leveraging the TotalSegmentator toolkit, seg2med enables segmentation mask generation across diverse datasets, supporting applications in clinical imaging, data augmentation, multimodal synthesis, and diagnostic algorithm development.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Curriculum Direct Preference Optimization for Diffusion and Consistency Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13637v5)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

Unlike existing methods that synthesize texture maps, we propose to generate segment-wise procedural material graphs as the appearance representation, which supports high-quality rendering and provides substantial flexibility in editing. Instead of relying on extensive paired data, i.e., 3D meshes with material graphs and corresponding text descriptions, to train a material graph generative model, we propose to leverage the pre-trained 2D diffusion model as a bridge to connect the text and material graphs. Specifically, our approach decomposes a shape into a set of segments and designs a segment-controlled diffusion model to synthesize 2D images that are aligned with mesh parts. Based on generated images, we initialize parameters of material graphs and fine-tune them through the differentiable rendering module to produce materials in accordance with the textual description. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in photorealism, resolution, and editability over existing methods.

Two boundary-type cost functionals are considered, and their corresponding variations with respect to shapes are derived using the adjoint method, employing the chain rule approach. This involves firstly utilizing the material derivative of the state system and secondly using its shape derivative. Subsequently, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) combined with the Sobolev-gradient-descent algorithm is applied to stably solve the shape reconstruction problem.

| **[Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampling for multi-modal distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19449v3)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past few years, several approaches utilizing score-based diffusion have been proposed to sample from probability distributions, that is without having access to exact samples and relying solely on evaluations of unnormalized densities. The resulting samplers approximate the time-reversal of a noising diffusion process, bridging the target distribution to an easy-to-sample base distribution. In practice, the performance of these methods heavily depends on key hyperparameters that require ground truth samples to be accurately tuned. Our work aims to highlight and address this fundamental issue, focusing in particular on multi-modal distributions, which pose significant challenges for existing sampling methods. Building on existing approaches, we introduce Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampler (LRDS), a methodology specifically designed to leverage prior knowledge on the location of the target modes in order to bypass the obstacle of hyperparameter tuning. LRDS proceeds in two steps by (i) learning a reference diffusion model on samples located in high-density space regions and tailored for multimodality, and (ii) using this reference model to foster the training of a diffusion-based sampler. We experimentally demonstrate that LRDS best exploits prior knowledge on the target distribution compared to competing algorithms on a variety of challenging distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Convergence of Score-Based Discrete Diffusion Models: A Discrete-Time Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02321v2)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved great success in generating high-dimensional samples across various applications. While the theoretical guarantees for continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied, the convergence analysis of the discrete-state counterparts remains under-explored. In this paper, we study the theoretical aspects of score-based discrete diffusion models under the Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) framework. We introduce a discrete-time sampling algorithm in the general state space $[S]^d$ that utilizes score estimators at predefined time points. We derive convergence bounds for the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and total variation (TV) distance between the generated sample distribution and the data distribution, considering both scenarios with and without early stopping under reasonable assumptions. Notably, our KL divergence bounds are nearly linear in the dimension $d$, aligning with state-of-the-art results for diffusion models. Our convergence analysis employs a Girsanov-based method and establishes key properties of the discrete score function, which are essential for characterizing the discrete-time sampling process.</p></details> | 26 pages, 1 figure |

Despite recent advances, there is no comprehensive pipeline yet for bimanual class-agnostic interaction reconstruction from a monocular RGB video, where two hands and an unknown object are interacting with each other. Previous works tackled the limited hand-object interaction case, where object templates are pre-known or only one hand is involved in the interaction. The bimanual interaction reconstruction exhibits severe occlusions introduced by complex interactions between two hands and an object. To solve this, we first introduce BIGS (Bimanual Interaction 3D Gaussian Splatting), a method that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of hands and an unknown object from a monocular video. To robustly obtain object Gaussians avoiding severe occlusions, we leverage prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model with score distillation sampling (SDS) loss, to reconstruct unseen object parts. For hand Gaussians, we exploit the 3D priors of hand model (i.e., MANO) and share a single Gaussian for two hands to effectively accumulate hand 3D information, given limited views. To further consider the 3D alignment between hands and objects, we include the interacting-subjects optimization step during Gaussian optimization. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on two challenging datasets, in terms of 3D hand pose estimation (MPJPE), 3D object reconstruction (CDh, CDo, F10), and rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[LD4MRec: Simplifying and Powering Diffusion Model for Multimedia Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15363v2)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimedia recommendation aims to predict users' future behaviors based on observed behaviors and item content information. However, the inherent noise contained in observed behaviors easily leads to suboptimal recommendation performance. Recently, the diffusion model's ability to generate information from noise presents a promising solution to this issue, prompting us to explore its application in multimedia recommendation. Nonetheless, several challenges must be addressed: 1) The diffusion model requires simplification to meet the efficiency requirements of real-time recommender systems, 2) The generated behaviors must align with user preference. To address these challenges, we propose a Light Diffusion model for Multimedia Recommendation (LD4MRec). LD4MRec largely reduces computational complexity by employing a forward-free inference strategy, which directly predicts future behaviors from observed noisy behaviors. Meanwhile, to ensure the alignment between generated behaviors and user preference, we propose a novel Conditional neural Network (C-Net). C-Net achieves guided generation by leveraging two key signals, collaborative signals and personalized modality preference signals, thereby improving the semantic consistency between generated behaviors and user preference. Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LD4MRec.</p></details> |  |

Existing thermal-visible image fusion mainly focuses on detection tasks, ignoring other critical information such as depth. By addressing the limitations of single modalities in low-light and complex environments, the depth information from fused images not only generates more accurate point cloud data, improving the completeness and precision of 3D reconstruction, but also provides comprehensive scene understanding for robot navigation, localization, and environmental perception. This supports precise recognition and efficient operations in applications such as autonomous driving and rescue missions. We introduce a text-guided and depth-driven infrared and visible image fusion network. The model consists of an image fusion branch for extracting multi-channel complementary information through a diffusion model, equipped with a text-guided module, and two auxiliary depth estimation branches. The fusion branch uses CLIP to extract semantic information and parameters from depth-enriched image descriptions to guide the diffusion model in extracting multi-channel features and generating fused images. These fused images are then input into the depth estimation branches to calculate depth-driven loss, optimizing the image fusion network. This framework aims to integrate vision-language and depth to directly generate color-fused images from multimodal inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sculpting Memory: Multi-Concept Forgetting in Diffusion Models via Dynamic Mask and Concept-Aware Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09039v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts. However, their ability to store vast amounts of knowledge raises concerns in scenarios where selective forgetting is necessary, such as removing copyrighted content, reducing biases, or eliminating harmful concepts. While existing unlearning methods can remove certain concepts, they struggle with multi-concept forgetting due to instability, residual knowledge persistence, and generation quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Dynamic Mask coupled with Concept-Aware Loss}, a novel unlearning framework designed for multi-concept forgetting in diffusion models. Our \textbf{Dynamic Mask} mechanism adaptively updates gradient masks based on current optimization states, allowing selective weight modifications that prevent interference with unrelated knowledge. Additionally, our \textbf{Concept-Aware Loss} explicitly guides the unlearning process by enforcing semantic consistency through superclass alignment, while a regularization loss based on knowledge distillation ensures that previously unlearned concepts remain forgotten during sequential unlearning. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approach. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unlearning techniques in forgetting effectiveness, output fidelity, and semantic coherence, particularly in multi-concept scenarios. Our work provides a principled and flexible framework for stable and high-fidelity unlearning in generative models. The code will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |
