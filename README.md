| **[Tradeoff Between the Number of Transmitted Molecules and the BER Performance in Molecular Communication between Bionanosensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04466v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of molecular communication (MC), information is conveyed through the characteristics of molecules transmitted between the transmitter and the receiver bionanosensors via propagation. The constrained size of the transmitter imposes limitations on its storage capacity, constraining the number of available molecules for transmission, with a resulting effect on communication reliability. This paper primarily focuses on achieving an equilibrium between the number of transmitted molecules and the bit error rate (BER) performance. To this end, we first analyze the relationship between the number of transmitted molecules and the BER performance. Subsequently, a balancing function that considers both the number of transmitted molecules and the BER performance is introduced, taking into account the molecules' respective weights. Given the difference in magnitude between the number of transmitted molecules and the BER, these parameters are normalized to facilitate analysis. Subsequently, a Gradient Descent Algorithm is employed to determine the optimal number of transmitted molecules, aiming to achieve the optimal equilibrium in the analyzed MC system. Theoretical and simulation results are provided, substantiating that the optimal outcome indeed establishes an ideal balance between the number of transmitted molecules and the BER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Sensors Journal</p></details> |

This paper explores the potential of using molecular communication (MC) to address the challenges in constructing IoBNT for epidemic prevention, specifically focusing on modeling viral transmission, detecting the virus/infected individuals, and identifying virus mutations. First, the MC channels in macroscale and microscale scenarios are discussed to match viral transmission in both scales separately. Besides, the detection methods for these two scales are also studied, along with the localization mechanism designed for the virus/infected individuals. Moreover, an identification strategy is proposed to determine potential virus mutations, which is validated through simulation using the ORF3a protein as a benchmark. Finally, open research issues are discussed. In summary, this paper aims to analyze viral transmission through MC and combat viral spread using signal processing techniques within MC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |
| **[One Small Step with Fingerprints, One Giant Leap for emph{De Novo} Molecule Generation from Mass Spectra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04180v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common approach to the \emph{de novo} molecular generation problem from mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into molecular structures. In our work, we adopt \textsc{MIST}~\citep{MISTgoldmanAnnotatingMetaboliteMass2023} as the encoder and \textsc{MolForge}~\citep{ucakReconstructionLosslessMolecular2023} as the decoder, leveraging pretraining to enhance performance. Notably, pretraining \textsc{MolForge} proves especially effective, enabling it to serve as a robust fingerprint-to-structure decoder. Additionally, instead of passing the probability of each bit in the fingerprint, thresholding the probabilities as a step function helps focus the decoder on the presence of substructures, improving recovery of accurate molecular structures even when the fingerprints predicted by \textsc{MIST} only moderately resembles the ground truth in terms of Tanimoto similarity. This combination of encoder and decoder results in a tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1 28\% / top-10 36\% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra. We position this pipeline as a strong baseline for future research in \emph{de novo} molecule elucidation from mass spectra.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Quantum--Classical Machine Learning Potential with Variational Quantum Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04098v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum algorithms for simulating large and complex molecular systems are still in their infancy, and surpassing state-of-the-art classical techniques remains an ever-receding goal post. A promising avenue of inquiry in the meanwhile is to seek practical advantages through hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, which combine conventional neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) running on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Such hybrids are well suited to NISQ hardware. The classical processor performs the bulk of the computation, while the quantum processor executes targeted sub-tasks that supply additional non-linearity and expressivity. Here, we benchmark a purely classical E(3)-equivariant message-passing machine learning potential (MLP) against a hybrid quantum-classical MLP for predicting density functional theory (DFT) properties of liquid silicon. In our hybrid architecture, every readout in the message-passing layers is replaced by a VQC. Molecular dynamics simulations driven by the HQC-MLP reveal that an accurate reproduction of high-temperature structural and thermodynamic properties is achieved with VQCs. These findings demonstrate a concrete scenario in which NISQ-compatible HQC algorithm could deliver a measurable benefit over the best available classical alternative, suggesting a viable pathway toward near-term quantum advantage in materials modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>26+6 ...</summary><p>26+6 pages, 6+4 figures</p></details> |
| **[PET2Rep: Towards Vision-Language Model-Drived Automated Radiology Report Generation for Positron Emission Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04062v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positron emission tomography (PET) is a cornerstone of modern oncologic and neurologic imaging, distinguished by its unique ability to illuminate dynamic metabolic processes that transcend the anatomical focus of traditional imaging technologies. Radiology reports are essential for clinical decision making, yet their manual creation is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent advancements of vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential in medical applications, presenting a promising avenue for automating report generation. However, existing applications of VLMs in the medical domain have predominantly focused on structural imaging modalities, while the unique characteristics of molecular PET imaging have largely been overlooked. To bridge the gap, we introduce PET2Rep, a large-scale comprehensive benchmark for evaluation of general and medical VLMs for radiology report generation for PET images. PET2Rep stands out as the first dedicated dataset for PET report generation with metabolic information, uniquely capturing whole-body image-report pairs that cover dozens of organs to fill the critical gap in existing benchmarks and mirror real-world clinical comprehensiveness. In addition to widely recognized natural language generation metrics, we introduce a series of clinical efficiency metrics to evaluate the quality of radiotracer uptake pattern description in key organs in generated reports. We conduct a head-to-head comparison of 30 cutting-edge general-purpose and medical-specialized VLMs. The results show that the current state-of-the-art VLMs perform poorly on PET report generation task, falling considerably short of fulfilling practical needs. Moreover, we identify several key insufficiency that need to be addressed to advance the development in medical applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[Potential Score Matching: Debiasing Molecular Structure Sampling with Potential Energy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14569v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolReasoner: Toward Effective and Interpretable Reasoning for Molecular LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02066v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics, while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT) samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently, Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions, thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[BSL: A Unified and Generalizable Multitask Learning Platform for Virtual Drug Discovery from Design to Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01195v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health, prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced, open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery, offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor, successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery. The platform is accessible at https://www.baishenglai.net.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolPIF: A Parameter Interpolation Flow Model for Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13762v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space. However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore, the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design, demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for model design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Super-resolution Inspired Electron Density Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12335v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drawing inspiration from the domain of image super-resolution, we view the electron density as a 3D grayscale image and use a convolutional residual network to transform a crude and trivially generated guess of the molecular density into an accurate ground-state quantum mechanical density. We find that this model outperforms all prior density prediction approaches. Because the input is itself a real-space density, the predictions are equivariant to molecular symmetry transformations even though the model is not constructed to be. Due to its simplicity, the model is directly applicable to unseen molecular conformations and chemical elements. We show that fine-tuning on limited new data provides high accuracy even in challenging cases of exotic elements and charge states. Our work suggests new routes to learning real-space physical quantities drawing from the established ideas of image processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Representation Condition Improves Equivariant Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03655v4)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in molecular generative models have demonstrated great promise for accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often struggle to generate high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to improve molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared with single-stage generation, the easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second stage generation toward a high-quality molecule in a goal-oriented way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 50\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations. Furthermore, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly reducing the generation iterations needed.

| **[Look the Other Way: Designing 'Positive' Molecules with Negative Data via Task Arithmetic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17876v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive' molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions' $--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules. Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning strategy for de novo molecule design.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenMol: A Drug Discovery Generalist with Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06158v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is a complex process that involves multiple stages and tasks. However, existing molecular generative models can only tackle some of these tasks. We present Generalist Molecular generative model (GenMol), a versatile framework that uses only a single discrete diffusion model to handle diverse drug discovery scenarios. GenMol generates Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing the utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering while having better sampling efficiency. GenMol uses fragments as basic building blocks for molecules and introduces fragment remasking, a strategy that optimizes molecules by regenerating masked fragments, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. We further propose molecular context guidance (MCG), a guidance method tailored for masked discrete diffusion of GenMol. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model in de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization. These results demonstrate that GenMol can tackle a wide range of drug discovery tasks, providing a unified and versatile approach for molecular design. Our code is available at https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/genmol.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Aligned Manifold Property and Topology Point Clouds for Learning Molecular Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16223v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models for molecular property prediction generally rely on representations -- such as SMILES strings and molecular graphs -- that overlook the surface-local phenomena driving intermolecular behavior. 3D-based approaches often reduce surface detail or require computationally expensive SE(3)-equivariant architectures to manage spatial variance. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces AMPTCR (Aligned Manifold Property and Topology Cloud Representation), a molecular surface representation that combines local quantum-derived scalar fields and custom topological descriptors within an aligned point cloud format. Each surface point includes a chemically meaningful scalar, geodesically derived topology vectors, and coordinates transformed into a canonical reference frame, enabling efficient learning with conventional SE(3)-sensitive architectures. AMPTCR is evaluated using a DGCNN framework on two tasks: molecular weight and bacterial growth inhibition. For molecular weight, results confirm that AMPTCR encodes physically meaningful data, with a validation R^2 of 0.87. In the bacterial inhibition task, AMPTCR enables both classification and direct regression of E. coli inhibition values using Dual Fukui functions as the electronic descriptor and Morgan Fingerprints as auxiliary data, achieving an ROC AUC of 0.912 on the classification task, and an R^2 of 0.54 on the regression task. These results help demonstrate that AMPTCR offers a compact, expressive, and architecture-agnostic representation for modeling surface-mediated molecular properties.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[BARNN: A Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18665v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive and recurrent networks have achieved remarkable progress across various fields, from weather forecasting to molecular generation and Large Language Models. Despite their strong predictive capabilities, these models lack a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty, which is key in scientific applications such as PDE solving, molecular generation and Machine Learning Force Fields. To address this shortcoming we present BARNN: a variational Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network. BARNNs aim to provide a principled way to turn any autoregressive or recurrent model into its Bayesian version. BARNN is based on the variational dropout method, allowing to apply it to large recurrent neural networks as well. We also introduce a temporal version of the "Variational Mixtures of Posteriors" prior (tVAMP-prior) to make Bayesian inference efficient and well-calibrated. Extensive experiments on PDE modelling and molecular generation demonstrate that BARNN not only achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, but also excels in uncertainty quantification and modelling long-range dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoDyGAN: Combining Molecular Dynamics With GANs to Investigate Protein Conformational Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13950v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensively exploring protein conformational landscapes remains a major challenge in computational biology due to the high computational cost involved in dynamic physics-based simulations. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational spaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into MD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble learning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of generated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative representation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into 2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use three rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new conformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that interpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that representing proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying advanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an efficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed framework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computing and Bounding Equilibrium Concentrations in Athermic Chemical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12699v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing equilibrium concentrations of molecular complexes is generally analytically intractable and requires numerical approaches. In this work we focus on the polymer-monomer level, where indivisible molecules (monomers) combine to form complexes (polymers). Rather than employing free-energy parameters for each polymer, we focus on the athermic setting where all interactions preserve enthalpy. This setting aligns with the strongly bonded (domain-based) regime in DNA nanotechnology when strands can bind in different ways, but always with maximum overall bonding -- and is consistent with the saturated configurations in the Thermodynamic Binding Networks (TBNs) model. Within this context, we develop an iterative algorithm for assigning polymer concentrations to satisfy detailed-balance, where on-target (desired) polymers are in high concentrations and off-target (undesired) polymers are in low. Even if not directly executed, our algorithm provides effective insights into upper bounds on concentration of off-target polymers, connecting combinatorial arguments about discrete configurations such as those in the TBN model to real-valued concentrations. We conclude with an application of our method to decreasing leak in DNA logic and signal propagation. Our results offer a new framework for design and verification of equilibrium concentrations when configurations are distinguished by entropic forces.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in DNA31 (31st International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming)</p></details> |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced LP performance recently, existing methods face key challenges including limited supervision from sparse connectivity, sensitivity to initialization, and poor generalization under distribution shifts. We explore pretraining as a solution to address these challenges. Unlike node classification, LP is inherently a pairwise task, which requires the integration of both node- and edge-level information. In this work, we present the first systematic study on the transferability of these distinct modules and propose a late fusion strategy to effectively combine their outputs for improved performance. To handle the diversity of pretraining data and avoid negative transfer, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that captures distinct patterns in separate experts, facilitating seamless application of the pretrained model on diverse downstream datasets. For fast adaptation, we develop a parameter-efficient tuning strategy that allows the pretrained model to adapt to unseen datasets with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on 16 datasets across two domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on low-resource link prediction while obtaining competitive results compared to end-to-end trained methods, with over 10,000x lower computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 Research Track</p></details> |
| **[Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04336v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors. Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 14 pages |

By analyzing over 5,000 empirical identity theft and fraud cases, this research identifies which types of personal data are exposed, how frequently exposures occur, and what the consequences of those exposures are. We construct an Identity Ecosystem graph--a foundational, graph-based model in which nodes represent personally identifiable information (PII) attributes and edges represent empirical disclosure relationships between them (e.g., the probability that one PII attribute is exposed due to the exposure of another). Leveraging this graph structure, we develop a privacy risk prediction framework that uses graph theory and graph neural networks to estimate the likelihood of further disclosures when certain PII attributes are compromised. The results show that our approach effectively answers the core question: Can the disclosure of a given identity attribute possibly lead to the disclosure of another attribute?</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory planning framework that integrates the adaptability of learning-based methods with the formal safety guarantees of optimization-based approaches. The framework features a two-layer architecture: an upper layer employing a graph neural network (GNN) trained on real-world highway data to predict human-like longitudinal velocity profiles, and a lower layer utilizing path optimization formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The primary contribution is the lower-layer path optimization model, which introduces a linear approximation of discretized vehicle geometry to substantially reduce computational complexity, while enforcing strict spatiotemporal non-overlapping constraints to formally guarantee collision avoidance throughout the planning horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that the planner generates highly smooth, collision-free trajectories in complex real-world emergency scenarios, achieving success rates exceeding 97% with average planning times of 54 ms, thereby confirming real-time capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Regression for Spatial-Temporal Sensor Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06917v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing deployment of low-cost, distributed sensor networks in environmental and biomedical domains has enabled continuous, large-scale health monitoring. However, these systems often face challenges related to degraded data quality caused by sensor drift, noise, and insufficient calibration -- factors that limit their reliability in real-world applications. Traditional machine learning methods for sensor fusion and calibration rely on extensive feature engineering and struggle to capture spatial-temporal dependencies or adapt to distribution shifts across varying deployment conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method tailored for regression tasks. Our proposed method integrates effectively with Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks and leverages the alignment of perturbed inverse Gram matrices between source and target domains, drawing inspiration from Tikhonov regularization. This approach enables scalable and efficient domain adaptation without requiring labeled data in the target domain. We validate our novel method on real-world datasets from two distinct applications: air quality monitoring and EEG signal reconstruction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance which paves the way for more robust and transferable sensor fusion models in both environmental and physiological contexts.

| **[ProtoN: Prototype Node Graph Neural Network for Unconstrained Multi-Impression Ear Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04381v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation, restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework, ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction. Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1 identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as 0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited data conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Circuit-Aware SAT Solving: Guiding CDCL via Conditional Probabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04235v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) plays a pivotal role in Electronic Design Automation. The standard workflow for solving CSAT problems converts circuits into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and employs generic SAT solvers powered by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL). However, this process inherently discards rich structural and functional information, leading to suboptimal solver performance. To address this limitation, we introduce CASCAD, a novel circuit-aware SAT solving framework that directly leverages circuit-level conditional probabilities computed via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By explicitly modeling gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD dynamically guides two critical CDCL heuristics -- variable phase selection and clause managementto significantly enhance solver efficiency. Extensive evaluations on challenging real-world Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC) benchmarks demonstrate that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to state-of-the-art CNF-based approaches, achieving an additional 23.5% runtime reduction via our probability-guided clause filtering strategy. Our results underscore the importance of preserving circuit-level structural insights within SAT solvers, providing a robust foundation for future improvements in SAT-solving efficiency and EDA tool design.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Efficient Data Selection for Training Genomic Perturbation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14571v5)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based Perturb-seq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene perturbation models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Due to the cost of genomic experiments, active learning is often employed to train these models, alternating between wet-lab experiments and model updates. However, the operational constraints of the wet-lab and the iterative nature of active learning significantly increase the total training time. Furthermore, the inherent sensitivity to model initialization can lead to markedly different sets of gene perturbations across runs, which undermines the reproducibility, interpretability, and reusability of the method. To this end, we propose a graph-based data filtering method that, unlike active learning, selects the gene perturbations in one shot and in a model-free manner. The method optimizes a criterion that maximizes the supervision signal from the graph neural network to enhance generalization. The criterion is defined over the input graph and is optimized with submodular maximization. We compare it empirically to active learning, and the results demonstrate that despite yielding months of acceleration, it also improves the stability of the selected perturbation experiments while achieving comparable test error.</p></details> | 19 pages |

In many application scenarios, the matrix multiplication takes places on an arbitrary algebraic semiring where the scalar operations are overloaded with user-defined functions with certain properties or a more general heterogenous algebra where even the domains of the input matrices can be different. Here, we provide a unifying treatment of the sparse matrix-matrix operation and its rich application space including machine learning, computational biology and chemistry, graph algorithms, and scientific computing.</p></details> |  |

In addition to users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged by other large-scale industrial models.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Model, Any Conjunctive Query: Graph Neural Networks for Answering Queries over Incomplete Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13959v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the incompleteness of modern knowledge graphs, a new setup for query answering has emerged, where the goal is to predict answers that do not necessarily appear in the knowledge graph, but are present in its completion. In this paper, we formally introduce and study two query answering problems, namely, query answer classification and query answer retrieval. To solve these problems, we propose AnyCQ, a model that can classify answers to any conjunctive query on any knowledge graph. At the core of our framework lies a graph neural network trained using a reinforcement learning objective to answer Boolean queries. Trained only on simple, small instances, AnyCQ generalizes to large queries of arbitrary structure, reliably classifying and retrieving answers to queries that existing approaches fail to handle. This is empirically validated through our newly proposed, challenging benchmarks. Finally, we empirically show that AnyCQ can effectively transfer to completely novel knowledge graphs when equipped with an appropriate link prediction model, highlighting its potential for querying incomplete data.</p></details> |  |
| **[S2FGL: Spatial Spectral Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02409v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the semantic knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drift occurs, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate the challenge of poor semantic knowledge caused by label signal disruption. Furthermore, we design a frequency alignment to address spectral client drift. The combination of Spatial and Spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing and Enhancing the Robustness of GNN-based QEC Decoders with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03783v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful, data-driven approach for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding, capable of learning complex noise characteristics directly from syndrome data. However, the robustness of these decoders against subtle, adversarial perturbations remains a critical open question. This work introduces a novel framework to systematically probe the vulnerabilities of a GNN decoder using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The RL agent is trained as an adversary with the goal of finding minimal syndrome modifications that cause the decoder to misclassify. We apply this framework to a Graph Attention Network (GAT) decoder trained on experimental surface code data from Google Quantum AI. Our results show that the RL agent can successfully identify specific, critical vulnerabilities, achieving a high attack success rate with a minimal number of bit flips. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the decoder's robustness can be significantly enhanced through adversarial training, where the model is retrained on the adversarial examples generated by the RL agent. This iterative process of automated vulnerability discovery and targeted retraining presents a promising methodology for developing more reliable and robust neural network decoders for fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, Affiliation updated to match user registration</p></details> |

Evaluating the Efficacy of Knowledge Distillation from MWPM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03782v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of decoders in Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is key to realizing practical quantum computers. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, but their training methodologies are not yet well-established. It is generally expected that transferring theoretical knowledge from classical algorithms like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) to GNNs, a technique known as knowledge distillation, can effectively improve performance. In this work, we test this hypothesis by rigorously comparing two models based on a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture that incorporates temporal information as node features. The first is a purely data-driven model (baseline) trained only on ground-truth labels, while the second incorporates a knowledge distillation loss based on the theoretical error probabilities from MWPM. Using public experimental data from Google, our evaluation reveals that while the final test accuracy of the knowledge distillation model was nearly identical to the baseline, its training loss converged more slowly, and the training time increased by a factor of approximately five. This result suggests that modern GNN architectures possess a high capacity to efficiently learn complex error correlations directly from real hardware data, without guidance from approximate theoretical models.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table.

| **[GaitAdapt: Continual Learning for Evolving Gait Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03375v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt, which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks, thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[BriLLM: Brain-inspired Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11299v6)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce BriLLM, a brain-inspired large language model that redefines the foundations of generative language modeling. Departing from Transformer architectures, GPT frameworks, and traditional input-output constrained paradigms, BriLLM is built on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) mechanism - a directed graph-based neural network design that enables full interpretability across all nodes, in contrast to conventional models limited to input-output interpretability. In this framework, tokens are represented as graph nodes, with signal flows - either randomly initialized or user-defined - propagating along paths following a "least resistance" principle. The next token to be generated emerges as the target of this signal flow. Theoretically, BriLLM supports infinitely long n-gram modeling, with model size decoupled from input and prediction length. Its signal propagation dynamics mimic human-like cognitive patterns, enabling recall activation and inherent multi-modal compatibility. We release initial Chinese and English BriLLM versions (4000 tokens, 32-dimensional nodes, 32-token sequence prediction capacity) with sizes ~2B and ~1B parameters, respectively, achieving performance comparable to GPT-1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterophily-Aware Fair Recommendation using Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03365v4)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to improve the accuracy and performance of recommender systems. Modern recommender systems are not only designed to serve end users, but also to benefit other participants, such as items and item providers. These participants may have different or conflicting goals and interests, which raises the need for fairness and popularity bias considerations. GNN-based recommendation methods also face the challenges of unfairness and popularity bias, and their normalization and aggregation processes suffer from these challenges. In this paper, we propose a fair GNN-based recommender system, called HetroFair, to improve item-side fairness. HetroFair uses two separate components to generate fairness-aware embeddings: i) Fairness-aware attention, which incorporates the dot product in the normalization process of GNNs to decrease the effect of nodes' degrees. ii) Heterophily feature weighting, to assign distinct weights to different features during the aggregation process. To evaluate the effectiveness of HetroFair, we conduct extensive experiments over six real-world datasets. Our experimental results reveal that HetroFair not only alleviates unfairness and popularity bias on the item side but also achieves superior accuracy on the user side. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/NematGH/HetroFair.</p></details> |  |

Online Continual Learning (OCL) specifically focuses on learning efficiently from a continuous stream of data with shifting distribution. While recent studies explore Continual Learning on graphs exploiting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), only few of them focus on a streaming setting. Yet, many real-world graphs evolve over time, often requiring timely and online predictions. Current approaches, however, are not well aligned with the standard OCL setting, partly due to the lack of a clear definition of online Continual Learning on graphs. In this work, we propose a general formulation for online Continual Learning on graphs, emphasizing the efficiency requirements on batch processing over the graph topology, and providing a well-defined setting for systematic model evaluation. Finally, we introduce a set of benchmarks and report the performance of several methods in the CL literature, adapted to our setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness -- some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second, predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph. ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Information Bottleneck-Guided Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Interpretable Neurodevelopmental Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20769v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing interpretable models for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) diagnosis presents significant challenges in effectively encoding, decoding, and integrating multimodal neuroimaging data. While many existing machine learning approaches have shown promise in brain network analysis, they typically suffer from limited interpretability, particularly in extracting meaningful biomarkers from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and establishing clear relationships between imaging features and demographic characteristics. Besides, current graph neural network methodologies face limitations in capturing both local and global functional connectivity patterns while simultaneously achieving theoretically principled multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a unified framework that applies information bottleneck principles to guide both brain connectivity modeling and cross-modal feature integration. This framework comprises two complementary components. The first is the Information Bottleneck Graph Transformer (IBGraphFormer), which combines transformer-based global attention mechanisms with graph neural networks through information bottleneck-guided pooling to identify sufficient biomarkers. The second is the Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (IB-HGAN), which employs meta-path-based heterogeneous graph learning with structural consistency constraints to achieve interpretable fusion of neuroimaging and demographic data. The experimental results demonstrate that I2B-HGNN achieves superior performance in diagnosing NDDs, exhibiting both high classification accuracy and the ability to provide interpretable biomarker identification while effectively analyzing non-imaging data.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation: DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements. HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction (e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model while significantly outperforming prior works.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Aging Multiverse: Generating Condition-Aware Facial Aging Tree via Training-Free Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21008v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.</p></details> |  |

To enable this, we generalize stochastic interpolants by replacing the scalar time variable with vectors, matrices, or linear operators, allowing us to bridge probability distributions across multiple dimensional spaces. This approach enables the construction of versatile generative models capable of fulfilling multiple tasks without task-specific training. Our operator-based interpolants not only provide a unifying theoretical perspective for existing generative models but also extend their capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the zero-shot efficacy of our method on conditional generation and inpainting, fine-tuning and posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling, suggesting its potential as a generic task-agnostic alternative to specialized models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CreatiLayout: Siamese Multimodal Diffusion Transformer for Creative Layout-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03859v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been recognized for their ability to generate images that are not only visually appealing but also of high artistic quality. As a result, Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation has been proposed to leverage region-specific positions and descriptions to enable more precise and controllable generation. However, previous methods primarily focus on UNet-based models (\eg SD1.5 and SDXL), and limited effort has explored Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs), which have demonstrated powerful image generation capabilities. Enabling MM-DiT for layout-to-image generation seems straightforward but is challenging due to the complexity of how layout is introduced, integrated, and balanced among multiple modalities. To this end, we explore various network variants to efficiently incorporate layout guidance into MM-DiT, and ultimately present SiamLayout. To inherit the advantages of MM-DiT, we use a separate set of network weights to process the layout, treating it as equally important as the image and text modalities. Meanwhile, to alleviate the competition among modalities, we decouple the image-layout interaction into a siamese branch alongside the image-text one and fuse them in the later stage. Moreover, we contribute a large-scale layout dataset, named LayoutSAM, which includes 2.7 million image-text pairs and 10.7 million entities. Each entity is annotated with a bounding box and a detailed description. We further construct the LayoutSAM-Eval benchmark as a comprehensive tool for evaluating the L2I generation quality. Finally, we introduce the Layout Designer, which taps into the potential of large language models in layout planning, transforming them into experts in layout generation and optimization. These components form CreatiLayout -- a systematic solution that integrates the layout model, dataset, and planner for creative layout-to-image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a probabilistic deep learning framework based on Deep Ensembles (DE) of Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), enabling estimation of total predictive uncertainty and decomposition into aleatoric (AU) and epistemic (EU) components. The method was benchmarked against non probabilistic neural networks, a Bayesian fitting approach and a probabilistic network with single Gaussian parametrization. Supervised training was performed on synthetic data, and evaluation was conducted on both simulated and two in vivo datasets. The reliability of the quantified uncertainties was assessed using calibration curves, output distribution sharpness, and the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). MDNs produced more calibrated and sharper predictive distributions for the D and f parameters, although slight overconfidence was observed in D*. The Robust Coefficient of Variation (RCV) indicated smoother in vivo estimates for D* with MDNs compared to Gaussian model. Despite the training data covering the expected physiological range, elevated EU in vivo suggests a mismatch with real acquisition conditions, highlighting the importance of incorporating EU, which was allowed by DE. Overall, we present a comprehensive framework for IVIM fitting with uncertainty quantification, which enables the identification and interpretation of unreliable estimates. The proposed approach can also be adopted for fitting other physical models through appropriate architectural and simulation adjustments.</p></details> |  |

In DDTracking, we introduce a dual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding (capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global temporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire streamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which leverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline propagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI datasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two well-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and TractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current state-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight DDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning varying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types. Collectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography, presenting a scalable, adaptable, and end-to-end learnable solution for broad dMRI applications.

Current deep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation matrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth alignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the anatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular distribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric constraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new automatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by diffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main components: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a diffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD). Geometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level alignment. DTMD, as an auxiliary module, learns the latent distribution of transformation matrices from clinical data. We integrate point cloud-based transformation regression and diffusion-based transformation modeling into a unified framework, allowing bidirectional feedback between geometric constraints and diffusion refinement. Extensive ablation and comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method, highlighting its potential in orthodontic treatment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Drone Detection with Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04564v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diffusion of drones presents significant security and safety challenges. Traditional surveillance systems, particularly conventional frame-based cameras, struggle to reliably detect these targets due to their small size, high agility, and the resulting motion blur and poor performance in challenging lighting conditions. This paper surveys the emerging field of event-based vision as a robust solution to these problems. Event cameras virtually eliminate motion blur and enable consistent detection in extreme lighting. Their sparse, asynchronous output suppresses static backgrounds, enabling low-latency focus on motion cues. We review the state-of-the-art in event-based drone detection, from data representation methods to advanced processing pipelines using spiking neural networks. The discussion extends beyond simple detection to cover more sophisticated tasks such as real-time tracking, trajectory forecasting, and unique identification through propeller signature analysis. By examining current methodologies, available datasets, and the distinct advantages of the technology, this work demonstrates that event-based vision provides a powerful foundation for the next generation of reliable, low-latency, and efficient counter-UAV systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Model For All: Partial Diffusion for Unified Try-On and Try-Off in Any Pose](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04559v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment, the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose try-on from just one image.

| **[Two-Way Garment Transfer: Unified Diffusion Framework for Dressing and Undressing Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04551v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advances in virtual try-on (VTON) have achieved realistic garment transfer to human subjects, its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF), which aims to reconstruct canonical garment templates from dressed humans, remains critically underexplored and lacks systematic investigation. Existing works predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment dressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their complementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified framework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously resolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional feature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned guidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly bridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask dependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a phased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[JointTuner: Appearance-Motion Adaptive Joint Training for Customized Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23951v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in customized video generation have led to significant improvements in the simultaneous adaptation of appearance and motion. While prior methods typically decouple appearance and motion training, the stage-wise strategy often introduces concept interference, resulting in inaccurate rendering of appearance features or motion patterns. Another challenge is appearance contamination, where background and foreground elements from reference videos distort the customized subject. In this work, we propose JointTuner, a novel framework that enables joint optimization of both appearance and motion components by leveraging two key innovations: Synaptic Low-Rank Adaptation (Synaptic LoRA) and Appearance-independent Temporal Loss (AiT Loss). Synaptic LoRA introduces a synaptic regulator, implemented as a context-aware linear activation layer, to dynamically guide LoRA modules to focus on either subject appearance or motion patterns, thereby enabling consistent optimization across spatial and temporal dimensions. AiT Loss disrupts the gradient flow of appearance-related components, guiding the model to focus exclusively on motion learning and minimizing appearance interference. JointTuner is compatible with both UNet-based models (e.g., ZeroScope) and Diffusion Transformer-based models (e.g., CogVideoX), supporting the generation of longer and higher-quality customized videos. Additionally, we present a systematic evaluation framework for appearance-motion combined customization, covering 90 combinations evaluated along four critical dimensions: semantic alignment, motion dynamism, temporal consistency, and perceptual quality.

| **[QuantVSR: Low-Bit Post-Training Quantization for Real-World Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04485v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition, we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods.

Unlike previous multi-view video methods that directly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross view/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse multi-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and effectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this, explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately, enabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D object dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16 videos with 21 frames for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and 4D generation. Our project page is https://4dvd.github.io/</p></details> |  |

| **[Hierarchical Scoring for Machine Learning Classifier Error Impact Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04489v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample. Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors. Python implementations of the scoring metrics will be available in an open-source repository at time of publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closed-Circuit Television Data as an Emergent Data Source for Urban Rail Platform Crowding Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03749v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate, real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus, for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data, independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational responses for platform crowding mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 17 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

A core contribution is the 'cardinality' map, a novel regression target that accounts for variations in object size and spatial distribution. Leveraging representation alignment and a hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object count estimation and fine-grained guidance for generative models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that YOLO-Count achieves state-of-the-art counting accuracy while providing robust and effective quantity control for T2I systems.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations, including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM25 has accepted this paper</p></details> |
| **[Querying Autonomous Vehicle Point Clouds: Enhanced by 3D Object Counting with CounterNet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19209v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data, state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories, resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counting Stacked Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19149v4)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual object counting is a fundamental computer vision task underpinning numerous real-world applications, from cell counting in biomedicine to traffic and wildlife monitoring. However, existing methods struggle to handle the challenge of stacked 3D objects in which most objects are hidden by those above them. To address this important yet underexplored problem, we propose a novel 3D counting approach that decomposes the task into two complementary subproblems - estimating the 3D geometry of the object stack and the occupancy ratio from multi-view images. By combining geometric reconstruction and deep learning-based depth analysis, our method can accurately count identical objects within containers, even when they are irregularly stacked. We validate our 3D Counting pipeline on diverse real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets, which we will release publicly to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV2...</summary><p>ICCV25 Oral.

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |
| **[Which graph motif parameters count?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12244v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a fixed graph H, the function #IndSub(H,*) maps graphs G to the count of induced H-copies in G; this function obviously "counts something" in that it has a combinatorial interpretation. Linear combinations of such functions are called graph motif parameters and have recently received significant attention in counting complexity after a seminal paper by Curticapean, Dell and Marx (STOC'17). We show that, among linear combinations of functions #IndSub(H,*) involving only graphs H without isolated vertices, precisely those with positive integer coefficients maintain a combinatorial interpretation. It is important to note that graph motif parameters can be nonnegative for all inputs G, even when some coefficients are negative. Formally, we show that evaluating any graph motif parameter with a negative coefficient is impossible in an oracle variant of #P, where an implicit graph is accessed by oracle queries. Our proof follows the classification of the relativizing closure properties of #P by Hertrampf, Vollmer, and Wagner (SCT'95) and the framework developed by Ikenmeyer and Pak (STOC'22), but our application of the required Ramsey theorem turns out to be more subtle, as graphs do not have the required Ramsey property. Our techniques generalize from graphs to relational structures, including colored graphs. Vastly generalizing this, we introduce motif parameters over categories that count occurrences of sub-objects in the category. We then prove a general dichotomy theorem that characterizes which such parameters have a combinatorial interpretation. Using known results in Ramsey theory for categories, we obtain a dichotomy for motif parameters of finite vector spaces as well as parameter sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, full version</p></details> |

This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity connections across frames. We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models to discriminate between coherent image sequences and stories from unrelated images. We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to teach appropriate entity connection behavior. We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic contexts. Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on Qwen2.5-VL 7B). Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1 from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%). Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except "its", and cross-frame character and object persistence increased across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%). Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story, increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[SQLNet: Scale-Modulated Query and Localization Network for Few-Shot Class-Agnostic Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10011v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The class-agnostic counting (CAC) task has recently been proposed to solve the problem of counting all objects of an arbitrary class with several exemplars given in the input image. To address this challenging task, existing leading methods all resort to density map regression, which renders them impractical for downstream tasks that require object locations and restricts their ability to well explore the scale information of exemplars for supervision. To address the limitations, we propose a novel localization-based CAC approach, termed Scale-modulated Query and Localization Network (SQLNet). It fully explores the scales of exemplars in both the query and localization stages and achieves effective counting by accurately locating each object and predicting its approximate size. Specifically, during the query stage, rich discriminative representations of the target class are acquired by the Hierarchical Exemplars Collaborative Enhancement (HECE) module from the few exemplars through multi-scale exemplar cooperation with equifrequent size prompt embedding. These representations are then fed into the Exemplars-Unified Query Correlation (EUQC) module to interact with the query features in a unified manner and produce the correlated query tensor. In the localization stage, the Scale-aware Multi-head Localization (SAML) module utilizes the query tensor to predict the confidence, location, and size of each potential object. Moreover, a scale-aware localization loss is introduced, which exploits flexible location associations and exemplar scales for supervision to optimize the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SQLNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular CAC benchmarks, achieving excellent performance not only in counting accuracy but also in localization and bounding box generation.

Representative methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness. Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147, CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability for zero-shot class-agnostic counting.

| **[Prompt-Free Conditional Diffusion for Multi-object Image Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06146v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models has underpinned much recent advances of dataset augmentation in various computer vision tasks. However, when involving generating multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images, resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization capabilities.

In this work, we present the first large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions: (1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3) How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context? Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key areas for improvement in medical visual language models.</p></details> |  |

We release a novel dataset, VAQUUM, containing 20,300 human ratings on quantified statements across a total of 1089 images. Using this dataset, we compare human judgments and VLM predictions using three different evaluation methods. Our findings show that VLMs, like humans, are influenced by object counts in vague quantifier use.

To address these limitations, we propose MIRAGE, a multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate models' capabilities in Counting (object attribute recognition), Relation (spatial relational reasoning), and Counting with Relation. Through diverse and complex scenarios requiring fine-grained recognition and reasoning, MIRAGE highlights critical limitations in state-of-the-art models, underscoring the need for improved representations and reasoning frameworks.

| **[On the Theory of Conditional Feature Alignment for Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17137v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object counting models suffer when deployed across domains with differing density variety, since density shifts are inherently task-relevant and violate standard domain adaptation assumptions. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets (e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in unsupervised domain-adaptive counting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with varying density distributions. The results show that our method outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Unlike prior approaches that mostly rely on deterministic part pose prediction and category-specific training, Assembler is designed to handle diverse, in-the-wild objects with varying part counts, geometries, and structures. It addresses the core challenges of scaling to general 3D part assembly through innovations in task formulation, representation, and data. First, Assembler casts part assembly as a generative problem and employs diffusion models to sample plausible configurations, effectively capturing ambiguities arising from symmetry, repeated parts, and multiple valid assemblies. Second, we introduce a novel shape-centric representation based on sparse anchor point clouds, enabling scalable generation in Euclidean space rather than SE(3) pose prediction. Third, we construct a large-scale dataset of over 320K diverse part-object assemblies using a synthesis and filtering pipeline built on existing 3D shape repositories. Assembler achieves state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and is the first to demonstrate high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects. Based on Assembler, we further introduce an interesting part-aware 3D modeling system that generates high-resolution, editable objects from images, demonstrating potential for interactive and compositional design.

Despite the success of AI as a service for multi-modal applications, it relies heavily on clouds, which are constrained by bandwidth, latency, privacy concerns, and unavailability under network or server failures. While on-device AI becomes popular, supporting multiple tasks on edge devices imposes significant resource challenges. To address this, we introduce S2M3, a split-and-share multi-modal architecture for multi-task inference on edge devices. Inspired by the general-purpose nature of multi-modal models, which are composed of multiple modules (encoder, decoder, classifier, etc.), we propose to split multi-modal models at functional-level modules; and then share common modules to reuse them across tasks, thereby reducing resource usage. To address cross-model dependency arising from module sharing, we propose a greedy module-level placement with per-request parallel routing by prioritizing compute-intensive modules. Through experiments on a testbed consisting of 14 multi-modal models across 5 tasks and 10 benchmarks, we demonstrate that S2M3 can reduce memory usage by up to 50% and 62% in single-task and multi-task settings, respectively, without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, S2M3 achieves optimal placement in 89 out of 95 instances (93.7%) while reducing inference latency by up to 56.9% on resource-constrained devices, compared to cloud AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2025)</p></details> |

Open-vocabulary approaches promise to close this gap through language-image pretraining on billions of image-caption pairs. Unfortunately, we observe that the promise is not delivered due to several bottlenecks that have caused the performance to plateau for almost two years. This paper proposes novel oracle components that identify and decouple these bottlenecks by taking advantage of the groundtruth information. The presented validation experiments deliver important empirical findings that provide a deeper insight into the failures of open-vocabulary models and suggest prominent approaches to unlock the future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ICCV 25 Workshop: What is Next in Multimodal Foundation Models?</p></details> |
| **[Dual Prompt Learning for Adapting Vision-Language Models to Downstream Image-Text Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04028v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm, DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7figures |
| **[Landsat30-AU: A Vision-Language Dataset for Australian Landsat Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03127v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term, high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components: Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing $196,262$ image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA, comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and boosts VQA accuracy from 0.74 to 0.87.

UCCT formalizes this process as Bayesian competition between statistical priors learned in pre-training and context-driven target patterns, yielding a single quantitative account that unifies existing adaptation techniques. We ground the theory in three principles: threshold crossing, modality universality, and density-distance predictive power, and validate them with (i) cross-domain demonstrations (text QA, image captioning, multi-agent debate) and (ii) two depth-oriented experiments: a controlled numeral-base study (bases 8, 9, 10) that isolates pattern-density effects, and a layer-wise trajectory analysis that reveals phase transitions inside a 7B-parameter model. Both experiments confirm UCCT's predictions of threshold behavior, asymmetric interference, and memory hysteresis. By showing that LLM ``intelligence'' is created through semantic anchoring rather than contained within the model, UCCT offers a principled foundation for interpretable diagnostics and practical guidance for prompt engineering, model selection, and alignment-centric system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figure, 2 table</p></details> |
| **[ChartCap: Mitigating Hallucination of Dense Chart Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03164v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific, dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight)</p></details> |
| **[How Can Objects Help Video-Language Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07454v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Do we still need to represent objects explicitly in multimodal large language models (MLLMs)? To one extreme, pre-trained encoders convert images into visual tokens, with which objects and spatiotemporal relationships may be implicitly modeled. To the other extreme, image captions by themselves provide strong empirical performances for understanding tasks, despite missing fine-grained spatiotemporal information. To answer this question, we introduce ObjectMLLM, a framework capable of leveraging arbitrary computer vision algorithm to extract and integrate structured visual representation. Through extensive evaluations on six video question answering benchmarks, we confirm that explicit integration of object-centric representation remains necessary. Surprisingly, we observe that the simple approach of quantizing the continuous, structured object information and representing them as plain text performs the best, offering a data-efficient approach to integrate other visual perception modules into MLLM design. Our code and models are released at https://github.com/brown-palm/ObjectMLLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rainbow Noise: Stress-Testing Multimodal Harmful-Meme Detectors on LGBTQ Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19551v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hateful memes aimed at LGBTQ\,+ communities often evade detection by tweaking either the caption, the image, or both. We build the first robustness benchmark for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted, lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger defences.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Beyond the Visible: Multispectral Vision-Language Learning for Earth Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15969v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models for Earth observation (EO) typically rely on the visual spectrum of data as the only model input, thus failing to leverage the rich spectral information available in the multispectral channels recorded by satellites. Therefore, we introduce Llama3-MS-CLIP, the first vision-language model pre-trained with contrastive learning on a large-scale multispectral dataset and report on the performance gains due to the extended spectral range. Furthermore, we present the largest-to-date image-caption dataset for multispectral data, consisting of one million Sentinel-2 samples and corresponding textual descriptions generated using Llama3-LLaVA-Next and Overture Maps data. We develop a scalable captioning pipeline, which is validated by domain experts. We evaluate Llama3-MS-CLIP on multispectral zero-shot image classification and retrieval using three datasets of varying complexity. Our results demonstrate that Llama3-MS-CLIP significantly outperforms other RGB-based approaches, improving classification accuracy by +6.77% on average and retrieval performance by +4.63% mAP compared to the second-best model. Our results emphasize the relevance of multispectral vision-language learning. The image-caption dataset, code, and model weights are available at https://github.com/IBM/MS-CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases.

| **[SGCap: Decoding Semantic Group for Zero-shot Video Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01270v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored. Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships. Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision (PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvccn/SGCap_Video.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Information Loss under High Pruning Rates for Efficient Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01236v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method (ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates. Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6% with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving Multimodal Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings with Object-Phrase Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00332v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal sentence embedding models typically leverage image-caption pairs in addition to textual data during training. However, such pairs often contain noise, including redundant or irrelevant information on either the image or caption side. To mitigate this issue, we propose MCSEO, a method that enhances multimodal sentence embeddings by incorporating fine-grained object-phrase alignment alongside traditional image-caption alignment. Specifically, MCSEO utilizes existing segmentation and object detection models to extract accurate object-phrase pairs, which are then used to optimize a contrastive learning objective tailored to object-phrase correspondence. Experimental results on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks across different backbone models demonstrate that MCSEO consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the significance of precise object-phrase alignment in multimodal representation learning.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[HumaniBench: A Human-Centric Framework for Large Multimodal Models Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11454v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) have been widely tested on tasks like visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, and grounding, but lack rigorous evaluation for alignment with human-centered (HC) values such as fairness, ethics, and inclusivity. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{HumaniBench}, a novel benchmark of 32,000 real-world image-question pairs and an evaluation suite. Labels are generated via an AI-assisted pipeline and validated by experts. HumaniBench assesses LMMs across seven key alignment principles: fairness, ethics, empathy, inclusivity, reasoning, robustness, and multilinguality, through diverse open-ended and closed-ended VQA tasks. Grounded in AI ethics and real-world needs, these principles provide a holistic lens for societal impact. Benchmarking results on different LMM shows that proprietary models generally lead in reasoning, fairness, and multilinguality, while open-source models excel in robustness and grounding. Most models struggle to balance accuracy with ethical and inclusive behavior. Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time scaling improve alignment. As the first benchmark tailored for HC alignment, HumaniBench offers a rigorous testbed to diagnose limitations, and promote responsible LMM development. All data and code are publicly available for reproducibility. Keywords: HumaniBench, vision-language models, responsible AI benchmark, AI alignment evaluation, AI ethics assessment, fairness in AI models, visual question answering (VQA) benchmark, image captioning evaluation, visual grounding tasks, trustworthy AI models, Chain-of-Thought prompting, test-time scaling, ethical AI development tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolParser: End-to-end Visual Recognition of Molecule Structures in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11098v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent decades, chemistry publications and patents have increased rapidly. A significant portion of key information is embedded in molecular structure figures, complicating large-scale literature searches and limiting the application of large language models in fields such as biology, chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. The automatic extraction of precise chemical structures is of critical importance. However, the presence of numerous Markush structures in real-world documents, along with variations in molecular image quality, drawing styles, and noise, significantly limits the performance of existing optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) methods. We present MolParser, a novel end-to-end OCSR method that efficiently and accurately recognizes chemical structures from real-world documents, including difficult Markush structure. We use a extended SMILES encoding rule to annotate our training dataset. Under this rule, we build MolParser-7M, the largest annotated molecular image dataset to our knowledge. While utilizing a large amount of synthetic data, we employed active learning methods to incorporate substantial in-the-wild data, specifically samples cropped from real patents and scientific literature, into the training process. We trained an end-to-end molecular image captioning model, MolParser, using a curriculum learning approach. MolParser significantly outperforms classical and learning-based methods across most scenarios, with potential for broader downstream applications. The dataset is publicly available in huggingface.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Invertibility of Multimodal Latent Spaces: Limitations of Optimization-Based Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23010v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence) models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g., text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio (Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities. Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings. Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens. These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces, primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.</p></details> |  |

However, such resources are often limited due to privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs) offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case subgroup performance.

However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers, posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of 0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing prenatal care in resource-limited settings.

To address this gap, we introduce ComicsPAP, a large-scale benchmark designed for comic strip understanding. Comprising over 100k samples and organized into 5 subtasks under a Pick-a-Panel framework, ComicsPAP demands models to identify the missing panel in a sequence. Our evaluations, conducted under both multi-image and single-image protocols, reveal that current state-of-the-art LMMs perform near chance on these tasks, underscoring significant limitations in capturing sequential and contextual dependencies. To close the gap, we adapted LMMs for comic strip understanding, obtaining better results on ComicsPAP than 10x bigger models, demonstrating that ComicsPAP offers a robust resource to drive future research in multimodal comic comprehension.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable limitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information. To address this constraint, researchers have endeavored to integrate visual capabilities with LLMs, resulting in the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These advanced models are instrumental in tackling more intricate tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. In our comprehensive survey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our classification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated to vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to generate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce multimodal inputs and outputs.This classification is based on their respective capabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various modalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive analysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as its strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of its essential components. We also analyzed the performance of VLMs in various benchmark datasets. By doing so, we aim to offer a nuanced understanding of the diverse landscape of VLMs. Additionally, we underscore potential avenues for future research in this dynamic domain, anticipating further breakthroughs and advancements.</p></details> | <details><summary>One o...</summary><p>One of the first survey on Visual Language Models</p></details> |

To tackle this challenge, we introduce OSG Navigator, a modular system composed of foundation models, for open-world Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav). Foundation models provide enormous semantic knowledge about the world, but struggle to organise and maintain spatial information effectively at scale. Key to OSG Navigator is the Open Scene Graph representation, which acts as spatial memory for OSG Navigator. It organises spatial information hierarchically using OSG schemas, which are templates, each describing the common structure of a class of environments. OSG schemas can be automatically generated from simple semantic labels of a given environment, e.g., "home" or "supermarket". They enable OSG Navigator to adapt zero-shot to new environment types. We conducted experiments using both Fetch and Spot robots in simulation and in the real world, showing that OSG Navigator achieves state-of-the-art performance on ObjectNav benchmarks and generalises zero-shot over diverse goals, environments, and robot embodiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>In IJ...</summary><p>In IJRR Special Issue: Foundation Models and Neuro-symbolic AI for Robotics.

Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 14 pages |

In this study, we consider the problem of estimating state variables and parameters in epidemiological models governed by ordinary differential equations using PINNs. In practice, not all trajectory data corresponding to the population described by models can be measured. Learning PINNs to estimate the unmeasured state variables and epidemiological parameters using partial measurements is challenging. Accordingly, we introduce the concept of algebraic observability of the state variables. Specifically, we propose augmenting the unmeasured data based on algebraic observability analysis. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments under three scenarios in the context of epidemiological modelling. Specifically, given noisy and partial measurements, the accuracy of unmeasured states and parameter estimation of the proposed method is shown to be higher than that of the conventional methods. The proposed method is also shown to be effective in practical scenarios, such as when the data corresponding to certain variables cannot be reconstructed from the measurements.</p></details> |  |

While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding, their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction. Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost.

However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise. To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed, and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community contributions and dataset evolution.</p></details> |  |

Prior work on risk estimation either outputs coarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes indicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses narrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk Index (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks based on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting control commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning within a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) principles, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation, and an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate CRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using a state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our collision-rate metrics show a 19\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions per failed route, a 20\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a 17\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically significant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6 ms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially improves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while maintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.</p></details> | ITSC 2025, 7 pages |

While recent advances in large language models have greatly improved performance, most existing approaches depend on models with tens of billions of parameters or costly APIs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments. For real world, especially on edge devices, it is crucial for Text-to-SQL to ensure cost-effectiveness. Therefore, enabling the light-weight models for Text-to-SQL is of great practical significance. However, smaller LLMs often struggle with complicated user instruction, redundant schema linking or syntax correctness. To address these challenges, we propose MCTS-SQL, a novel framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide SQL generation through multi-step refinement. Since the light-weight models' weak performance of single-shot prediction, we generate better results through several trials with feedback. However, directly applying MCTS-based methods inevitably leads to significant time and computational overhead. Driven by this issue, we propose a token-level prefix-cache mechanism that stores prior information during iterations, effectively improved the execution speed. Experiments results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using a small open-source Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B, our method outperforms ChatGPT-3.5. When leveraging a more powerful model Gemini 2.5 to explore the performance upper bound, we achieved results competitive with the SOTA. Our findings demonstrate that even small models can be effectively deployed in practical Text-to-SQL systems with the right strategy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

However, current learning-based methods often struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency: methods that achieve high accuracy typically demand substantial processing power, while faster approaches tend to sacrifice precision. These fast approaches specifically falter in their generalization capabilities and do not perform well across diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we revisit the limitations of the SOTA methods and present NeuFlow-V2, a novel method that offers both - high accuracy in real-world datasets coupled with low computational overhead. In particular, we introduce a novel light-weight backbone and a fast refinement module to keep computational demands tractable while delivering accurate optical flow. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NeuFlow-V2 provides similar accuracy to SOTA methods while achieving 10x-70x speedups. It is capable of running at over 20 FPS on 512x384 resolution images on a Jetson Orin Nano.

| **[Light-Weight Diffusion Multiplier and Uncertainty Quantification for Fourier Neural Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00643v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operator learning is a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential equations, with Fourier Neural Operators serving as a widely adopted foundation. However, FNOs face significant scalability challenges due to overparameterization and offer no native uncertainty quantification -- a key requirement for reliable scientific and engineering applications. Instead, neural operators rely on post hoc UQ methods that ignore geometric inductive biases. In this work, we introduce DINOZAUR: a diffusion-based neural operator parametrization with uncertainty quantification. Inspired by the structure of the heat kernel, DINOZAUR replaces the dense tensor multiplier in FNOs with a dimensionality-independent diffusion multiplier that has a single learnable time parameter per channel, drastically reducing parameter count and memory footprint without compromising predictive performance. By defining priors over those time parameters, we cast DINOZAUR as a Bayesian neural operator to yield spatially correlated outputs and calibrated uncertainty estimates. Our method achieves competitive or superior performance across several PDE benchmarks while providing efficient uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we present an autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) system which purely relies on cost-effective and light-weight passive visual and inertial sensors to perform large-scale autonomous navigation in outdoor,unstructured and cluttered environments. We leverage visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) for accurate MAV state estimates and couple it with a volumetric occupancy submapping system to achieve a scalable mapping framework which can be directly used for path planning. To ensure the safety of the MAV during navigation, we also propose a novel reference trajectory anchoring scheme that deforms the reference trajectory the MAV is tracking upon state updates from the VI-SLAM system in a consistent way, even upon large state updates due to loop-closures. We thoroughly validate our system in both real and simulated forest environments and at peak velocities up to 3 m/s while not encountering a single collision or system failure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system which achieves this level of performance in such an unstructured environment using low-cost passive visual sensors and fully on-board computation, including VI-SLAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Specifically, it takes in 32 input images at a resolution of 960x540 and produces the Gaussian reconstruction in just 1 second on a single A100 GPU. To handle the long sequence of 250K tokens brought by the large input size, Long-LRM features a mixture of the recent Mamba2 blocks and the classical transformer blocks, enhanced by a light-weight token merging module and Gaussian pruning steps that balance between quality and efficiency. We evaluate Long-LRM on the large-scale DL3DV benchmark and Tanks&Temples, demonstrating reconstruction quality comparable to the optimization-based methods while achieving an 800x speedup w.r.t. the optimization-based approaches and an input size at least 60x larger than the previous feed-forward approaches. We conduct extensive ablation studies on our model design choices for both rendering quality and computation efficiency. We also explore Long-LRM's compatibility with other Gaussian variants such as 2D GS, which enhances Long-LRM's ability in geometry reconstruction.

| **[Optimizing against Infeasible Inclusions from Data for Semantic Segmentation through Morphology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14672v6)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art semantic segmentation models are typically optimized in a data-driven fashion, minimizing solely per-pixel or per-segment classification objectives on their training data. This purely data-driven paradigm often leads to absurd segmentations, especially when the domain of input images is shifted from the one encountered during training. For instance, state-of-the-art models may assign the label "road" to a segment that is included by another segment that is respectively labeled as "sky". However, the ground truth of the existing dataset at hand dictates that such inclusion is not feasible. Our method, Infeasible Semantic Inclusions (InSeIn), first extracts explicit inclusion constraints that govern spatial class relations from the semantic segmentation training set at hand in an offline, data-driven fashion, and then enforces a morphological yet differentiable loss that penalizes violations of these constraints during training to promote prediction feasibility. InSeIn is a light-weight plug-and-play method, constitutes a novel step towards minimizing infeasible semantic inclusions in the predictions of learned segmentation models, and yields consistent and significant performance improvements over diverse state-of-the-art networks across the ADE20K, Cityscapes, and ACDC datasets. https://github.com/SHAMIK-97/InSeIn</p></details> |  |

Accurate VAD is essential in automatic speech recognition, voice-to-text, conversational agents, etc, where noise can severely degrade the performance. A modern application includes the voice assistant, specially mounted on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) devices such as cell phones, smart glasses, earbuds, etc, where the voice signal includes background noise. Therefore, VAD modules must remain light-weight due to their practical on-device limitation. The existing models often struggle with low signal-to-noise ratios across diverse acoustic environments. A simple VAD often detects human voice in a clean environment, but struggles to detect the human voice in noisy conditions. We propose a noise-robust VAD that comprises a light-weight VAD, with data pre-processing and post-processing added modules to handle the background noise. This approach significantly enhances the VAD accuracy in noisy environments and requires neither a larger model, nor fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a notable improvement compared to baselines, particularly in environments with high background noise interference. This modified VAD additionally improving clean speech detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Hamed...</summary><p>Hamed Jafarzadeh Asl and Mahsa Ghazvini Nejad contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

To address this, we propose Forward-Backward RAG (FB-RAG), a new training-free framework based on a simple yet powerful forward-looking strategy. FB-RAG employs a light-weight LLM to peek into potential future generations, using evidence from multiple sampled outputs to precisely identify the most relevant context for a final, more powerful generator. This improves performance without complex finetuning or Reinforcement Learning common in prior work. Across 9 datasets, FB-RAG consistently delivers strong results. Further, the performance gains can be achieved with reduced latency due to a shorter, more focused prompt for the powerful generator. On EN.QA dataset, FB-RAG matches the leading baseline with over 48% latency reduction or achieves an 8% performance improvement with a 10% latency reduction. Our analysis finds cases where even when the forward-looking LLM fails to generate correct answers, its attempts are sufficient to guide the final model to an accurate response, demonstrating how smaller LLMs can systematically improve the performance and efficiency of larger ones.</p></details> |  |

Although existing super-resolution-based methods show promising results on public datasets, they often rely on idealized assumptions like accurate region correspondences and reliable dToF inputs, overlooking calibration errors that cause misalignment and anomaly signals inherent to dToF imaging, limiting real-world applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel completion-based method, named DEPTHOR, featuring advances in both the training strategy and model architecture. First, we propose a method to simulate real-world dToF data from the accurate ground truth in synthetic datasets to enable noise-robust training. Second, we design a novel network that incorporates monocular depth estimation (MDE), leveraging global depth relationships and contextual information to improve prediction in challenging regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset, our training strategy significantly enhances depth completion models, achieving results comparable to depth super-resolution methods, while our model achieves state-of-the-art results, improving Rel and RMSE by 27% and 18%, respectively. On a more challenging set of dToF samples we collected, our method outperforms SOTA methods on preliminary stereo-based GT, improving Rel and RMSE by 23% and 22%, respectively.

Conventional RGB-D visual odometry(RGBD-VO) often relies on iterative optimization solvers to estimate pose and involves a process of feature extraction and matching. This results in significant computational burden and time delays. To address this, our innovative method for RGBD-VO separates the estimation of rotation and translation. Initially, we exploit the overlaid planar characteristics within the scene to calculate the rotation matrix. Following this, we utilize a kernel cross-correlator (KCC) to ascertain the translation. By sidestepping the resource-intensive iterative optimization and feature extraction and alignment procedures, our methodology offers improved computational efficacy, achieving a performance of 71Hz on a lower-end i5 CPU. When the RGBD-VO does not rely on feature points, our technique exhibits enhanced performance in low-texture degenerative environments compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, this paradigm faces fundamental challenges: subjective tasks often lack absolute ground truth, and sparse annotation coverage makes aggregation statistically unreliable. We introduce a paradigm shift from sample-wise aggregation to annotator-wise behavior modeling. By treating annotator disagreements as valuable information rather than noise, modeling annotator-specific behavior patterns can reconstruct unlabeled data to reduce annotation cost, enhance aggregation reliability, and explain annotator decision behavior. To this end, we propose QuMATL (Query-based Multi-Annotator Behavior Pattern Learning), which uses light-weight queries to model individual annotators while capturing inter-annotator correlations as implicit regularization, preventing overfitting to sparse individual data while maintaining individualization and improving generalization, with a visualization of annotator focus regions offering an explainable analysis of behavior understanding. We contribute two large-scale datasets with dense per-annotator labels: STREET (4,300 labels/annotator) and AMER (average 3,118 labels/annotator), the first multimodal multi-annotator dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.15237</p></details> |

The paper establishes, for small sources, the existence of solutions on the continuous and discrete level of lowest-order piecewise divergence-free Crouzeix--Raviart finite elements. The vorticity employs a vector version of the pressure space with normal and tangential velocity jump penalisation terms. A simple Raviart--Thomas interpolant leads to pressure-robust a priori error estimates. An explicit residual-based a posteriori error estimate allows for efficient and reliable a posteriori error control. The efficiency for the Forchheimer nonlinearity requires a novel discrete inequality of independent interest. The implementation is based upon a light-weight forest-of-trees data structure handled by a highly parallel set of adaptive mesh refining algorithms. Numerical simulations reveal robustness of the a posteriori error estimates and improved convergence rates by adaptive mesh-refining.</p></details> |  |

Continual learning is supposed to help train models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection). Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MICCAI 2024 workshop on Efficient Medical AI</p></details> |
| **[Learning New Concepts, Remembering the Old: Continual Learning for Multimodal Concept Bottleneck Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17471v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance the interpretability of AI systems, particularly by bridging visual input with human-understandable concepts, effectively acting as a form of multimodal interpretability model. However, existing CBMs typically assume static datasets, which fundamentally limits their adaptability to real-world, continuously evolving multimodal data streams. To address this, we define a novel continual learning task for CBMs: simultaneously handling concept-incremental and class-incremental learning. This task requires models to continuously acquire new concepts (often representing cross-modal attributes) and classes while robustly preserving previously learned knowledge. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose CONceptual Continual Incremental Learning (CONCIL), a novel framework that fundamentally re-imagines concept and decision layer updates as linear regression problems. This reformulation eliminates the need for gradient-based optimization, thereby effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, CONCIL relies solely on recursive matrix operations, rendering it highly computationally efficient and well-suited for real-time and large-scale multimodal data applications. Experimental results compellingly demonstrate that CONCIL achieves "absolute knowledge memory" and significantly surpasses the performance of traditional CBM methods in both concept- and class-incremental settings, thus establishing a new paradigm for continual learning in CBMs, particularly valuable for dynamic multimodal understanding.</p></details> |  |

Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study, we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, segmentation models trained on static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work, we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than 144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at http://topics.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Recently, replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this, exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other replay-based methods, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However, these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy.

| **[Prompt-Based Exemplar Super-Compression and Regeneration for Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18266v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Replay-based methods in class-incremental learning (CIL) have attained remarkable success. Despite their effectiveness, the inherent memory restriction results in saving a limited number of exemplars with poor diversity. In this paper, we introduce PESCR, a novel approach that substantially increases the quantity and enhances the diversity of exemplars based on a pre-trained general-purpose diffusion model, without fine-tuning it on target datasets or storing it in the memory buffer. Images are compressed into visual and textual prompts, which are saved instead of the original images, decreasing memory consumption by a factor of 24. In subsequent phases, diverse exemplars are regenerated by the diffusion model. We further propose partial compression and diffusion-based data augmentation to minimize the domain gap between generated exemplars and real images. PESCR significantly improves CIL performance across multiple benchmarks, e.g., 3.2% above the previous state-of-the-art on ImageNet-100.</p></details> | <details><summary>BMVC ...</summary><p>BMVC 2025.

| **[RainbowPrompt: Diversity-Enhanced Prompt-Evolving for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22553v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods across all scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[CLoRA: Parameter-Efficient Continual Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19887v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past, continual learning (CL) was mostly concerned with the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, that arises when incrementally learning a sequence of tasks. Current CL methods function within the confines of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA, we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CoLLAs 2025</p></details> |
| **[External Knowledge Injection for CLIP-Based Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08510v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables learning systems to continuously adapt to evolving data streams. With the advancement of pre-training, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) offers a promising starting point for CIL. However, CLIP makes decisions by matching visual embeddings to class names, overlooking the rich contextual information conveyed through language. For instance, the concept of ``cat'' can be decomposed into features like tail, fur, and face for recognition. Besides, since the model is continually updated, these detailed features are overwritten in CIL, requiring external knowledge for compensation. In this paper, we introduce ExterNal knowledGe INjEction (ENGINE) for CLIP-based CIL. To enhance knowledge transfer from outside the dataset, we propose a dual-branch injection tuning framework that encodes informative knowledge from both visual and textual modalities. The visual branch is enhanced with data augmentation to enrich the visual features, while the textual branch leverages GPT-4 to rewrite discriminative descriptors. In addition to this on-the-fly knowledge injection, we also implement post-tuning knowledge by re-ranking the prediction results during inference. With the injected knowledge, the model can better capture informative features for downstream tasks as data evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ENGINE.

| **[Towards Effective Open-set Graph Class-incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17687v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph class-incremental learning (GCIL) allows graph neural networks (GNNs) to adapt to evolving graph analytical tasks by incrementally learning new class knowledge while retaining knowledge of old classes. Existing GCIL methods primarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed to belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge during inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a more challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two intertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs the detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which destabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems, a novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding generation to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust detection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional variational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old classes, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle unknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node embeddings. A novel prototypical hypersphere classification loss is further proposed, which anchors in-distribution embeddings to their respective class prototypes, while repelling OOD embeddings away. Instead of assigning all unknown samples into one cluster, our proposed objective function explicitly models them as outliers through prototype-aware rejection regions, ensuring a robust open-set recognition. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of OGCIL over existing GCIL and open-set GNN methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Continual Generalized Category Discovery: Learning and Forgetting from a Bayesian Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17382v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) faces a critical challenge: incrementally learning new classes from unlabeled data streams while preserving knowledge of old classes. Existing methods struggle with catastrophic forgetting, especially when unlabeled data mixes known and novel categories. We address this by analyzing C-GCD's forgetting dynamics through a Bayesian lens, revealing that covariance misalignment between old and new classes drives performance degradation. Building on this insight, we propose Variational Bayes C-GCD (VB-CGCD), a novel framework that integrates variational inference with covariance-aware nearest-class-mean classification. VB-CGCD adaptively aligns class distributions while suppressing pseudo-label noise via stochastic variational updates. Experiments show VB-CGCD surpasses prior art by +15.21% with the overall accuracy in the final session on standard benchmarks. We also introduce a new challenging benchmark with only 10% labeled data and extended online phases, VB-CGCD achieves a 67.86% final accuracy, significantly higher than state-of-the-art (38.55%), demonstrating its robust applicability across diverse scenarios.

| **[Scaled Relative Graph Analysis of General Interconnections of SISO Nonlinear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15564v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency-domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems. However, we show that the current SRG analysis suffers from a pitfall that limits its applicability in analyzing practical nonlinear systems. We overcome this pitfall by introducing a novel reformulation of the SRG of a linear time-invariant operator and combining the SRG with the Nyquist criterion. The result is a theorem that can be used to assess stability and $L_2$-gain performance for general interconnections of nonlinear dynamic systems. We provide practical calculation results for canonical interconnections and apply our result to Lur'e systems to obtain a generalization of the celebrated circle criterion, which deals with broader class of nonlinearities, and we derive (incremental) $L_2$-gain performance bounds. We illustrate the power of the new approach on the analysis of several examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vector Quantization Prompting for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20444v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning requires to overcome catastrophic forgetting when training a single model on a sequence of tasks. Recent top-performing approaches are prompt-based methods that utilize a set of learnable parameters (i.e., prompts) to encode task knowledge, from which appropriate ones are selected to guide the fixed pre-trained model in generating features tailored to a certain task. However, existing methods rely on predicting prompt identities for prompt selection, where the identity prediction process cannot be optimized with task loss. This limitation leads to sub-optimal prompt selection and inadequate adaptation of pre-trained features for a specific task. Previous efforts have tried to address this by directly generating prompts from input queries instead of selecting from a set of candidates. However, these prompts are continuous, which lack sufficient abstraction for task knowledge representation, making them less effective for continual learning. To address these challenges, we propose VQ-Prompt, a prompt-based continual learning method that incorporates Vector Quantization (VQ) into end-to-end training of a set of discrete prompts. In this way, VQ-Prompt can optimize the prompt selection process with task loss and meanwhile achieve effective abstraction of task knowledge for continual learning. Extensive experiments show that VQ-Prompt outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods across a variety of benchmarks under the challenging class-incremental setting.

| **[Revisiting Pool-based Prompt Learning for Few-shot Class-incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09183v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks, revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding, we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental learning. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Jywsuperman/LGSP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025, 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[Noradrenergic-inspired gain modulation attenuates the stability gap in joint training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14056v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning, revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably, persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps. Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap. Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 1 pseudo-code</p></details> |
| **[Foundation Models as Class-Incremental Learners for Dermatological Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14050v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models (FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization, replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real world medical applications.

We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions. Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>6th C...</summary><p>6th CLVISION ICCV Workshop accepted</p></details> |
| **[Decoupled PROB: Decoupled Query Initialization Tasks and Objectness-Class Learning for Open World Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13085v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB) is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions. To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to WACV 2025 (Tucson, Arizona, USA), February 28-March 4 2025</p></details> |
