| **[Robustness Is a Function, Not a Number: A Factorized Comprehensive Study of OOD Robustness in Vision-Based Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09018v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out of distribution (OOD) robustness in autonomous driving is often reduced to a single number, hiding what breaks a policy. We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \in \{0,1,2,3\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost. (2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\rightarrow$ urban and day $\rightarrow$ night ($\sim 31\%$ each); actor swaps $\sim 10\%$, moderate rain $\sim 7\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance. (7) Scaling traces/views improves robustness ($+11.8$ points from $5$ to $14$ traces), yet targeted exposure to hard conditions can substitute for scale. (8) Using multiple ID environments broadens coverage and strengthens weak cases (urban OOD $60.6\% \rightarrow 70.1\%$) with a small ID drop; single-ID preserves peak performance but in a narrow domain. These results yield actionable design rules for OOD-robust driving policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArcFlow: Unleashing 2-Step Text-to-Image Generation via High-Precision Non-Linear Flow Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09014v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generation quality, but they suffer from significant inference cost due to their reliance on multiple sequential denoising steps, motivating recent efforts to distill this inference process into a few-step regime. However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of ArcFlow both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.

We establish a public, reproducible multi-dataset benchmark for lung nodule detection and nodule-level cancer classification and quantify cross-dataset generalizability. Using the Duke Lung Cancer Screening (DLCS) dataset as a clinically curated development set, we evaluate performance across LUNA16/LIDC-IDRI, NLST-3D, and LUNA25. Detection models trained on DLCS and LUNA16 were evaluated externally on NLST-3D using free-response ROC analysis. For malignancy classification, we compared five strategies: randomly initialized ResNet50, Models Genesis, Med3D, a Foundation Model for Cancer Biomarkers, and a Strategic Warm-Start (ResNet50-SWS) approach pretrained using detection-derived candidate patches stratified by confidence. Performance was summarized using AUC with 95% confidence intervals and DeLong tests. Detection performance varied substantially by training dataset, with DLCS-trained models outperforming LUNA16-trained models on external NLST-3D evaluation (sensitivity at 2 false positives per scan: 0.72 vs. 0.64; p < 0.001). For malignancy classification, ResNet50-SWS achieved AUCs of 0.71 (DLCS), 0.90 (LUNA16), 0.81 (NLST-3D), and 0.80 (LUNA25), consistently matching or exceeding alternative pretraining strategies. These results demonstrate that dataset characteristics strongly influence lung cancer AI performance and highlight the need for transparent, multi-dataset benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 tab...</summary><p>3 tables, 2 supplement tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

| **[IDALC: A Semi-Supervised Framework for Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05921v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Voice-controlled dialog systems have become immensely popular due to their ability to perform a wide range of actions in response to diverse user queries. These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1. Remarkably, we maintain the overall annotation cost at just 6-10% of the unlabelled data available to the system. The overall framework of IDALC is shown in Fig. 1</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (October 2025)</p></details> |

Benchmarking and Intervention-Based Auditing of LLM-Based Scholar Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08873v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for academic expert recommendation. Existing audits typically evaluate model outputs in isolation, largely ignoring end-user inference-time interventions. As a result, it remains unclear whether failures such as refusals, hallucinations, and uneven coverage stem from model choice or deployment decisions. We introduce LLMScholarBench, a benchmark for auditing LLM-based scholar recommendation that jointly evaluates model infrastructure and end-user interventions across multiple tasks. LLMScholarBench measures both technical quality and social representation using nine metrics. We instantiate the benchmark in physics expert recommendation and audit 22 LLMs under temperature variation, representation-constrained prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via web search. Our results show that end-user interventions do not yield uniform improvements but instead redistribute error across dimensions. Higher temperature degrades validity, consistency, and factuality. Representation-constrained prompting improves diversity at the expense of factuality, while RAG primarily improves technical quality while reducing diversity and parity. Overall, end-user interventions reshape trade-offs rather than providing a general fix. We release code and data that can be adapted to other disciplines by replacing domain-specific ground truth and metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages: 8 pages in main (5 figures, 1 table), 20 pages in appendix (18 figures, 2 tables). under-review</p></details> |
| **[ZK-Rollup for Hyperledger Fabric: Architecture and Performance Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08870v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A big challenge posed in blockchain centric platforms is achieving scalability while also preserving user privacy. This report details the design, implementation and evaluation of a Layer-2 scaling solution for Hyperledger Fabric using Zero Knowledge Rollups (ZK Rollups). The proposed architecture introduces an off chain sequencer that accepts transactions immediately and sends them for batching into a Merkle tree based rollup, using ZK proofs to attest to the correctness and verifiability of the entire batch. The design aims to decouple transaction ingestion from actual on chain settlements to address Fabric scalability limitations and increase throughput under high load conditions. The baseline architecture in Hyperledger Fabric constrains transaction requests due to endorsement, ordering and validation phases, leading to a throughput of 5 to 7 TPS with an average latency of 4 seconds. Our Layer-2 solution achieves an ingestion throughput of 70 to 100 TPS, leading to an increase of nearly ten times due to the sequencer immediate acceptance of each transaction and reducing client perceived latency by nearly eighty percent to 700 to 1000 milliseconds. This work demonstrates that integrating ZK Rollups in Hyperledger Fabric enhances scalability while not compromising the security guarantees of a permissioned blockchain network.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1. Remarkably, we maintain the overall annotation cost at just 6-10% of the unlabelled data available to the system. The overall framework of IDALC is shown in Fig. 1</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (October 2025)</p></details> |

Benchmarking and Intervention-Based Auditing of LLM-Based Scholar Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08873v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for academic expert recommendation. Existing audits typically evaluate model outputs in isolation, largely ignoring end-user inference-time interventions. As a result, it remains unclear whether failures such as refusals, hallucinations, and uneven coverage stem from model choice or deployment decisions. We introduce LLMScholarBench, a benchmark for auditing LLM-based scholar recommendation that jointly evaluates model infrastructure and end-user interventions across multiple tasks. LLMScholarBench measures both technical quality and social representation using nine metrics. We instantiate the benchmark in physics expert recommendation and audit 22 LLMs under temperature variation, representation-constrained prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via web search. Our results show that end-user interventions do not yield uniform improvements but instead redistribute error across dimensions. Higher temperature degrades validity, consistency, and factuality. Representation-constrained prompting improves diversity at the expense of factuality, while RAG primarily improves technical quality while reducing diversity and parity. Overall, end-user interventions reshape trade-offs rather than providing a general fix. We release code and data that can be adapted to other disciplines by replacing domain-specific ground truth and metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages: 8 pages in main (5 figures, 1 table), 20 pages in appendix (18 figures, 2 tables). under-review</p></details> |

This report details the design, implementation and evaluation of a Layer-2 scaling solution for Hyperledger Fabric using Zero Knowledge Rollups (ZK Rollups). The proposed architecture introduces an off chain sequencer that accepts transactions immediately and sends them for batching into a Merkle tree based rollup, using ZK proofs to attest to the correctness and verifiability of the entire batch. The design aims to decouple transaction ingestion from actual on chain settlements to address Fabric scalability limitations and increase throughput under high load conditions. The baseline architecture in Hyperledger Fabric constrains transaction requests due to endorsement, ordering and validation phases, leading to a throughput of 5 to 7 TPS with an average latency of 4 seconds. Our Layer-2 solution achieves an ingestion throughput of 70 to 100 TPS, leading to an increase of nearly ten times due to the sequencer immediate acceptance of each transaction and reducing client perceived latency by nearly eighty percent to 700 to 1000 milliseconds. This work demonstrates that integrating ZK Rollups in Hyperledger Fabric enhances scalability while not compromising the security guarantees of a permissioned blockchain network.</p></details> |  |

We systematically investigate the performance gap between discrete and continuous methods. Contrary to the belief that discrete tokenizers are intrinsically inferior, we demonstrate that the disparity arises primarily from the total number of bits allocated in the latent space (i.e., the compression ratio). We show that scaling up the codebook size effectively bridges this gap, allowing discrete tokenizers to match or surpass their continuous counterparts. However, existing discrete generation methods struggle to capitalize on this insight, suffering from performance degradation or prohibitive training costs with scaled codebook. To address this, we propose masked Bit AutoRegressive modeling (BAR), a scalable framework that supports arbitrary codebook sizes. By equipping an autoregressive transformer with a masked bit modeling head, BAR predicts discrete tokens through progressively generating their constituent bits. BAR achieves a new state-of-the-art gFID of 0.99 on ImageNet-256, outperforming leading methods across both continuous and discrete paradigms, while significantly reducing sampling costs and converging faster than prior continuous approaches.

We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \in \{0,1,2,3\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost. (2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\rightarrow$ urban and day $\rightarrow$ night ($\sim 31\%$ each); actor swaps $\sim 10\%$, moderate rain $\sim 7\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance. (7) Scaling traces/views improves robustness ($+11.8$ points from $5$ to $14$ traces), yet targeted exposure to hard conditions can substitute for scale. (8) Using multiple ID environments broadens coverage and strengthens weak cases (urban OOD $60.6\% \rightarrow 70.1\%$) with a small ID drop; single-ID preserves peak performance but in a narrow domain. These results yield actionable design rules for OOD-robust driving policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Categorical Reparameterization with Denoising Diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00781v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning models with categorical variables requires optimizing expectations over discrete distributions, a setting in which stochastic gradient-based optimization is challenging due to the non-differentiability of categorical sampling. A common workaround is to replace the discrete distribution with a continuous relaxation, yielding a smooth surrogate that admits reparameterized gradient estimates via the reparameterization trick. Building on this idea, we introduce ReDGE, a novel and efficient diffusion-based soft reparameterization method for categorical distributions. Our approach defines a flexible class of gradient estimators that includes the Straight-Through estimator as a special case. Experiments spanning latent variable models and inference-time reward guidance in discrete diffusion models demonstrate that ReDGE consistently matches or outperforms existing gradient-based methods. The code will be made available at https://github.com/samsongourevitch/redge.</p></details> | preprint |

However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of ArcFlow both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[ANCRe: Adaptive Neural Connection Reassignment for Efficient Depth Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09009v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling network depth has been a central driver behind the success of modern foundation models, yet recent investigations suggest that deep layers are often underutilized. This paper revisits the default mechanism for deepening neural networks, namely residual connections, from an optimization perspective. Rigorous analysis proves that the layout of residual connections can fundamentally shape convergence behavior, and even induces an exponential gap in convergence rates. Prompted by this insight, we introduce adaptive neural connection reassignment (ANCRe), a principled and lightweight framework that parameterizes and learns residual connectivities from the data. ANCRe adaptively reassigns residual connections with negligible computational and memory overhead ($<1\%$), while enabling more effective utilization of network depth. Extensive numerical tests across pre-training of large language models, diffusion models, and deep ResNets demonstrate consistently accelerated convergence, boosted performance, and enhanced depth efficiency over conventional residual connections.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.

While foundation models (FMs) trained on massive datasets demonstrate strong generalization by extracting general-purpose features, they can still suffer from scarce labeled data during downstream fine-tuning. To address this, we propose GeLDA, a semantics-aware generative latent data augmentation framework that leverages conditional diffusion models to synthesize samples in an FM-induced latent space. Because this space is low-dimensional and concentrates task-relevant information compared to the input space, GeLDA enables efficient, high-quality data generation. GeLDA conditions generation on auxiliary feature vectors that capture semantic relationships among classes or subdomains, facilitating data augmentation in low-resource domains. We validate GeLDA in two large-scale recognition tasks: (a) in zero-shot language-specific speech emotion recognition, GeLDA improves the Whisper-large baseline's unweighted average recall by 6.13%; and (b) in long-tailed image classification, it achieves 74.7% tail-class accuracy on ImageNet-LT, setting a new state-of-the-art result.</p></details> |  |

We establish a public, reproducible multi-dataset benchmark for lung nodule detection and nodule-level cancer classification and quantify cross-dataset generalizability. Using the Duke Lung Cancer Screening (DLCS) dataset as a clinically curated development set, we evaluate performance across LUNA16/LIDC-IDRI, NLST-3D, and LUNA25. Detection models trained on DLCS and LUNA16 were evaluated externally on NLST-3D using free-response ROC analysis. For malignancy classification, we compared five strategies: randomly initialized ResNet50, Models Genesis, Med3D, a Foundation Model for Cancer Biomarkers, and a Strategic Warm-Start (ResNet50-SWS) approach pretrained using detection-derived candidate patches stratified by confidence. Performance was summarized using AUC with 95% confidence intervals and DeLong tests. Detection performance varied substantially by training dataset, with DLCS-trained models outperforming LUNA16-trained models on external NLST-3D evaluation (sensitivity at 2 false positives per scan: 0.72 vs. 0.64; p < 0.001). For malignancy classification, ResNet50-SWS achieved AUCs of 0.71 (DLCS), 0.90 (LUNA16), 0.81 (NLST-3D), and 0.80 (LUNA25), consistently matching or exceeding alternative pretraining strategies. These results demonstrate that dataset characteristics strongly influence lung cancer AI performance and highlight the need for transparent, multi-dataset benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 tab...</summary><p>3 tables, 2 supplement tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve distributions that remain consistent to the nominal distribution while being diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose generative model-based ambiguity sets that capture various adversarial distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency with the nominal distribution. Building on this generative ambiguity modeling, we propose DRO with Generative Ambiguity Set (GAS-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner maximization over the parameterized generative model space. We formally establish the stationary convergence performance of GAS-DRO. We implement GAS-DRO with a diffusion model and empirically demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance in ML tasks.</p></details> |  |

While existing authentication mechanisms are available for interaction-rich devices such as smartwatches, enabling on-device authentication (ODA) on interaction-limited wearables including rings, earphones, glasses, and wristbands remains difficult. Moreover, as users increasingly own multiple smart devices, relying on device-specific authentication methods becomes redundant and burdensome. To address these challenges, we present PPGTransID, a ubiquitous and unobtrusive cross-device authentication (CDA) approach that leverages the real-time physiological consistency of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals across the human body. PPGTransID utilizes widely available PPG sensors on wearable devices to capture users' physiological signals and compares them with remote PPG (rPPG) signals extracted from a smartphone camera, where robust face-based authentication is already established. In doing so, PPGTransID securely transfers the reliable authentication status of the smartphone to nearby wearable devices without requiring additional user interaction. An evaluation with 33 participants shows that PPGTransID achieves a balanced accuracy of 95.5 percent and generalizes across multiple wearable form factors. Robustness experiments with 10 participants demonstrate resilience to variations in lighting, camera placement, and user behavior, while a real-time usability study with 14 participants confirms reliable performance with minimal interaction burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 5 tables, submitted to IMWUT 2026</p></details> |

The core of our method is a novel joint representation of dense 3D point maps and 3D scene flows in a shared coordinate system, and a novel 4D VAE to effectively learn this representation. Unlike prior work that forces the 3D value and latents to align strictly with RGB VAE latents-despite their fundamentally different distributions-we show that such alignment is unnecessary and leads to suboptimal performance. Instead, we introduce a new data normalization and VAE training strategy that better transfers diffusion priors and greatly improves reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that MotionCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in both geometry reconstruction and dense scene flow estimation, delivering 38.64% and 25.0% improvements in geometry and motion reconstruction, respectively, all without any post-optimization.

Yet, most existing pre-trained transformers do not have a principled mechanism for uncertainty propagation through their feature transformation stack. In this work, we propose a diffusion-inspired reconfiguration of transformers in which each feature transformation block is modeled as a probabilistic mapping. Composing these probabilistic mappings reveals a probability path that mimics the structure of a diffusion process, transporting data mass from the input distribution to the pre-trained feature distribution. This probability path can then be recompiled on a diffusion process with a unified transition model to enable principled propagation of representation uncertainty throughout the pre-trained model's architecture while maintaining its original predictive performance. Empirical results across a variety of vision and language benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior calibration and predictive accuracy compared to existing uncertainty-aware transformers.</p></details> |  |

We instantiate the benchmark in physics expert recommendation and audit 22 LLMs under temperature variation, representation-constrained prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via web search. Our results show that end-user interventions do not yield uniform improvements but instead redistribute error across dimensions. Higher temperature degrades validity, consistency, and factuality. Representation-constrained prompting improves diversity at the expense of factuality, while RAG primarily improves technical quality while reducing diversity and parity. Overall, end-user interventions reshape trade-offs rather than providing a general fix. We release code and data that can be adapted to other disciplines by replacing domain-specific ground truth and metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages: 8 pages in main (5 figures, 1 table), 20 pages in appendix (18 figures, 2 tables). under-review</p></details> |

This report details the design, implementation and evaluation of a Layer-2 scaling solution for Hyperledger Fabric using Zero Knowledge Rollups (ZK Rollups). The proposed architecture introduces an off chain sequencer that accepts transactions immediately and sends them for batching into a Merkle tree based rollup, using ZK proofs to attest to the correctness and verifiability of the entire batch. The design aims to decouple transaction ingestion from actual on chain settlements to address Fabric scalability limitations and increase throughput under high load conditions. The baseline architecture in Hyperledger Fabric constrains transaction requests due to endorsement, ordering and validation phases, leading to a throughput of 5 to 7 TPS with an average latency of 4 seconds. Our Layer-2 solution achieves an ingestion throughput of 70 to 100 TPS, leading to an increase of nearly ten times due to the sequencer immediate acceptance of each transaction and reducing client perceived latency by nearly eighty percent to 700 to 1000 milliseconds. This work demonstrates that integrating ZK Rollups in Hyperledger Fabric enhances scalability while not compromising the security guarantees of a permissioned blockchain network.</p></details> |  |

We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \in \{0,1,2,3\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost. (2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\rightarrow$ urban and day $\rightarrow$ night ($\sim 31\%$ each); actor swaps $\sim 10\%$, moderate rain $\sim 7\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance. (7) Scaling traces/views improves robustness ($+11.8$ points from $5$ to $14$ traces), yet targeted exposure to hard conditions can substitute for scale. (8) Using multiple ID environments broadens coverage and strengthens weak cases (urban OOD $60.6\% \rightarrow 70.1\%$) with a small ID drop; single-ID preserves peak performance but in a narrow domain. These results yield actionable design rules for OOD-robust driving policies.</p></details> |  |

However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of ArcFlow both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.

We establish a public, reproducible multi-dataset benchmark for lung nodule detection and nodule-level cancer classification and quantify cross-dataset generalizability. Using the Duke Lung Cancer Screening (DLCS) dataset as a clinically curated development set, we evaluate performance across LUNA16/LIDC-IDRI, NLST-3D, and LUNA25. Detection models trained on DLCS and LUNA16 were evaluated externally on NLST-3D using free-response ROC analysis. For malignancy classification, we compared five strategies: randomly initialized ResNet50, Models Genesis, Med3D, a Foundation Model for Cancer Biomarkers, and a Strategic Warm-Start (ResNet50-SWS) approach pretrained using detection-derived candidate patches stratified by confidence. Performance was summarized using AUC with 95% confidence intervals and DeLong tests. Detection performance varied substantially by training dataset, with DLCS-trained models outperforming LUNA16-trained models on external NLST-3D evaluation (sensitivity at 2 false positives per scan: 0.72 vs. 0.64; p < 0.001). For malignancy classification, ResNet50-SWS achieved AUCs of 0.71 (DLCS), 0.90 (LUNA16), 0.81 (NLST-3D), and 0.80 (LUNA25), consistently matching or exceeding alternative pretraining strategies. These results demonstrate that dataset characteristics strongly influence lung cancer AI performance and highlight the need for transparent, multi-dataset benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 tab...</summary><p>3 tables, 2 supplement tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

While existing authentication mechanisms are available for interaction-rich devices such as smartwatches, enabling on-device authentication (ODA) on interaction-limited wearables including rings, earphones, glasses, and wristbands remains difficult. Moreover, as users increasingly own multiple smart devices, relying on device-specific authentication methods becomes redundant and burdensome. To address these challenges, we present PPGTransID, a ubiquitous and unobtrusive cross-device authentication (CDA) approach that leverages the real-time physiological consistency of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals across the human body. PPGTransID utilizes widely available PPG sensors on wearable devices to capture users' physiological signals and compares them with remote PPG (rPPG) signals extracted from a smartphone camera, where robust face-based authentication is already established. In doing so, PPGTransID securely transfers the reliable authentication status of the smartphone to nearby wearable devices without requiring additional user interaction. An evaluation with 33 participants shows that PPGTransID achieves a balanced accuracy of 95.5 percent and generalizes across multiple wearable form factors. Robustness experiments with 10 participants demonstrate resilience to variations in lighting, camera placement, and user behavior, while a real-time usability study with 14 participants confirms reliable performance with minimal interaction burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 5 tables, submitted to IMWUT 2026</p></details> |

These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1. Remarkably, we maintain the overall annotation cost at just 6-10% of the unlabelled data available to the system. The overall framework of IDALC is shown in Fig. 1</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (October 2025)</p></details> |

This paper explores this question from the angle of discourse processing, an area with rich linguistic insights and computational models for the intentional, attentional, and coherence structure of language. Discourse is highly relevant for open-ended or long-form text generation, yet this connection is under-explored in existing undergraduate curricula. We present a new course, "Computational Discourse and Natural Language Generation". The course is collaboratively designed by a team with complementary expertise and was offered for the first time in Fall 2025 as an upper-level undergraduate course, cross-listed between Linguistics and Computer Science.

Detection models trained on DLCS and LUNA16 were evaluated externally on NLST-3D using free-response ROC analysis. For malignancy classification, we compared five strategies: randomly initialized ResNet50, Models Genesis, Med3D, a Foundation Model for Cancer Biomarkers, and a Strategic Warm-Start (ResNet50-SWS) approach pretrained using detection-derived candidate patches stratified by confidence. Performance was summarized using AUC with 95% confidence intervals and DeLong tests. Detection performance varied substantially by training dataset, with DLCS-trained models outperforming LUNA16-trained models on external NLST-3D evaluation (sensitivity at 2 false positives per scan: 0.72 vs. 0.64; p < 0.001). For malignancy classification, ResNet50-SWS achieved AUCs of 0.71 (DLCS), 0.90 (LUNA16), 0.81 (NLST-3D), and 0.80 (LUNA25), consistently matching or exceeding alternative pretraining strategies. These results demonstrate that dataset characteristics strongly influence lung cancer AI performance and highlight the need for transparent, multi-dataset benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 tab...</summary><p>3 tables, 2 supplement tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

While existing authentication mechanisms are available for interaction-rich devices such as smartwatches, enabling on-device authentication (ODA) on interaction-limited wearables including rings, earphones, glasses, and wristbands remains difficult. Moreover, as users increasingly own multiple smart devices, relying on device-specific authentication methods becomes redundant and burdensome. To address these challenges, we present PPGTransID, a ubiquitous and unobtrusive cross-device authentication (CDA) approach that leverages the real-time physiological consistency of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals across the human body. PPGTransID utilizes widely available PPG sensors on wearable devices to capture users' physiological signals and compares them with remote PPG (rPPG) signals extracted from a smartphone camera, where robust face-based authentication is already established. In doing so, PPGTransID securely transfers the reliable authentication status of the smartphone to nearby wearable devices without requiring additional user interaction. An evaluation with 33 participants shows that PPGTransID achieves a balanced accuracy of 95.5 percent and generalizes across multiple wearable form factors. Robustness experiments with 10 participants demonstrate resilience to variations in lighting, camera placement, and user behavior, while a real-time usability study with 14 participants confirms reliable performance with minimal interaction burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 5 tables, submitted to IMWUT 2026</p></details> |

These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1. Remarkably, we maintain the overall annotation cost at just 6-10% of the unlabelled data available to the system. The overall framework of IDALC is shown in Fig. 1</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (October 2025)</p></details> |

Benchmarking and Intervention-Based Auditing of LLM-Based Scholar Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08873v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for academic expert recommendation. Existing audits typically evaluate model outputs in isolation, largely ignoring end-user inference-time interventions. As a result, it remains unclear whether failures such as refusals, hallucinations, and uneven coverage stem from model choice or deployment decisions. We introduce LLMScholarBench, a benchmark for auditing LLM-based scholar recommendation that jointly evaluates model infrastructure and end-user interventions across multiple tasks. LLMScholarBench measures both technical quality and social representation using nine metrics. We instantiate the benchmark in physics expert recommendation and audit 22 LLMs under temperature variation, representation-constrained prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via web search. Our results show that end-user interventions do not yield uniform improvements but instead redistribute error across dimensions. Higher temperature degrades validity, consistency, and factuality. Representation-constrained prompting improves diversity at the expense of factuality, while RAG primarily improves technical quality while reducing diversity and parity. Overall, end-user interventions reshape trade-offs rather than providing a general fix. We release code and data that can be adapted to other disciplines by replacing domain-specific ground truth and metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages: 8 pages in main (5 figures, 1 table), 20 pages in appendix (18 figures, 2 tables). under-review</p></details> |

This report details the design, implementation and evaluation of a Layer-2 scaling solution for Hyperledger Fabric using Zero Knowledge Rollups (ZK Rollups). The proposed architecture introduces an off chain sequencer that accepts transactions immediately and sends them for batching into a Merkle tree based rollup, using ZK proofs to attest to the correctness and verifiability of the entire batch. The design aims to decouple transaction ingestion from actual on chain settlements to address Fabric scalability limitations and increase throughput under high load conditions. The baseline architecture in Hyperledger Fabric constrains transaction requests due to endorsement, ordering and validation phases, leading to a throughput of 5 to 7 TPS with an average latency of 4 seconds. Our Layer-2 solution achieves an ingestion throughput of 70 to 100 TPS, leading to an increase of nearly ten times due to the sequencer immediate acceptance of each transaction and reducing client perceived latency by nearly eighty percent to 700 to 1000 milliseconds. This work demonstrates that integrating ZK Rollups in Hyperledger Fabric enhances scalability while not compromising the security guarantees of a permissioned blockchain network.</p></details> |  |

We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \in \{0,1,2,3\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost. (2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\rightarrow$ urban and day $\rightarrow$ night ($\sim 31\%$ each); actor swaps $\sim 10\%$, moderate rain $\sim 7\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance. (7) Scaling traces/views improves robustness ($+11.8$ points from $5$ to $14$ traces), yet targeted exposure to hard conditions can substitute for scale. (8) Using multiple ID environments broadens coverage and strengthens weak cases (urban OOD $60.6\% \rightarrow 70.1\%$) with a small ID drop; single-ID preserves peak performance but in a narrow domain. These results yield actionable design rules for OOD-robust driving policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArcFlow: Unleashing 2-Step Text-to-Image Generation via High-Precision Non-Linear Flow Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09014v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generation quality, but they suffer from significant inference cost due to their reliance on multiple sequential denoising steps, motivating recent efforts to distill this inference process into a few-step regime. However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of ArcFlow both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEBench: Benchmarking Image Generation Models as GUI Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09007v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled the prediction of future Graphical User Interface (GUI) states based on user instructions. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments. The code is available at: https://github.com/stepfun-ai/GEBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
