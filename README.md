| **[Representation Learning, Large-Scale 3D Molecular Pretraining, Molecular Property](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10489v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular pretrained representations (MPR) has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing the challenge of limited supervised data in applications such as drug discovery and material design. While early MPR methods relied on 1D sequences and 2D graphs, recent advancements have incorporated 3D conformational information to capture rich atomic interactions. However, these prior models treat molecules merely as discrete atom sets, overlooking the space surrounding them. We argue from a physical perspective that only modeling these discrete points is insufficient. We first present a simple yet insightful observation: naively adding randomly sampled virtual points beyond atoms can surprisingly enhance MPR performance. In light of this, we propose a principled framework that incorporates the entire 3D space spanned by molecules. We implement the framework via a novel Transformer-based architecture, dubbed SpaceFormer, with three key components: (1) grid-based space discretization; (2) grid sampling/merging; and (3) efficient 3D positional encoding. Extensive experiments show that SpaceFormer significantly outperforms previous 3D MPR models across various downstream tasks with limited data, validating the benefit of leveraging the additional 3D space beyond atoms in MPR models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProtTeX: Structure-In-Context Reasoning and Editing of Proteins with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08179v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have made remarkable progress in the field of molecular science, particularly in understanding and generating functional small molecules. This success is largely attributed to the effectiveness of molecular tokenization strategies. In protein science, the amino acid sequence serves as the sole tokenizer for LLMs. However, many fundamental challenges in protein science are inherently structure-dependent. The absence of structure-aware tokens significantly limits the capabilities of LLMs for comprehensive biomolecular comprehension and multimodal generation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, ProtTeX, which tokenizes the protein sequences, structures, and textual information into a unified discrete space. This innovative approach enables joint training of the LLM exclusively through the Next-Token Prediction paradigm, facilitating multimodal protein reasoning and generation. ProtTeX enables general LLMs to perceive and process protein structures through sequential text input, leverage structural information as intermediate reasoning components, and generate or manipulate structures via sequential text output. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in protein function prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art domain expert model with a twofold increase in accuracy. Our framework enables high-quality conformational generation and customizable protein design. For the first time, we demonstrate that by adopting the standard training and inference pipelines from the LLM domain, ProtTeX empowers decoder-only LLMs to effectively address diverse spectrum of protein-related tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Evaluation of a Multi-Molecule Molecular Communication Testbed Based on Spectral Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10280v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel flow-based molecular communication (MC) testbed using spectral sensing and ink intensity estimation to enable real-time multi-molecule (MUMO) transmission. MUMO communication opens up crucial opportunities for increased throughput as well as implementing more complex coding, modulation, and resource allocation strategies for MC testbeds. An estimator using non-invasive spectral sensing at the receiver is proposed based on a simple absorption model. We conduct in-depth channel impulse response (CIR) measurements and a preliminary communication performance evaluation. Additionally, a simple analytical model is used to check the consistency of the CIRs. The results indicate that by utilizing MUMO transmission, on-off-keying, and a simple difference detector, the testbed can achieve up to 3 bits per second for near-error-free communication, which is on par with comparable testbeds that utilize more sophisticated coding or detection methods. Our platform lays the ground for implementing MUMO communication and evaluating various physical layer and networking techniques based on multiple molecule types in future MC testbeds in real time.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SOLA-GCL: Subgraph-Oriented Learnable Augmentation Method for Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10100v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful technique for learning graph representations that are robust and discriminative. However, traditional approaches often neglect the critical role of subgraph structures, particularly the intra-subgraph characteristics and inter-subgraph relationships, which are crucial for generating informative and diverse contrastive pairs. These subgraph features are crucial as they vary significantly across different graph types, such as social networks where they represent communities, and biochemical networks where they symbolize molecular interactions. To address this issue, our work proposes a novel subgraph-oriented learnable augmentation method for graph contrastive learning, termed SOLA-GCL, that centers around subgraphs, taking full advantage of the subgraph information for data augmentation. Specifically, SOLA-GCL initially partitions a graph into multiple densely connected subgraphs based on their intrinsic properties. To preserve and enhance the unique characteristics inherent to subgraphs, a graph view generator optimizes augmentation strategies for each subgraph, thereby generating tailored views for graph contrastive learning. This generator uses a combination of intra-subgraph and inter-subgraph augmentation strategies, including node dropping, feature masking, intra-edge perturbation, inter-edge perturbation, and subgraph swapping. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various graph learning applications, ranging from social networks to molecules, under semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer learning settings to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art in GCL.</p></details> |  |

| **[GENEOnet: Statistical analysis supporting explainability and trustworthiness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09199v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as mathematical tools for constructing networks for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Recent findings suggest that such models can be inserted within the domain of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) due to their inherent interpretability. In this study, we aim to verify this claim with respect to GENEOnet, a GENEO network developed for an application in computational biochemistry by employing various statistical analyses and experiments. Such experiments first allow us to perform a sensitivity analysis on GENEOnet's parameters to test their significance. Subsequently, we show that GENEOnet exhibits a significantly higher proportion of equivariance compared to other methods. Lastly, we demonstrate that GENEOnet is on average robust to perturbations arising from molecular dynamics. These results collectively serve as proof of the explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness of GENEOnet and confirm the beneficial use of GENEOs in the context of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal Foundation Models for Computational Pathology: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09091v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in computational pathology (CPath), enabling scalable and generalizable analysis of histopathological images. While early developments centered on uni-modal models trained solely on visual data, recent advances have highlighted the promise of multi-modal foundation models that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as textual reports, structured domain knowledge, and molecular profiles. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of multi-modal foundation models in CPath, with a particular focus on models built upon hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) and tile-level representations. We categorize 32 state-of-the-art multi-modal foundation models into three major paradigms: vision-language, vision-knowledge graph, and vision-gene expression. We further divide vision-language models into non-LLM-based and LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we analyze 28 available multi-modal datasets tailored for pathology, grouped into image-text pairs, instruction datasets, and image-other modality pairs. Our survey also presents a taxonomy of downstream tasks, highlights training and evaluation strategies, and identifies key challenges and future directions. We aim for this survey to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of pathology and AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[FOSS solution for Molecular Dynamics Simulation Automation and Collaboration with MDSGAT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05113v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The process of setting up and successfully running Molecular Dynamics Simulations (MDS) is outlined to be incredibly labour and computationally expensive with a very high barrier to entry for newcomers wishing to utilise the benefits and insights of MDS. Here, presented, is a unique Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) solution that aims to not only reduce the barrier of entry for new Molecular Dynamics (MD) users, but also significantly reduce the setup time and hardware utilisation overhead for even highly experienced MD researchers. This is accomplished through the creation of the Molecular Dynamics Simulation Generator and Analysis Tool (MDSGAT) which currently serves as a viable alternative to other restrictive or privatised MDS Graphical solutions with a unique design that allows for seamless collaboration and distribution of exact MD simulation setups and initialisation parameters through a single setup file. This solution is designed from the start with a modular mindset allowing for additional software expansion to incorporate numerous extra MDS packages and analysis methods over time</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Mixture-of-Experts: Adaptive Skill-based Routing for Heterogeneous Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05641v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting experts at the task level is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that Symbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally.

| **[evoBPE: Evolutionary Protein Sequence Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08838v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in computational biology have drawn compelling parallels between protein sequences and linguistic structures, highlighting the need for sophisticated tokenization methods that capture the intricate evolutionary dynamics of protein sequences. Current subword tokenization techniques, primarily developed for natural language processing, often fail to represent protein sequences' complex structural and functional properties adequately. This study introduces evoBPE, a novel tokenization approach that integrates evolutionary mutation patterns into sequence segmentation, addressing critical limitations in existing methods. By leveraging established substitution matrices, evoBPE transcends traditional frequency-based tokenization strategies. The method generates candidate token pairs through biologically informed mutations, evaluating them based on pairwise alignment scores and frequency thresholds. Extensive experiments on human protein sequences show that evoBPE performs better across multiple dimensions. Domain conservation analysis reveals that evoBPE consistently outperforms standard Byte-Pair Encoding, particularly as vocabulary size increases. Furthermore, embedding similarity analysis using ESM-2 suggests that mutation-based token replacements preserve biological sequence properties more effectively than arbitrary substitutions. The research contributes to protein sequence representation by introducing a mutation-aware tokenization method that better captures evolutionary nuances. By bridging computational linguistics and molecular biology, evoBPE opens new possibilities for machine learning applications in protein function prediction, structural modeling, and evolutionary analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Understanding and Mitigating Distribution Shifts For Machine Learning Force Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08674v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are a promising alternative to expensive ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations. Given the diversity of chemical spaces that are of interest and the cost of generating new data, it is important to understand how MLFFs generalize beyond their training distributions. In order to characterize and better understand distribution shifts in MLFFs, we conduct diagnostic experiments on chemical datasets, revealing common shifts that pose significant challenges, even for large foundation models trained on extensive data. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that current supervised training methods inadequately regularize MLFFs, resulting in overfitting and learning poor representations of out-of-distribution systems. We then propose two new methods as initial steps for mitigating distribution shifts for MLFFs. Our methods focus on test-time refinement strategies that incur minimal computational cost and do not use expensive ab initio reference labels. The first strategy, based on spectral graph theory, modifies the edges of test graphs to align with graph structures seen during training. Our second strategy improves representations for out-of-distribution systems at test-time by taking gradient steps using an auxiliary objective, such as a cheap physical prior. Our test-time refinement strategies significantly reduce errors on out-of-distribution systems, suggesting that MLFFs are capable of and can move towards modeling diverse chemical spaces, but are not being effectively trained to do so. Our experiments establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the generalization capabilities of the next generation of MLFFs. Our code is available at https://tkreiman.github.io/projects/mlff_distribution_shifts/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chemistry-Inspired Diffusion with Non-Differentiable Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06502v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in the conditional generation of novel molecules. These models can be guided in two ways: (i) explicitly, through additional features representing the condition, or (ii) implicitly, using a property predictor. However, training property predictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled data and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a novel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled datasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a non-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of relying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form of estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a conditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this results in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular structures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly reduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used for stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit guidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular properties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular optimization tasks beyond stability optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[To Use or Not to Use a Universal Force Field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08207v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing scientific research, particularly in computational materials science, by enabling more accurate and efficient simulations. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as powerful tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, potentially offering quantum-mechanical accuracy with the efficiency of classical MD. This Perspective evaluates the viability of universal MLFFs for simulating complex materials systems from the standpoint of a potential practitioner. Using the temperature-driven ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition of PbTiO$_3$ as a benchmark, we assess leading universal force fields, including CHGNet, MACE, M3GNet, and GPTFF, alongside specialized models like UniPero. While universal MLFFs trained on PBE-derived datasets perform well in predicting equilibrium properties, they largely fail to capture realistic finite-temperature phase transitions under constant-pressure MD, often exhibiting unphysical instabilities. These shortcomings stem from inherited biases in exchange-correlation functionals and limited generalization to anharmonic interactions governing dynamic behavior. However, fine-tuning universal models or employing system-specific MLFFs like UniPero successfully restores predictive accuracy. We advocates for hybrid approaches combining universal pretraining with targeted optimization, improved error quantification frameworks, and community-driven benchmarks to advance MLFFs as robust tools for computational materials discovery.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Concept-Driven Deep Learning for Enhanced Protein-Specific Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08160v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, deep learning techniques have made significant strides in molecular generation for specific targets, driving advancements in drug discovery. However, existing molecular generation methods present significant limitations: those operating at the atomic level often lack synthetic feasibility, drug-likeness, and interpretability, while fragment-based approaches frequently overlook comprehensive factors that influence protein-molecule interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel fragment-based molecular generation framework tailored for specific proteins. Our method begins by constructing a protein subpocket and molecular arm concept-based neural network, which systematically integrates interaction force information and geometric complementarity to sample molecular arms for specific protein subpockets. Subsequently, we introduce a diffusion model to generate molecular backbones that connect these arms, ensuring structural integrity and chemical diversity. Our approach significantly improves synthetic feasibility and binding affinity, with a 4% increase in drug-likeness and a 6% improvement in synthetic feasibility. Furthermore, by integrating explicit interaction data through a concept-based model, our framework enhances interpretability, offering valuable insights into the molecular design process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Masked Position Prediction for Efficient Molecular Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08209v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown considerable promise in computational chemistry. However, the limited availability of molecular data raises concerns regarding GNNs' ability to effectively capture the fundamental principles of physics and chemistry, which constrains their generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised approach termed Equivariant Masked Position Prediction (EMPP), grounded in intramolecular potential and force theory. Unlike conventional attribute masking techniques, EMPP formulates a nuanced position prediction task that is more well-defined and enhances the learning of quantum mechanical features. EMPP also bypasses the approximation of the Gaussian mixture distribution commonly used in denoising methods, allowing for more accurate acquisition of physical properties. Experimental results indicate that EMPP significantly enhances performance of advanced molecular architectures, surpassing state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches. Our code is released in https://github.com/ajy112/EMPP</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Brain Tumor Classification on MRI in Light of Molecular Markers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19583v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In research findings, co-deletion of the 1p/19q gene is associated with clinical outcomes in low-grade gliomas. The ability to predict 1p19q status is critical for treatment planning and patient follow-up. This study aims to utilize a specially MRI-based convolutional neural network for brain cancer detection. Although public networks such as RestNet and AlexNet can effectively diagnose brain cancers using transfer learning, the model includes quite a few weights that have nothing to do with medical images. As a result, the diagnostic results are unreliable by the transfer learning model. To deal with the problem of trustworthiness, we create the model from the ground up, rather than depending on a pre-trained model. To enable flexibility, we combined convolution stacking with a dropout and full connect operation, it improved performance by reducing overfitting. During model training, we also supplement the given dataset and inject Gaussian noise. We use three--fold cross-validation to train the best selection model. Comparing InceptionV3, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 fine-tuned with pre-trained models, our model produces better results. On an validation set of 125 codeletion vs. 31 not codeletion images, the proposed network achieves 96.37\% percent F1-score, 97.46\% percent precision, and 96.34\% percent recall when classifying 1p/19q codeletion and not codeletion images.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICAI'...</summary><p>ICAI'22 - The 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, The 2022 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, & Applied Computing (CSCE'22), Las Vegas, USA.

| **[Q-MARL: A quantum-inspired algorithm using neural message passing for large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07397v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by a graph-based technique for predicting molecular properties in quantum chemistry -- atoms' position within molecules in three-dimensional space -- we present Q-MARL, a completely decentralised learning architecture that supports very large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios without the need for strong assumptions like common rewards or agent order. The key is to treat each agent as relative to its surrounding agents in an environment that is presumed to change dynamically. Hence, in each time step, an agent is the centre of its own neighbourhood and also a neighbour to many other agents. Each role is formulated as a sub-graph, and each sub-graph is used as a training sample. A message-passing neural network supports full-scale vertex and edge interaction within a local neighbourhood, while a parameter governing the depth of the sub-graphs eases the training burden. During testing, an agent's actions are locally ensembled across all the sub-graphs that contain it, resulting in robust decisions. Where other approaches struggle to manage 50 agents, Q-MARL can easily marshal thousands. A detailed theoretical analysis proves improvement and convergence, and simulations with the typical collaborative and competitive scenarios show dramatically faster training speeds and reduced training losses.</p></details> |  |
| **[AlphaNet: Scaling Up Local Frame-based Atomistic Interatomic Potential](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07155v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present AlphaNet, a local frame-based equivariant model designed to achieve both accurate and efficient simulations for atomistic systems. Recently, machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have gained prominence in molecular dynamics simulations due to their advantageous efficiency-accuracy balance compared to classical force fields and quantum mechanical calculations, alongside their transferability across various systems. Despite the advancements in improving model accuracy, the efficiency and scalability of MLFFs remain significant obstacles in practical applications. AlphaNet enhances computational efficiency and accuracy by leveraging the local geometric structures of atomic environments through the construction of equivariant local frames and learnable frame transitions. We substantiate the efficacy of AlphaNet across diverse datasets, including defected graphene, formate decomposition, zeolites, and surface reactions. AlphaNet consistently surpasses well-established models, such as NequIP and DeepPot, in terms of both energy and force prediction accuracy. Notably, AlphaNet offers one of the best trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy among existing models. Moreover, AlphaNet exhibits scalability across a broad spectrum of system and dataset sizes, affirming its versatility.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Bridging Molecular Graphs and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03135v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional generalization capabilities, their ability to process graph data, such as molecular structures, remains limited. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Graph2Token, an efficient solution that aligns graph tokens to LLM tokens. The key idea is to represent a graph token with the LLM token vocabulary, without fine-tuning the LLM backbone. To achieve this goal, we first construct a molecule-text paired dataset from multisources, including CHEBI and HMDB, to train a graph structure encoder, which reduces the distance between graphs and texts representations in the feature space. Then, we propose a novel alignment strategy that associates a graph token with LLM tokens. To further unleash the potential of LLMs, we collect molecular IUPAC name identifiers, which are incorporated into the LLM prompts. By aligning molecular graphs as special tokens, we can activate LLM generalization ability to molecular few-shot learning. Extensive experiments on molecular classification and regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Graph2Token.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 camera ready version</p></details> |
| **[Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning for Multi-task Molecule Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18084v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in various natural language processing tasks such as question answering and machine translation. However, due to the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of manual annotation for biochemical properties, the performance for molecule generation tasks is still limited, especially for tasks involving multi-properties constraints. In this work, we present a two-step framework PEIT (Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning) to improve LLMs for molecular-related tasks. In the first step, we use textual descriptions, SMILES, and biochemical properties as multimodal inputs to pre-train a model called PEIT-GEN, by aligning multi-modal representations to synthesize instruction data. In the second step, we fine-tune existing open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the resulting PEIT-LLM can handle molecule captioning, text-based molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and our newly proposed multi-constraint molecule generation tasks. Experimental results show that our pre-trained PEIT-GEN outperforms MolT5 and BioT5 in molecule captioning, demonstrating modalities align well between textual descriptions, structures, and biochemical properties. Furthermore, PEIT-LLM shows promising improvements in multi-task molecule generation, proving the scalability of the PEIT framework for various molecular tasks. We release the code, constructed instruction data, and model checkpoints in https://github.com/chenlong164/PEIT.</p></details> | 9 |
| **[Towards a Multimodal MRI-Based Foundation Model for Multi-Level Feature Exploration in Segmentation, Molecular Subtyping, and Grading of Glioma](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06828v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, noninvasive glioma characterization is crucial for effective clinical management. Traditional methods, dependent on invasive tissue sampling, often fail to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the tumor. While deep learning has improved segmentation and molecular profiling, few approaches simultaneously integrate tumor morphology and molecular features. Foundation deep learning models, which learn robust, task-agnostic representations from large-scale datasets, hold great promise but remain underutilized in glioma imaging biomarkers. We propose the Multi-Task SWIN-UNETR (MTS-UNET) model, a novel foundation-based framework built on the BrainSegFounder model, pretrained on large-scale neuroimaging data. MTS-UNET simultaneously performs glioma segmentation, histological grading, and molecular subtyping (IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion). It incorporates two key modules: Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding (TAFE) for multi-scale, tumor-focused feature extraction and Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a diverse, multi-center cohort of 2,249 glioma patients from seven public datasets. MTS-UNET achieved a mean Dice score of 84% for segmentation, along with AUCs of 90.58% for IDH mutation, 69.22% for 1p/19q co-deletion prediction, and 87.54% for grading, significantly outperforming baseline models (p<=0.05). Ablation studies validated the essential contributions of the TAFE and CMD modules and demonstrated the robustness of the framework. The foundation-based MTS-UNET model effectively integrates tumor segmentation with multi-level classification, exhibiting strong generalizability across diverse MRI datasets. This framework shows significant potential for advancing noninvasive, personalized glioma management by improving predictive accuracy and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[SupReMix: Supervised Contrastive Learning for Medical Imaging Regression with Mixup](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16633v3)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical image analysis, regression plays a critical role in computer-aided diagnosis. It enables quantitative measurements such as age prediction from structural imaging, cardiac function quantification, and molecular measurement from PET scans. While deep learning has shown promise for these tasks, most approaches focus solely on optimizing regression loss or model architecture, neglecting the quality of learned feature representations which are crucial for robust clinical predictions. Directly applying representation learning techniques designed for classification to regression often results in fragmented representations in the latent space, yielding sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we argue that the potential of contrastive learning for medical image regression has been overshadowed due to the neglect of two crucial aspects: ordinality-awareness and hardness. To address these challenges, we propose Supervised Contrastive Learning for Medical Imaging Regression with Mixup (SupReMix). It takes anchor-inclusive mixtures (mixup of the anchor and a distinct negative sample) as hard negative pairs and anchor-exclusive mixtures (mixup of two distinct negative samples) as hard positive pairs at the embedding level. This strategy formulates harder contrastive pairs by integrating richer ordinal information.

With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there is growing interest in leveraging AI-based methods to accelerate yield predictions without conducting in vitro experiments. We present log-RRIM, an innovative graph transformer-based framework designed for predicting chemical reaction yields. A key feature of log-RRIM is its integration of a cross-attention mechanism that focuses on the interplay between reagents and reaction centers. This design reflects a fundamental principle in chemical reactions: the crucial role of reagents in influencing bond-breaking and formation processes, which ultimately affect reaction yields. log-RRIM also implements a local-to-global reaction representation learning strategy. This approach initially captures detailed molecule-level information and then models and aggregates intermolecular interactions. Through this hierarchical process, log-RRIM effectively captures how different molecular fragments contribute to and influence the overall reaction yield, regardless of their size variations. log-RRIM shows superior performance in our experiments, especially for medium to high-yielding reactions, proving its reliability as a predictor. The framework's sophisticated modeling of reactant-reagent interactions and precise capture of molecular fragment contributions make it a valuable tool for reaction planning and optimization in chemical synthesis. The data and codes of log-RRIM are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/Yield_log_RRIM.</p></details> | 45 pages, 8 figures |

However, current GCL models face challenges with computational demands and limited feature utilization, often relying only on basic graph properties like node degrees and edge attributes. This constrains their capacity to fully capture the complex topological characteristics of real-world phenomena represented by graphs. To address these limitations, we propose Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning (TensorMV-GCL), a novel framework that integrates extended persistent homology (EPH) with GCL representations and facilitates multi-scale feature extraction. Our approach uniquely employs tensor aggregation and compression to fuse information from graph and topological features obtained from multiple augmented views of the same graph. By incorporating tensor concatenation and contraction modules, we reduce computational overhead by separating feature tensor aggregation and transformation. Furthermore, we enhance the quality of learned topological features and model robustness through noise-injected EPH. Experiments on molecular, bioinformatic, and social network datasets demonstrate TensorMV-GCL's superiority, outperforming 15 state-of-the-art methods in graph classification tasks across 9 out of 11 benchmarks while achieving comparable results on the remaining two. The code for this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/CS-SAIL/Tensor-MV-GCL.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pretraining Generative Flow Networks with Inexpensive Rewards for Molecular Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06337v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have recently emerged as a suitable framework for generating diverse and high-quality molecular structures by learning from rewards treated as unnormalized distributions. Previous works in this framework often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on a subset of ZINC dataset, and by employing robust evaluation metrics we show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods for a wide range of drug design tasks.</p></details> |  |

A significant portion of key information is embedded in molecular structure figures, complicating large-scale literature searches and limiting the application of large language models in fields such as biology, chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. The automatic extraction of precise chemical structures is of critical importance. However, the presence of numerous Markush structures in real-world documents, along with variations in molecular image quality, drawing styles, and noise, significantly limits the performance of existing optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) methods. We present MolParser, a novel end-to-end OCSR method that efficiently and accurately recognizes chemical structures from real-world documents, including difficult Markush structure. We use a extended SMILES encoding rule to annotate our training dataset. Under this rule, we build MolParser-7M, the largest annotated molecular image dataset to our knowledge. While utilizing a large amount of synthetic data, we employed active learning methods to incorporate substantial in-the-wild data, specifically samples cropped from real patents and scientific literature, into the training process. We trained an end-to-end molecular image captioning model, MolParser, using a curriculum learning approach. MolParser significantly outperforms classical and learning-based methods across most scenarios, with potential for broader downstream applications. The dataset is publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning-Order Autoregressive Models with Application to Molecular Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05979v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models (ARMs) have become the workhorse for sequence generation tasks, since many problems can be modeled as next-token prediction. While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an \emph{order-policy}, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the exact log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation. On the challenging domain of molecular graph generation, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k benchmarks, evaluated using the Fr\'{e}chet ChemNet Distance (FCD).</p></details> |  |

A flow on $\mathcal{N}$ is a function $x: A(D) \to R_+$ such that $x(a) \leq u(a)$ for all $a \in A(D)$, and it is said to be $k$-splittable if it can be decomposed into up to $k$ paths. We say that a flow is $\lambda$-uniform if its value on each arc of the network with positive flow value is exactly $\lambda$, for some $\lambda \in R_+^*$. Arc-coloured networks are used to model qualitative differences among different regions through which the flow will be sent. They have applications in several areas such as communication networks, multimodal transportation, molecular biology, packing etc. We consider the problem of decomposing a flow over an arc-coloured network with minimum cost, that is, with minimum sum of the cost of its paths, where the cost of each path is given by its number of colours. We show that this problem is NP-Hard for general flows. When we restrict the problem to $\lambda$-uniform flows, we show that it can be solved in polynomial time for networks with at most two colours, and it is NP-Hard for general networks with three colours and for acyclic networks with at least five colours.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Efficient Evolutionary Search Over Chemical Space with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16976v3)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular discovery, when formulated as an optimization problem, presents significant computational challenges because optimization objectives can be non-differentiable. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), often used to optimize black-box objectives in molecular discovery, traverse chemical space by performing random mutations and crossovers, leading to a large number of expensive objective evaluations. In this work, we ameliorate this shortcoming by incorporating chemistry-aware Large Language Models (LLMs) into EAs. Namely, we redesign crossover and mutation operations in EAs using LLMs trained on large corpora of chemical information. We perform extensive empirical studies on both commercial and open-source models on multiple tasks involving property optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design, demonstrating that the joint usage of LLMs with EAs yields superior performance over all baseline models across single- and multi-objective settings. We demonstrate that our algorithm improves both the quality of the final solution and convergence speed, thereby reducing the number of required objective evaluations.

Despite the relevance of these applications, existing solutions are unsatisfactory as they require severely restricted model architectures or rely on energy-based training, which is prone to instability. We introduce TRADE, which overcomes these limitations by formulating the learning process as a boundary value problem. By initially training the model for a specific condition using either i.i.d.~samples or backward KL training, we establish a boundary distribution. We then propagate this information across other conditions using the gradient of the unnormalized density with respect to the external parameter. This formulation, akin to the principles of physics-informed neural networks, allows us to efficiently learn parameter-dependent distributions without restrictive assumptions. Experimentally, we demonstrate that TRADE achieves excellent results in a wide range of applications, ranging from Bayesian inference and molecular simulations to physical lattice models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Poster at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

In our study, we reveal a critical yet underexplored consequence of integrating attention into edge-featured GNNs: the emergence of Massive Activations (MAs) within attention layers. By developing a novel method for detecting MAs on edge features, we show that these extreme activations are not only activation anomalies but encode domain-relevant signals. Our post-hoc interpretability analysis demonstrates that, in molecular graphs, MAs aggregate predominantly on common bond types (e.g., single and double bonds) while sparing more informative ones (e.g., triple bonds). Furthermore, our ablation studies confirm that MAs can serve as natural attribution indicators, reallocating to less informative edges. Our study assesses various edge-featured attention-based GNN models using benchmark datasets, including ZINC, TOX21, and PROTEINS. Key contributions include (1) establishing the direct link between attention mechanisms and MAs generation in edge-featured GNNs, (2) developing a robust definition and detection method for MAs enabling reliable post-hoc interpretability. Overall, our study reveals the complex interplay between attention mechanisms, edge-featured GNNs model, and MAs emergence, providing crucial insights for relating GNNs internals to domain knowledge.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on trial-and-error, while recent deep learning approaches have accelerated molecular generation. However, existing models struggle with generating molecules based on specific textual descriptions. We introduce Mol-CADiff, a novel diffusion-based framework that uses causal attention mechanisms for text-conditional molecular generation. Our approach explicitly models the causal relationship between textual prompts and molecular structures, overcoming key limitations in existing methods. We enhance dependency modeling both within and across modalities, enabling precise control over the generation process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Mol-CADiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating diverse, novel, and chemically valid molecules, with better alignment to specified properties, enabling more intuitive language-driven molecular design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint graphical model estimation using Stein-type shrinkage for fast large scale network inference in scRNAseq data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05448v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical modeling is a widely used tool for analyzing conditional dependencies between variables and traditional methods may struggle to capture shared and distinct structures in multi-group or multi-condition settings. Joint graphical modeling (JGM) extends this framework by simultaneously estimating network structures across multiple related datasets, allowing for a deeper understanding of commonalities and differences. This capability is particularly valuable in fields such as genomics and neuroscience, where identifying variations in network topology can provide critical biological insights. Existing JGM methodologies largely fall into two categories: regularization-based approaches, which introduce additional penalties to enforce structured sparsity, and Bayesian frameworks, which incorporate prior knowledge to improve network inference. In this study, we explore an alternative method based on two-target linear covariance matrix shrinkage. Formula for optimal shrinkage intensities is proposed which leads to the development of JointStein framework. Performance of JointStein framework is proposed through simulation benchmarking which demonstrates its effectiveness for large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Finally, we apply our approach to glioblastoma scRNA-seq data, uncovering dynamic shifts in T cell network structures across disease progression stages. The result highlights potential of JointStein framework in extracting biologically meaningful insights from high-dimensional data.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeFoG: Discrete Flow Matching for Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04263v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph generative models are essential across diverse scientific domains by capturing complex distributions over relational data. Among them, graph diffusion models achieve superior performance but face inefficient sampling and limited flexibility due to the tight coupling between training and sampling stages. We introduce DeFoG, a novel graph generative framework that disentangles sampling from training, enabling a broader design space for more effective and efficient model optimization. DeFoG employs a discrete flow-matching formulation that respects the inherent symmetries of graphs. We theoretically ground this disentangled formulation by explicitly relating the training loss to the sampling algorithm and showing that DeFoG faithfully replicates the ground truth graph distribution. Building on these foundations, we thoroughly investigate DeFoG's design space and propose novel sampling methods that significantly enhance performance and reduce the required number of refinement steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across synthetic, molecular, and digital pathology datasets, covering both unconditional and conditional generation settings. It also outperforms most diffusion-based models with just 5-10% of their sampling steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformers for molecular property prediction: Domain adaptation efficiently improves performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03360v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the current transformer-based chemical language models are pre-trained on millions to billions of molecules. However, the improvement from such scaling in dataset size is not confidently linked to improved molecular property prediction. The aim of this study is to investigate and overcome some of the limitations of transformer models in predicting molecular properties. Specifically, we examine the impact of pre-training dataset size and diversity on the performance of transformer models and investigate the use of domain adaptation as a technique for improving model performance. First, our findings indicate that increasing pretraining dataset size beyond 400K molecules from the GuacaMol dataset does not result in a significant improvement on four ADME endpoints, namely, solubility, permeability, microsomal stability, and plasma protein binding. Second, our results demonstrate that using domain adaptation by further training the transformer model on a small set of domain-relevant molecules, i.e., a few hundred to a few thousand, using multi-task regression of physicochemical properties was sufficient to significantly improve performance for three out of the four investigated ADME endpoints (P-value < 0.001). Finally, we observe that a model pre-trained on 400K molecules and domain adopted on a few hundred/thousand molecules performs similarly (P-value > 0.05) to more complicated transformer models like MolBERT(pre-trained on 1.3M molecules) and MolFormer (pre-trained on 100M molecules). A comparison to a random forest model trained on basic physicochemical properties showed similar performance to the examined transformer models. We believe that current transformer models can be improved through further systematic analysis of pre-training and downstream data, pre-training objectives, and scaling laws, ultimately leading to better and more helpful models.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphT5: Unified Molecular Graph-Language Modeling via Multi-Modal Cross-Token Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07655v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular language modeling tasks such as molecule captioning have been recognized for their potential to further understand molecular properties that can aid drug discovery or material synthesis based on chemical reactions. Unlike the common use of molecule graphs in predicting molecular properties, most methods in molecular language modeling rely heavily on SMILES sequences. This preference is because the task involves generating a sequence of multiple tokens using transformer-based models. Therefore, a main challenge is determining how to integrate graph data, which contains structural and spatial information about molecules, with text data. In addition, simply using both 1D SMILES text and 2D graph as inputs without addressing how they align and represent the molecule structure in different modalities makes it challenging to fully utilize structural knowledge about molecules. To this end, we propose GraphT5, a multi-modal framework that integrates 1D SMILES text and 2D graph representations of molecules for molecular language modeling. Specifically, we introduce a novel cross-token attention module in GraphT5 to bridge the gap arising from the fundamental differences between the two modalities of molecule representations. Cross-token attention exploits implicit information between SMILES and graphs of molecules, resulting from their interactions at a fine-grained token level that benefits molecular language modeling. Extensive experiments including molecule captioning, IUPAC name prediction tasks, and case studies show that our GraphT5 outperforms the latest baseline approaches, which validates the effectiveness of our GraphT5 in sufficiently utilizing 1D SMILES text and 2D graph representations.</p></details> |  |

However, current herb recommendation models inadequately capture the multiscale relations between herbs and clinical symptoms, particularly neglecting latent correlations at the chemical-molecular scale. To address these limitations, we propose the Fusion of Multiscale Correlations of Herbs and Symptoms (FMCHS), an innovative framework that synergistically integrates molecular-scale chemical characteristics of herbs with clinical symptoms. The framework employs multi-relational graph transformer layers to generate enriched embeddings that preserve both structural and semantic features within herbs and symptoms. Through systematic incorporation of herb chemical profiles into node embeddings and implementation of attention-based feature fusion, FMCHS effectively utilizes multiscale correlations. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate FMCHS's superior performance over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline, achieving relative improvements of 8.85% in Precision@5, 12.30% in Recall@5, and 10.86% in F1@5 compared to the SOTA model on benchmark datasets. This work facilitates the practical application of TCM in disease treatment and healthcare.</p></details> |  |

While DNA-based molecular tagging has emerged as a promising anti-counterfeiting strategy, existing methods rely on predefined DNA sequences, making them vulnerable to replication as sequencing and synthesis technologies advance. To address these limitations, we introduce POSERS (Position-Oriented Scattering of Elements among a Randomized Sequence), a steganographic tagging system embedded within DNA sequences. POSERS ensures copy- and forgery-proof authentication by adding restrictions within randomized DNA libraries, enhancing security against counterfeiting attempts. The POSERS design allows the complexity of the libraries to be adjusted based on the customer's needs while ensuring they withstand the ongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies. We mathematically validate its security properties and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness using Next-Generation Sequencing and an authentication test, successfully distinguishing genuine POSERS tags from counterfeit ones. Our results highlight the potential of POSERS as a long-term, adaptable solution for secure product authentication.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generalist Cross-Domain Molecular Learning Framework for Structure-Based Drug Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04362v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structure-based drug discovery (SBDD) is a systematic scientific process that develops new drugs by leveraging the detailed physical structure of the target protein. Recent advancements in pre-trained models for biomolecules have demonstrated remarkable success across various biochemical applications, including drug discovery and protein engineering. However, in most approaches, the pre-trained models primarily focus on the characteristics of either small molecules or proteins, without delving into their binding interactions which are essential cross-domain relationships pivotal to SBDD. To fill this gap, we propose a general-purpose foundation model named BIT (an abbreviation for Biomolecular Interaction Transformer), which is capable of encoding a range of biochemical entities, including small molecules, proteins, and protein-ligand complexes, as well as various data formats, encompassing both 2D and 3D structures. Specifically, we introduce Mixture-of-Domain-Experts (MoDE) to handle the biomolecules from diverse biochemical domains and Mixture-of-Structure-Experts (MoSE) to capture positional dependencies in the molecular structures. The proposed mixture-of-experts approach enables BIT to achieve both deep fusion and domain-specific encoding, effectively capturing fine-grained molecular interactions within protein-ligand complexes. Then, we perform cross-domain pre-training on the shared Transformer backbone via several unified self-supervised denoising tasks. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that BIT achieves exceptional performance in downstream tasks, including binding affinity prediction, structure-based virtual screening, and molecular property prediction.</p></details> |  |

Causal relationships in such networks are mediated by complex and diverse mechanisms, through latent variables, and are often specific to cellular context. It remains challenging to characterise such networks in practice. Here, we present a novel framework to evaluate large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot inference of causal relationships in biology. In particular, we systematically evaluate causal claims obtained from an LLM using real-world interventional data. This is done over one hundred variables and thousands of causal hypotheses. Furthermore, we consider several prompting and retrieval-augmentation strategies, including large, and potentially conflicting, collections of scientific articles. Our results show that with tailored augmentation and prompting, even relatively small LLMs can capture meaningful aspects of causal structure in biological systems. This supports the notion that LLMs could act as orchestration tools in biological discovery, by helping to distil current knowledge in ways amenable to downstream analysis. Our approach to assessing LLMs with respect to experimental data is relevant for a broad range of problems at the intersection of causal learning, LLMs and scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning for Genomics Explorations</p></details> |

Based on computational results, we conclude that binding interactions represent the anticipated exact solution. Additionally, as the size of the examined instance increases, the computational times exhibit a significant escalation.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, most existing models do not account for synthesizability, limiting their practical use in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose RxnFlow, which sequentially assembles molecules using predefined molecular building blocks and chemical reaction templates to constrain the synthetic chemical pathway. We then train on this sequential generating process with the objective of generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to generate both highly rewarded and diverse molecules. To mitigate the large action space of synthetic pathways in GFlowNets, we implement a novel action space subsampling method. This enables RxnFlow to learn generative flows over extensive action spaces comprising combinations of 1.2 million building blocks and 71 reaction templates without significant computational overhead. Additionally, RxnFlow can employ modified or expanded action spaces for generation without retraining, allowing for the introduction of additional objectives or the incorporation of newly discovered building blocks. We experimentally demonstrate that RxnFlow outperforms existing reaction-based and fragment-based models in pocket-specific optimization across various target pockets. Furthermore, RxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossDocked2020 for pocket-conditional generation, with an average Vina score of -8.85 kcal/mol and 34.8% synthesizability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025, 32 pages, 17 figures, code: https://github.com/SeonghwanSeo/RxnFlow</p></details> |

However, the prediction and interpretation of these sequences remain challenging due to the intricate nature of genetic material. Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for biological sequence analysis. Recent developments in genomic language models have underscored the potential of LLMs in deciphering DNA sequences. Nonetheless, existing models often face limitations in robustness and application scope, primarily due to constraints in model structure and training data scale. To address these limitations, we present GENERator, a generative genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 98k base pairs (bp) and 1.2B parameters. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386B bp of eukaryotic DNA, the GENERator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both established and newly proposed benchmarks. The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology, accurately generating protein-coding sequences that translate into proteins structurally analogous to known families. It also shows significant promise in sequence optimization, particularly through the prompt-responsive generation of enhancer sequences with specific activity profiles. These capabilities position the GENERator as a pivotal tool for genomic research and biotechnological advancement, enhancing our ability to interpret and predict complex biological systems and enabling precise genomic interventions.

Here, we leverage machine learning (ML) to predict hydrogen-to-metal (H/M) ratios and solution energy by incorporating thermodynamic parameters and local lattice distortion (LLD) as key features. Our best-performing ML model provides improvements to H/M ratios and solution energies over a broad class of ternary alloys (easily extendable to multi-principal-element alloys), such as Ti-Nb-X (X = Mo, Cr, Hf, Ta, V, Zr) and Co-Ni-X (X = Al, Mg, V). Ti-Nb-Mo alloys reveal compositional effects in H-storage behavior, in particular Ti, Nb, and V enhance H-storage capacity, while Mo reduces H/M and hydrogen weight percent by 40-50%. We attributed to slow hydrogen kinetics in molybdenum rich alloys, which is validated by our pressure-composition isotherm (PCT) experiments on pure Ti and Ti5Mo95 alloys. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular simulations also confirm that Ti and Nb promote H diffusion, whereas Mo hinders it, highlighting the interplay between electronic structure, lattice distortions, and hydrogen uptake. Notably, our Gradient Boosting Regression model identifies LLD as a critical factor in H/M predictions. To aid material selection, we present two periodic tables illustrating elemental effects on (a) H2 wt% and (b) solution energy, derived from ML, and provide a reference for identifying alloying elements that enhance hydrogen solubility and storage.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 12 figures, 87 references</p></details> |

For high-throughput analyses especially, trained surrogate models can help circumvent traditional approaches to conformational analysis that rely on expensive conformer searches and geometry optimizations. Here, we question how the performance of surrogate models for predicting 3D conformer-dependent properties (of a single, active conformer) is affected by the quality of the 3D conformers used as their input. How well do lower-quality conformers inform the prediction of properties of higher-quality conformers? Does the fidelity of geometry optimization matter when encoding random conformers? For models that encode sets of conformers, how does the presence of the active conformer that induces the target property affect model accuracy? How do predictions from a surrogate model compare to estimating the properties from cheap ensembles themselves? We explore these questions in the context of predicting Sterimol parameters of conformer ensembles optimized with density functional theory.

Traditional structure-based drug design (SBDD) approaches typically target binding sites with rigid structures, limiting their practical application in drug development. While molecular dynamics simulation can theoretically capture all the biologically relevant conformations, the transition rate is dictated by the intrinsic energy barrier between them, making the sampling process computationally expensive. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose to use generative modeling for SBDD considering conformational changes of protein pockets. We curate a dataset of apo and multiple holo states of protein-ligand complexes, simulated by molecular dynamics, and propose a full-atom flow model (and a stochastic version), named DynamicFlow, that learns to transform apo pockets and noisy ligands into holo pockets and corresponding 3D ligand molecules. Our method uncovers promising ligand molecules and corresponding holo conformations of pockets. Additionally, the resultant holo-like states provide superior inputs for traditional SBDD approaches, playing a significant role in practical drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[All-atom Diffusion Transformers: Unified generative modelling of molecules and materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03965v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are the standard toolkit for generative modelling of 3D atomic systems. However, for different types of atomic systems - such as molecules and materials - the generative processes are usually highly specific to the target system despite the underlying physics being the same. We introduce the All-atom Diffusion Transformer (ADiT), a unified latent diffusion framework for jointly generating both periodic materials and non-periodic molecular systems using the same model: (1) An autoencoder maps a unified, all-atom representations of molecules and materials to a shared latent embedding space; and (2) A diffusion model is trained to generate new latent embeddings that the autoencoder can decode to sample new molecules or materials. Experiments on QM9 and MP20 datasets demonstrate that jointly trained ADiT generates realistic and valid molecules as well as materials, exceeding state-of-the-art results from molecule and crystal-specific models. ADiT uses standard Transformers for both the autoencoder and diffusion model, resulting in significant speedups during training and inference compared to equivariant diffusion models. Scaling ADiT up to half a billion parameters predictably improves performance, representing a step towards broadly generalizable foundation models for generative chemistry.

| **[The Signed Two-Space Proximity Model for Learning Representations in Protein-Protein Interaction Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03904v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting complex protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for decoding biological processes, from cellular functioning to disease mechanisms. However, experimental methods for determining PPIs are computationally expensive. Thus, attention has been recently drawn to machine learning approaches. Furthermore, insufficient effort has been made toward analyzing signed PPI networks, which capture both activating (positive) and inhibitory (negative) interactions. To accurately represent biological relationships, we present the Signed Two-Space Proximity Model (S2-SPM) for signed PPI networks, which explicitly incorporates both types of interactions, reflecting the complex regulatory mechanisms within biological systems. This is achieved by leveraging two independent latent spaces to differentiate between positive and negative interactions while representing protein similarity through proximity in these spaces. Our approach also enables the identification of archetypes representing extreme protein profiles. S2-SPM's superior performance in predicting the presence and sign of interactions in SPPI networks is demonstrated in link prediction tasks against relevant baseline methods. Additionally, the biological prevalence of the identified archetypes is confirmed by an enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which reveals that distinct biological tasks are associated with archetypal groups formed by both interactions. This study is also validated regarding statistical significance and sensitivity analysis, providing insights into the functional roles of different interaction types. Finally, the robustness and consistency of the extracted archetype structures are confirmed using the Bayesian Normalized Mutual Information (BNMI) metric, proving the model's reliability in capturing meaningful SPPI patterns.</p></details> | Preprint |

This success is largely attributed to the effectiveness of molecular tokenization strategies. In protein science, the amino acid sequence serves as the sole tokenizer for LLMs. However, many fundamental challenges in protein science are inherently structure-dependent. The absence of structure-aware tokens significantly limits the capabilities of LLMs for comprehensive biomolecular comprehension and multimodal generation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, ProtTeX, which tokenizes the protein sequences, structures, and textual information into a unified discrete space. This innovative approach enables joint training of the LLM exclusively through the Next-Token Prediction paradigm, facilitating multimodal protein reasoning and generation. ProtTeX enables general LLMs to perceive and process protein structures through sequential text input, leverage structural information as intermediate reasoning components, and generate or manipulate structures via sequential text output. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in protein function prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art domain expert model with a twofold increase in accuracy. Our framework enables high-quality conformational generation and customizable protein design. For the first time, we demonstrate that by adopting the standard training and inference pipelines from the LLM domain, ProtTeX empowers decoder-only LLMs to effectively address diverse spectrum of protein-related tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |

Here, presented, is a unique Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) solution that aims to not only reduce the barrier of entry for new Molecular Dynamics (MD) users, but also significantly reduce the setup time and hardware utilisation overhead for even highly experienced MD researchers. This is accomplished through the creation of the Molecular Dynamics Simulation Generator and Analysis Tool (MDSGAT) which currently serves as a viable alternative to other restrictive or privatised MDS Graphical solutions with a unique design that allows for seamless collaboration and distribution of exact MD simulation setups and initialisation parameters through a single setup file.

| **[Chemistry-Inspired Diffusion with Non-Differentiable Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06502v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in the conditional generation of novel molecules. These models can be guided in two ways: (i) explicitly, through additional features representing the condition, or (ii) implicitly, using a property predictor. However, training property predictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled data and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a novel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled datasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a non-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of relying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form of estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a conditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this results in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular structures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly reduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used for stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit guidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular properties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular optimization tasks beyond stability optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing molecular generation methods present significant limitations: those operating at the atomic level often lack synthetic feasibility, drug-likeness, and interpretability, while fragment-based approaches frequently overlook comprehensive factors that influence protein-molecule interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel fragment-based molecular generation framework tailored for specific proteins. Our method begins by constructing a protein subpocket and molecular arm concept-based neural network, which systematically integrates interaction force information and geometric complementarity to sample molecular arms for specific protein subpockets. Subsequently, we introduce a diffusion model to generate molecular backbones that connect these arms, ensuring structural integrity and chemical diversity. Our approach significantly improves synthetic feasibility and binding affinity, with a 4% increase in drug-likeness and a 6% improvement in synthetic feasibility. Furthermore, by integrating explicit interaction data through a concept-based model, our framework enhances interpretability, offering valuable insights into the molecular design process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Molecular Graphs and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03135v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional generalization capabilities, their ability to process graph data, such as molecular structures, remains limited. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Graph2Token, an efficient solution that aligns graph tokens to LLM tokens. The key idea is to represent a graph token with the LLM token vocabulary, without fine-tuning the LLM backbone. To achieve this goal, we first construct a molecule-text paired dataset from multisources, including CHEBI and HMDB, to train a graph structure encoder, which reduces the distance between graphs and texts representations in the feature space. Then, we propose a novel alignment strategy that associates a graph token with LLM tokens. To further unleash the potential of LLMs, we collect molecular IUPAC name identifiers, which are incorporated into the LLM prompts. By aligning molecular graphs as special tokens, we can activate LLM generalization ability to molecular few-shot learning. Extensive experiments on molecular classification and regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Graph2Token.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 camera ready version</p></details> |
| **[Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning for Multi-task Molecule Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18084v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in various natural language processing tasks such as question answering and machine translation. However, due to the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of manual annotation for biochemical properties, the performance for molecule generation tasks is still limited, especially for tasks involving multi-properties constraints. In this work, we present a two-step framework PEIT (Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning) to improve LLMs for molecular-related tasks. In the first step, we use textual descriptions, SMILES, and biochemical properties as multimodal inputs to pre-train a model called PEIT-GEN, by aligning multi-modal representations to synthesize instruction data. In the second step, we fine-tune existing open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the resulting PEIT-LLM can handle molecule captioning, text-based molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and our newly proposed multi-constraint molecule generation tasks. Experimental results show that our pre-trained PEIT-GEN outperforms MolT5 and BioT5 in molecule captioning, demonstrating modalities align well between textual descriptions, structures, and biochemical properties. Furthermore, PEIT-LLM shows promising improvements in multi-task molecule generation, proving the scalability of the PEIT framework for various molecular tasks. We release the code, constructed instruction data, and model checkpoints in https://github.com/chenlong164/PEIT.</p></details> | 9 |

Previous works in this framework often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on a subset of ZINC dataset, and by employing robust evaluation metrics we show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods for a wide range of drug design tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning-Order Autoregressive Models with Application to Molecular Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05979v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models (ARMs) have become the workhorse for sequence generation tasks, since many problems can be modeled as next-token prediction. While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an \emph{order-policy}, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the exact log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation. On the challenging domain of molecular graph generation, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k benchmarks, evaluated using the Fr\'{e}chet ChemNet Distance (FCD).</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on trial-and-error, while recent deep learning approaches have accelerated molecular generation. However, existing models struggle with generating molecules based on specific textual descriptions. We introduce Mol-CADiff, a novel diffusion-based framework that uses causal attention mechanisms for text-conditional molecular generation. Our approach explicitly models the causal relationship between textual prompts and molecular structures, overcoming key limitations in existing methods. We enhance dependency modeling both within and across modalities, enabling precise control over the generation process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Mol-CADiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating diverse, novel, and chemically valid molecules, with better alignment to specified properties, enabling more intuitive language-driven molecular design.</p></details> |  |
| **[GENERator: A Long-Context Generative Genomic Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07272v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have significantly improved our ability to decode genomic sequences. However, the prediction and interpretation of these sequences remain challenging due to the intricate nature of genetic material. Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for biological sequence analysis. Recent developments in genomic language models have underscored the potential of LLMs in deciphering DNA sequences. Nonetheless, existing models often face limitations in robustness and application scope, primarily due to constraints in model structure and training data scale. To address these limitations, we present GENERator, a generative genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 98k base pairs (bp) and 1.2B parameters. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386B bp of eukaryotic DNA, the GENERator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both established and newly proposed benchmarks. The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology, accurately generating protein-coding sequences that translate into proteins structurally analogous to known families. It also shows significant promise in sequence optimization, particularly through the prompt-responsive generation of enhancer sequences with specific activity profiles. These capabilities position the GENERator as a pivotal tool for genomic research and biotechnological advancement, enhancing our ability to interpret and predict complex biological systems and enabling precise genomic interventions.

This work introduces a Python-based algorithm that automates the generation of reaction templates for the LAMMPS REACTION package, leveraging graph-theoretical principles and sub-graph isomorphism techniques. By representing molecular systems as mathematical graphs, the method enables automated identification of conserved molecular domains, reaction sites, and atom mappings, significantly reducing manual effort. The algorithm was validated on three case studies: poly-addition, poly-condensation, and chain polymerization, demonstrating its ability to map conserved regions, identify reaction-initiating atoms, and resolve challenges such as symmetric reactants and indistinguishable atoms. Additionally, the generated templates were optimized for computational efficiency by retaining only essential reactive domains, ensuring scalability and consistency in high-throughput workflows for computational chemistry, materials science, and machine learning applications. Future work will focus on extending the method to mixed organic-inorganic systems, incorporating adaptive scoring mechanisms, and integrating quantum mechanical calculations to enhance its applicability.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we introduce a novel Straight-Line Diffusion Model (SLDM) to tackle this problem, by formulating the diffusion process to follow a linear trajectory. The proposed process aligns well with the noise sensitivity characteristic of molecular structures and uniformly distributes reconstruction effort across the generative process, thus enhancing learning efficiency and efficacy. Consequently, SLDM achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D molecule generation benchmarks, delivering a 100-fold improvement in sampling efficiency. Furthermore, experiments on toy data and image generation tasks validate the generality and robustness of SLDM, showcasing its potential across diverse generative modeling domains.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we have developed P2DFlow, a generative model based on SE(3) flow matching, to predict the structural ensembles of proteins. We specifically designed a valuable prior for the flow process and enhanced the model's ability to distinguish each intermediate state by incorporating an additional dimension to describe the ensemble data, which can reflect the physical laws governing the distribution of ensembles, so that the prior knowledge can effectively guide the generation process. When trained and evaluated on the MD datasets of ATLAS, P2DFlow outperforms other baseline models on extensive experiments, successfully capturing the observable dynamic fluctuations as evidenced in crystal structure and MD simulations. As a potential proxy agent for protein molecular simulation, the high-quality ensembles generated by P2DFlow could significantly aid in understanding protein functions across various scenarios.

Some gradient-free guidance methods have been developed, but they often struggle to achieve optimal inference-time alignment. In this work, we newly frame inference-time alignment in diffusion as a search problem and propose Dynamic Search for Diffusion (DSearch), which subsamples from denoising processes and approximates intermediate node rewards. It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in atom- and motif-wise deep learning models for 3D molecular generation, current methods often struggle with validity and reliability. To address these issues, we develop the Atom-Motif Consistency Diffusion Model (AMDiff), utilizing a joint-training paradigm for multi-view learning. This model features a hierarchical diffusion architecture that integrates both atom- and motif-level views of molecules, allowing for comprehensive exploration of complementary information. By leveraging classifier-free guidance and incorporating binding site features as conditional inputs, AMDiff ensures robust molecule generation across diverse targets. Compared to existing approaches, AMDiff exhibits superior validity and novelty in generating molecules tailored to fit various protein pockets. Case studies targeting protein kinases, including Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) and Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), demonstrate the model's capability in structure-based de novo drug design.

SymDiff resembles a learned data augmentation that is deployed at sampling time, and is lightweight, computationally efficient, and easy to implement on top of arbitrary off-the-shelf models. In contrast to previous work, SymDiff typically does not require any neural network components that are intrinsically equivariant, avoiding the need for complex parameterisations or the use of higher-order geometric features. Instead, our method can leverage highly scalable modern architectures as drop-in replacements for these more constrained alternatives. We show that this additional flexibility yields significant empirical benefit for $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariant molecular generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of symmetrisation to generative modelling, suggesting its potential in this domain more generally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods fall into PC-Free and PC-Aware categories based on their use of 3D point clouds (PC). PC-Free models prioritize diversity but suffer from lower validity due to overlooking PC constraints, while PC-Aware models ensure higher validity but restrict diversity by enforcing strict PC constraints. To overcome these trade-offs without additional training, we propose HybridLinker, a framework that enhances PC-Aware inference by providing diverse bonding topologies from a pretrained PC-Free model as guidance. At its core, we propose LinkerDPS, the first diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) method operating across PC-Free and PC-Aware spaces, bridging molecular topology with 3D point clouds via an energy-inspired function. By transferring the diverse sampling distribution of PC-Free models into the PC-Aware distribution, HybridLinker significantly and consistently surpasses baselines, improving both validity and diversity in foundational molecular design and applied property optimization tasks, establishing a new DPS framework in the molecular and graph domains beyond imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Auto-encoding Molecules: Graph-Matching Capabilities Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00426v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoencoders are effective deep learning models that can function as generative models and learn latent representations for downstream tasks. The use of graph autoencoders - with both encoder and decoder implemented as message passing networks - is intriguing due to their ability to generate permutation-invariant graph representations. However, this approach faces difficulties because decoding a graph structure from a single vector is challenging, and comparing input and output graphs requires an effective permutation-invariant similarity measure. As a result, many studies rely on approximate methods. In this work, we explore the effect of graph matching precision on the training behavior and generation capabilities of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we propose a transformer-based message passing graph decoder as an alternative to a graph neural network decoder, that is more robust and expressive by leveraging global attention mechanisms. (2) We show that the precision of graph matching has significant impact on training behavior and is essential for effective de novo (molecular) graph generation.

Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training of the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, the offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in the real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively.

Addressing these limitations, we propose Semla, a scalable E(3)-equivariant message passing architecture. We further introduce an unconditional 3D molecular generation model, SemlaFlow, which is trained using equivariant flow matching to generate a joint distribution over atom types, coordinates, bond types and formal charges. Our model produces state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with as few as 20 sampling steps, corresponding to a two order-of-magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight limitations of current evaluation methods for 3D generation and propose new benchmark metrics for unconditional molecular generators. Finally, using these new metrics, we compare our model's ability to generate high quality samples against current approaches and further demonstrate SemlaFlow's strong performance.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |

Inspired by recent studies, which demonstrate that diffusion model, a prominent generative approach, can learn meaningful data representations that enhance predictive tasks, we explore the potential for developing a unified generative model in the molecular domain that effectively addresses both molecular generation and property prediction tasks. However, the integration of these tasks is challenging due to inherent inconsistencies, making simple multi-task learning ineffective. To address this, we propose UniGEM, the first unified model to successfully integrate molecular generation and property prediction, delivering superior performance in both tasks. Our key innovation lies in a novel two-phase generative process, where predictive tasks are activated in the later stages, after the molecular scaffold is formed. We further enhance task balance through innovative training strategies. Rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in both tasks. The principles behind UniGEM hold promise for broader applications, including natural language processing and computer vision.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Language models and graph-based models are extensively utilized within this domain, consistently achieving state-of-the-art results across an array of tasks. However, the prevailing practice of representing chemical compounds in the SMILES format -- used by most datasets and many language models -- presents notable limitations as a training data format. In contrast, chemical fingerprints offer a more physically informed representation of compounds, thereby enhancing their suitability for model training. This study aims to develop a language model that is specifically trained on fingerprints. Furthermore, we introduce a bimodal architecture that integrates this language model with a graph model. Our proposed methodology synthesizes these approaches, utilizing RoBERTa as the language model and employing Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graphormer as graph models. This integration results in a significant improvement in predictive performance compared to conventional strategies for tasks such as Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) and the prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, among others.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, retrieval-augmented generation has become a principled approach commonly used with language models. However, the optimal integration of retrieval augmentation into molecular machine learning remains unclear. Graph neural networks stand to benefit from clever matching to understand the structural alignment of retrieved molecules to a query molecule. Neural graph matching offers a compelling solution by explicitly modeling node and edge affinities between two structural graphs while employing a noise-robust, end-to-end neural network to learn affinity metrics. We apply this approach to mass spectrum simulation and introduce MARASON, a novel model that incorporates neural graph matching to enhance a fragmentation-based neural network. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our design, with MARASON achieving 28% top-1 accuracy, a substantial improvement over the non-retrieval state-of-the-art accuracy of 19%. Moreover, MARASON outperforms both naive retrieval-augmented generation methods and traditional graph matching approaches.</p></details> |  |

The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.</p></details> |  |

Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in interpreting molecular structures, their instruction datasets are limited to the specific knowledge from task-oriented datasets and do not fully cover the fundamental characteristics of molecules, hindering their abilities as general-purpose molecular assistants. To address this issue, we propose Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules via multi-modal instruction tuning. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental features of molecules, incorporating essential knowledge from molecular structures. In addition, to improve understanding of molecular features, we introduce a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of different molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and generating relevant responses to users' queries with detailed explanations, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.

Traditional generative models often struggle with limited training data, particularly in drug discovery, where molecular datasets for specific therapeutic targets, such as nucleic acids binders and central nervous system (CNS) drugs, are scarce. ADSeqGAN addresses this challenge by integrating an auxiliary random forest classifier as an additional discriminator into the GAN framework, significantly improves molecular generation quality and class specificity. Our method incorporates pretrained generator and Wasserstein distance to enhance training stability and diversity. We evaluate ADSeqGAN on a dataset comprising nucleic acid-targeting and protein-targeting small molecules, demonstrating its superior ability to generate nucleic acid binders compared to baseline models such as SeqGAN, ORGAN, and MolGPT. Through an oversampling strategy, ADSeqGAN also significantly improves CNS drug generation, achieving a higher yield than traditional de novo models. Critical assessments, including docking simulations and molecular property analysis, confirm that ADSeqGAN-generated molecules exhibit strong binding affinities, enhanced chemical diversity, and improved synthetic feasibility. Overall, ADSeqGAN presents a novel framework for generative molecular design in data-scarce scenarios, offering potential applications in computational drug discovery. We have demonstrated the successful applications of ADSeqGAN in generating synthetic nucleic acid-targeting and CNS drugs in this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating $π$-Functional Molecules Using STGG+ with Active Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14842v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating novel molecules with out-of-distribution properties is a major challenge in molecular discovery. While supervised learning methods generate high-quality molecules similar to those in a dataset, they struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution properties. Reinforcement learning can explore new chemical spaces but often conducts 'reward-hacking' and generates non-synthesizable molecules. In this work, we address this problem by integrating a state-of-the-art supervised learning method, STGG+, in an active learning loop. Our approach iteratively generates, evaluates, and fine-tunes STGG+ to continuously expand its knowledge. We denote this approach STGG+AL. We apply STGG+AL to the design of organic $\pi$-functional materials, specifically two challenging tasks: 1) generating highly absorptive molecules characterized by high oscillator strength and 2) designing absorptive molecules with reasonable oscillator strength in the near-infrared (NIR) range. The generated molecules are validated and rationalized in-silico with time-dependent density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that our method is highly effective in generating novel molecules with high oscillator strength, contrary to existing methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We open-source our active-learning code along with our Conjugated-xTB dataset containing 2.9 million $\pi$-conjugated molecules and the function for approximating the oscillator strength and absorption wavelength (based on sTDA-xTB).</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/STGG-AL</p></details> |

This approach reduces computational complexity while maintaining high chemical validity, enabling more efficient and scalable molecular generation. We benchmark FragFM against state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based models on standard molecular generation benchmarks and natural product datasets, demonstrating superior performance in validity, property control, and sampling efficiency. Notably, FragFM achieves over 99\% validity with significantly fewer sampling steps, improving scalability while preserving molecular diversity. These results highlight the potential of fragment-based generative modeling for large-scale, property-aware molecular design, paving the way for more efficient exploration of chemical space.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 figures, under review</p></details> |

Existing methods primarily focus on single-scale features, overlooking the hierarchical molecular structures that determine different molecular properties. To address these issues, we introduce Universal Matching Networks (UniMatch), a dual matching framework that integrates explicit hierarchical molecular matching with implicit task-level matching via meta-learning, bridging multi-level molecular representations and task-level generalization. Specifically, our approach explicitly captures structural features across multiple levels, such as atoms, substructures, and molecules, via hierarchical pooling and matching, facilitating precise molecular representation and comparison. Additionally, we employ a meta-learning strategy for implicit task-level matching, allowing the model to capture shared patterns across tasks and quickly adapt to new ones. This unified matching framework ensures effective molecular alignment while leveraging shared meta-knowledge for fast adaptation. Our experimental results demonstrate that UniMatch outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the MoleculeNet and FS-Mol benchmarks, achieving improvements of 2.87% in AUROC and 6.52% in delta AUPRC. UniMatch also shows excellent generalization ability on the Meta-MolNet benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as ICLR 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Diverse Molecules? Towards Alignment with Structural Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03138v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in molecular generation, which offers potential to accelerate drug discovery. However, the current LLMs overlook a critical requirement for drug discovery: proposing a diverse set of molecules. This diversity is essential for improving the chances of finding a viable drug, as it provides alternative molecules that may succeed where others fail in real-world validations. Nevertheless, the LLMs often output structurally similar molecules. While decoding schemes like diverse beam search may enhance textual diversity, this often does not align with molecular structural diversity. In response, we propose a new method for fine-tuning molecular generative LLMs to autoregressively generate a set of structurally diverse molecules, where each molecule is generated by conditioning on the previously generated molecules. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) supervised fine-tuning to adapt LLMs to autoregressively generate molecules in a sequence and (2) reinforcement learning to maximize structural diversity within the generated molecules. Our experiments show that the proposed approach enables LLMs to generate diverse molecules better than existing approaches for diverse sequence generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MING: A Functional Approach to Learning Molecular Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12522v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional molecule generation methods often rely on sequence- or graph-based representations, which can limit their expressive power or require complex permutation-equivariant architectures. This paper introduces a novel paradigm for learning molecule generative models based on functional representations. Specifically, we propose Molecular Implicit Neural Generation (MING), a diffusion-based model that learns molecular distributions in the function space. Unlike standard diffusion processes in the data space, MING employs a novel functional denoising probabilistic process, which jointly denoises information in both the function's input and output spaces by leveraging an expectation-maximization procedure for latent implicit neural representations of data. This approach enables a simple yet effective model design that accurately captures underlying function distributions. Experimental results on molecule-related datasets demonstrate MING's superior performance and ability to generate plausible molecular samples, surpassing state-of-the-art data-space methods while offering a more streamlined architecture and significantly faster generation times.

| **[Conformal Generative Modeling with Improved Sample Efficiency through Sequential Greedy Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01660v2)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models lack rigorous statistical guarantees for their outputs and are therefore unreliable in safety-critical applications. In this work, we propose Sequential Conformal Prediction for Generative Models (SCOPE-Gen), a sequential conformal prediction method producing prediction sets that satisfy a rigorous statistical guarantee called conformal admissibility control. This guarantee states that with high probability, the prediction sets contain at least one admissible (or valid) example. To this end, our method first samples an initial set of i.i.d. examples from a black box generative model. Then, this set is iteratively pruned via so-called greedy filters. As a consequence of the iterative generation procedure, admissibility of the final prediction set factorizes as a Markov chain. This factorization is crucial, because it allows to control each factor separately, using conformal prediction. In comparison to prior work, our method demonstrates a large reduction in the number of admissibility evaluations during calibration. This reduction is important in safety-critical applications, where these evaluations must be conducted manually by domain experts and are therefore costly and time consuming. We highlight the advantages of our method in terms of admissibility evaluations and cardinality of the prediction sets through experiments in natural language generation and molecular graph extension tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MassSpecGym: A benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23326v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery and identification of molecules in biological and environmental samples is crucial for advancing biomedical and chemical sciences. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the leading technique for high-throughput elucidation of molecular structures. However, decoding a molecular structure from its mass spectrum is exceptionally challenging, even when performed by human experts. As a result, the vast majority of acquired MS/MS spectra remain uninterpreted, thereby limiting our understanding of the underlying (bio)chemical processes. Despite decades of progress in machine learning applications for predicting molecular structures from MS/MS spectra, the development of new methods is severely hindered by the lack of standard datasets and evaluation protocols. To address this problem, we propose MassSpecGym -- the first comprehensive benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules from MS/MS data. Our benchmark comprises the largest publicly available collection of high-quality labeled MS/MS spectra and defines three MS/MS annotation challenges: de novo molecular structure generation, molecule retrieval, and spectrum simulation. It includes new evaluation metrics and a generalization-demanding data split, therefore standardizing the MS/MS annotation tasks and rendering the problem accessible to the broad machine learning community. MassSpecGym is publicly available at https://github.com/pluskal-lab/MassSpecGym.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmetry-Preserving Diffusion Models via Target Symmetrization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09890v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are powerful tools for capturing complex distributions, but modeling data with inherent symmetries, such as molecular structures, remains challenging. Equivariant denoisers are commonly used to address this, but they introduce architectural complexity and optimization challenges, including noisy gradients and convergence issues. We propose a novel approach that enforces equivariance through a symmetrized loss function, which applies a time-dependent weighted averaging operation over group actions to the model's prediction target. This ensures equivariance without explicit architectural constraints and reduces gradient variance, leading to more stable and efficient optimization. Our method uses Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the average, incurring minimal computational overhead. We provide theoretical guarantees of equivariance for the minimizer of our loss function and demonstrate its effectiveness on synthetic datasets and the molecular conformation generation task using the GEOM-QM9 dataset. Experiments show improved sample quality compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of our approach to enhance the scalability and practicality of equivariant diffusion models in generative tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffMS: Diffusion Generation of Molecules Conditioned on Mass Spectra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09571v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mass spectrometry plays a fundamental role in elucidating the structures of unknown molecules and subsequent scientific discoveries. One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional $\textit{de novo}$ generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on $\textit{de novo}$ molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size. DiffMS code is publicly available at https://github.com/coleygroup/DiffMS.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Diffusion Models for Molecules: A Survey of Methods and Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09511v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative tasks about molecules, including but not limited to molecule generation, are crucial for drug discovery and material design, and have consistently attracted significant attention. In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as an impressive class of deep generative models, sparking extensive research and leading to numerous studies on their application to molecular generative tasks. Despite the proliferation of related work, there remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this area. Particularly, due to the diversity of diffusion model formulations, molecular data modalities, and generative task types, the research landscape is challenging to navigate, hindering understanding and limiting the area's growth. To address this, this paper conducts a comprehensive survey of diffusion model-based molecular generative methods. We systematically review the research from the perspectives of methodological formulations, data modalities, and task types, offering a novel taxonomy. This survey aims to facilitate understanding and further flourishing development in this area.

| **[Enhancing Diffusion Models Efficiency by Disentangling Total-Variance and Signal-to-Noise Ratio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08598v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long sampling time of diffusion models remains a significant bottleneck, which can be mitigated by reducing the number of diffusion time steps. However, the quality of samples with fewer steps is highly dependent on the noise schedule, i.e., the specific manner in which noise is introduced and the signal is reduced at each step. Although prior work has improved upon the original variance-preserving and variance-exploding schedules, these approaches $\textit{passively}$ adjust the total variance, without direct control over it. In this work, we propose a novel total-variance/signal-to-noise-ratio disentangled (TV/SNR) framework, where TV and SNR can be controlled independently. Our approach reveals that different existing schedules, where the TV explodes exponentially, can be $\textit{improved}$ by setting a constant TV schedule while preserving the same SNR schedule. Furthermore, generalizing the SNR schedule of the optimal transport flow matching significantly improves the performance in molecular structure generation, achieving few step generation of stable molecules. A similar tendency is observed in image generation, where our approach with a uniform diffusion time grid performs comparably to the highly tailored EDM sampler.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Representation Condition Improves Equivariant Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03655v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in molecular generative models have demonstrated substantial potential in accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often face challenges in generating high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to enhance the performance of molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the molecule generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared to directly generating a molecule, the relatively easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second-stage generation to reach a high-quality molecule in a more goal-oriented and much faster way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as the base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation tasks on the widely-used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 31\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations over conditioning on individual property values as in previous approaches. Furthermore, we show that, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly accelerating the generation process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation of Molecules via Algebraic Data Types : Advancing Beyond SMILES & SELFIES](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13633v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel molecular representation through Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) - composite data structures formed through the combination of simpler types that obey algebraic laws. By explicitly considering how the datatype of a representation constrains the operations which may be performed, we ensure meaningful inference can be performed over generative models (programs with sample} and score operations). This stands in contrast to string-based representations where string-type operations may only indirectly correspond to chemical and physical molecular properties, and at worst produce nonsensical output. The ADT presented implements the Dietz representation for molecular constitution via multigraphs and bonding systems, and uses atomic coordinate data to represent 3D information and stereochemical features. This creates a general digital molecular representation which surpasses the limitations of the string-based representations and the 2D-graph based models on which they are based. In addition, we present novel support for quantum information through representation of shells, subshells, and orbitals, greatly expanding the representational scope beyond current approaches, for instance in Molecular Orbital theory. The framework's capabilities are demonstrated through key applications: Bayesian probabilistic programming is demonstrated through integration with LazyPPL, a lazy probabilistic programming library; molecules are made instances of a group under rotation, necessary for geometric learning techniques which exploit the invariance of molecular properties under different representations; and the framework's flexibility is demonstrated through an extension to model chemical reactions. After critiquing previous representations, we provide an open-source solution in Haskell - a type-safe, purely functional programming language.</p></details> | 1 Figure |
| **[Representational Alignment with Chemical Induced Fit for Molecular Relational Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07027v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) is widely applied in natural sciences to predict relationships between molecular pairs by extracting structural features. The representational similarity between substructure pairs determines the functional compatibility of molecular binding sites. Nevertheless, aligning substructure representations by attention mechanisms lacks guidance from chemical knowledge, resulting in unstable model performance in chemical space (\textit{e.g.}, functional group, scaffold) shifted data. With theoretical justification, we propose the \textbf{Re}presentational \textbf{Align}ment with Chemical Induced \textbf{Fit} (ReAlignFit) to enhance the stability of MRL. ReAlignFit dynamically aligns substructure representation in MRL by introducing chemical Induced Fit-based inductive bias. In the induction process, we design the Bias Correction Function based on substructure edge reconstruction to align representations between substructure pairs by simulating chemical conformational changes (dynamic combination of substructures). ReAlignFit further integrates the Subgraph Information Bottleneck during fit process to refine and optimize substructure pairs exhibiting high chemical functional compatibility, leveraging them to generate molecular embeddings. Experimental results on nine datasets demonstrate that ReAlignFit outperforms state-of-the-art models in two tasks and significantly enhances model's stability in both rule-shifted and scaffold-shifted data distributions.</p></details> |  |

Although diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, these models typically adapt from the frameworks designed for image generation, making them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose a novel Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff) model that follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum and is guided by higher-order information, enabling the progressive generation of plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiminghh/HOG-Diff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mol-LLM: Generalist Molecular LLM with Improved Graph Utilization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02810v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have motivated the development of general LLMs for molecular tasks. While several studies have demonstrated that fine-tuned LLMs can achieve impressive benchmark performances, they are far from genuine generalist molecular LLMs due to a lack of fundamental understanding of molecular structure. Specifically, when given molecular task instructions, LLMs trained with naive next-token prediction training assign similar likelihood scores to both original and negatively corrupted molecules, revealing their lack of molecular structure understanding that is crucial for reliable and general molecular LLMs. To overcome this limitation and obtain a true generalist molecular LLM, we introduce a novel multi-modal training method based on a thorough multi-modal instruction tuning as well as a molecular structure preference optimization between chosen and rejected graphs. On various molecular benchmarks, the proposed generalist molecular LLM, called Mol-LLM, achieves state-of-the-art performances among generalist LLMs on most tasks, at the same time, surpassing or comparable to state-of-the-art specialist LLMs. Moreover, Mol-LLM also shows superior generalization performances in reaction prediction tasks, demonstrating the effect of the molecular structure understanding for generalization perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling on Lie Groups via Euclidean Generalized Score Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02513v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We extend Euclidean score-based diffusion processes to generative modeling on Lie groups. Through the formalism of Generalized Score Matching, our approach yields a Langevin dynamics which decomposes as a direct sum of Lie algebra representations, enabling generative processes on Lie groups while operating in Euclidean space. Unlike equivariant models, which restrict the space of learnable functions by quotienting out group orbits, our method can model any target distribution on any (non-Abelian) Lie group. Standard score matching emerges as a special case of our framework when the Lie group is the translation group. We prove that our generalized generative processes arise as solutions to a new class of paired stochastic differential equations (SDEs), introduced here for the first time. We validate our approach through experiments on diverse data types, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications such as SO(3)-guided molecular conformer generation and modeling ligand-specific global SE(3) transformations for molecular docking, showing improvement in comparison to Riemannian diffusion on the group itself. We show that an appropriate choice of Lie group enhances learning efficiency by reducing the effective dimensionality of the trajectory space and enables the modeling of transitions between complex data distributions. Additionally, we demonstrate the universality of our approach by deriving how it extends to flow matching.</p></details> | 27 pages |

At the core of our approach is a reversible "flattening" process that transforms graphs into random sequences. By sampling and learning from these sequences, AutoGraph enables transformers to model and generate complex graph structures in a manner akin to natural language. In contrast to diffusion models that rely on computationally intensive node features, our approach operates exclusively on these sequences. The sampling complexity and sequence length scale linearly with the number of edges, making AutoGraph highly scalable for generating large sparse graphs. Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse synthetic and molecular graph generation benchmarks, while delivering a 100-fold generation and a 3-fold training speedup compared to leading diffusion models. Additionally, it demonstrates promising transfer capabilities and supports substructure-conditioned generation without additional fine-tuning. By extending language modeling techniques to graph generation, this work paves the way for developing graph foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Docking-Aware Attention: Dynamic Protein Representations through Molecular Context Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01461v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational prediction of enzymatic reactions represents a crucial challenge in sustainable chemical synthesis across various scientific domains, ranging from drug discovery to materials science and green chemistry. These syntheses rely on proteins that selectively catalyze complex molecular transformations. These protein catalysts exhibit remarkable substrate adaptability, with the same protein often catalyzing different chemical transformations depending on its molecular partners. Current approaches to protein representation in reaction prediction either ignore protein structure entirely or rely on static embeddings, failing to capture how proteins dynamically adapt their behavior to different substrates. We present Docking-Aware Attention (DAA), a novel architecture that generates dynamic, context-dependent protein representations by incorporating molecular docking information into the attention mechanism. DAA combines physical interaction scores from docking predictions with learned attention patterns to focus on protein regions most relevant to specific molecular interactions. We evaluate our method on enzymatic reaction prediction, where it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 62.2\% accuracy versus 56.79\% on complex molecules and 55.54\% versus 49.45\% on innovative reactions. Through detailed ablation studies and visualizations, we demonstrate how DAA generates interpretable attention patterns that adapt to different molecular contexts. Our approach represents a general framework for context-aware protein representation in biocatalysis prediction, with potential applications across enzymatic synthesis planning. We open-source our implementation and pre-trained models to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable Boltzmann Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14426v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of equilibrium samples of molecular systems has been a long-standing problem in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators are a generative machine learning method that addresses this issue by learning a transformation via a normalizing flow from a simple prior distribution to the target Boltzmann distribution of interest. Recently, flow matching has been employed to train Boltzmann Generators for small molecular systems in Cartesian coordinates. We extend this work and propose a first framework for Boltzmann Generators that are transferable across chemical space, such that they predict zero-shot Boltzmann distributions for test molecules without being retrained for these systems. These transferable Boltzmann Generators allow approximate sampling from the target distribution of unseen systems, as well as efficient reweighting to the target Boltzmann distribution. The transferability of the proposed framework is evaluated on dipeptides, where we show that it generalizes efficiently to unseen systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed architecture enhances the efficiency of Boltzmann Generators trained on single molecular systems.</p></details> |  |

Here we introduce the QMe14S dataset, comprising 186,102 small organic molecules featuring 14 elements (H, B, C, N, O, F, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, As, Se, Br) and 47 functional groups. Using density functional theory at the B3LYP/TZVP level, we optimized the geometries and calculated properties including energy, atomic charge, atomic force, dipole moment, quadrupole moment, polarizability, octupole moment, first hyperpolarizability, and Hessian. At the same level, we obtained the harmonic IR, Raman and NMR spectra. Furthermore, we conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to generate dynamic configurations and extract nonequilibrium properties, including energy, forces, and Hessians. By leveraging our E(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network (DetaNet), we demonstrated that models trained on QMe14S outperform those trained on the previously developed QM9S dataset in simulating molecular spectra. The QMe14S dataset thus serves as a comprehensive benchmark for molecular simulations, offering valuable insights into structure-property relationships.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4figures |

Despite their strong predictive capabilities, these models lack a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty, which is key in scientific applications such as PDE solving, molecular generation and Machine Learning Force Fields. To address this shortcoming we present BARNN: a variational Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network. BARNNs aim to provide a principled way to turn any autoregressive or recurrent model into its Bayesian version. BARNN is based on the variational dropout method, allowing to apply it to large recurrent neural networks as well. We also introduce a temporal version of the "Variational Mixtures of Posteriors" prior (tVAMP-prior) to make Bayesian inference efficient and well-calibrated. Extensive experiments on PDE modelling and molecular generation demonstrate that BARNN not only achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, but also excels in uncertainty quantification and modelling long-range dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pesti-Gen: Unleashing a Generative Molecule Approach for Toxicity Aware Pesticide Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14469v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global climate change has reduced crop resilience and pesticide efficacy, making reliance on synthetic pesticides inevitable, even though their widespread use poses significant health and environmental risks. While these pesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning applications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or regression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular structures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Pesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders, designed to create pesticide candidates with optimized properties for the first time. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an initial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure representation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates toxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple toxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity to generate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Notably, Pesti-Gen achieves approximately 68\% structural validity in generating new molecular structures, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in producing optimized and feasible pesticide candidates, thereby providing a new way for safer and more sustainable pest management solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for chemicals. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Discrete Denoising Diffusion Model for Molecular Generation with OpenFL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12523v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating unique molecules with biochemically desired properties to serve as viable drug candidates is a difficult task that requires specialized domain expertise. In recent years, diffusion models have shown promising results in accelerating the drug design process through AI-driven molecular generation. However, training these models requires massive amounts of data, which are often isolated in proprietary silos. OpenFL is a federated learning framework that enables privacy-preserving collaborative training across these decentralized data sites. In this work, we present a federated discrete denoising diffusion model that was trained using OpenFL. The federated model achieves comparable performance with a model trained on centralized data when evaluating the uniqueness and validity of the generated molecules. This demonstrates the utility of federated learning in the drug design process. OpenFL is available at: https://github.com/securefederatedai/openfl</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Learning to generate feasible graphs using graph grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06003v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative methods for graphs need to be sufficiently flexible to model complex dependencies between sets of nodes. At the same time, the generated graphs need to satisfy domain-dependent feasibility conditions, that is, they should not violate certain constraints that would make their interpretation impossible within the given application domain (e.g. a molecular graph where an atom has a very large number of chemical bounds). Crucially, constraints can involve not only local but also long-range dependencies: for example, the maximal length of a cycle can be bounded. Currently, a large class of generative approaches for graphs, such as methods based on artificial neural networks, is based on message passing schemes. These approaches suffer from information 'dilution' issues that severely limit the maximal range of the dependencies that can be modeled. To address this problem, we propose a generative approach based on the notion of graph grammars. The key novel idea is to introduce a domain-dependent coarsening procedure to provide short-cuts for long-range dependencies. We show the effectiveness of our proposal in two domains: 1) small drugs and 2) RNA secondary structures. In the first case, we compare the quality of the generated molecular graphs via the Molecular Sets (MOSES) benchmark suite, which evaluates the distance between generated and real molecules, their lipophilicity, synthesizability, and drug-likeness. In the second case, we show that the approach can generate very large graphs (with hundreds of nodes) that are accepted as valid examples for a desired RNA family by the "Infernal" covariance model, a state-of-the-art RNA classifier. Our implementation is available on github: github.com/fabriziocosta/GraphLearn</p></details> |  |

MOFA addresses key challenges in integrating GPU-accelerated computing for GPU-intensive GenAI tasks, including distributed training and inference, alongside CPU- and GPU-optimized tasks for screening and filtering AI-generated MOFs using molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and Monte Carlo simulations. These heterogeneous tasks are unified within an online learning framework that optimizes the utilization of available CPU and GPU resources across HPC systems. Performance metrics from a 450-node (14,400 AMD Zen 3 CPUs + 1800 NVIDIA A100 GPUs) supercomputer run demonstrate that MOFA achieves high-throughput generation of novel MOF structures, with CO$_2$ adsorption capacities ranking among the top 10 in the hypothetical MOF (hMOF) dataset. Furthermore, the production of high-quality MOFs exhibits a linear relationship with the number of nodes utilized. The modular architecture of MOFA will facilitate its integration into other scientific applications that dynamically combine GenAI with large-scale simulations.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Molecular Graph Contrastive Learning with Line Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08589v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trapped by the label scarcity in molecular property prediction and drug design, graph contrastive learning (GCL) came forward. Leading contrastive learning works show two kinds of view generators, that is, random or learnable data corruption and domain knowledge incorporation. While effective, the two ways also lead to molecular semantics altering and limited generalization capability, respectively. To this end, we relate the \textbf{L}in\textbf{E} graph with \textbf{MO}lecular graph co\textbf{N}trastive learning and propose a novel method termed \textit{LEMON}. Specifically, by contrasting the given graph with the corresponding line graph, the graph encoder can freely encode the molecular semantics without omission. Furthermore, we present a new patch with edge attribute fusion and two local contrastive losses enhance information transmission and tackle hard negative samples. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for view generation, superior performance on molecular property prediction suggests the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Using this representation, we propose a new model based on walk-jump sampling for unconditional 3D molecule generation in the continuous space using neural fields. Our model, FuncMol, encodes molecular fields into latent codes using a conditional neural field, samples noisy codes from a Gaussian-smoothed distribution with Langevin MCMC (walk), denoises these samples in a single step (jump), and finally decodes them into molecular fields. FuncMol performs all-atom generation of 3D molecules without assumptions on the molecular structure and scales well with the size of molecules, unlike most approaches. Our method achieves competitive results on drug-like molecules and easily scales to macro-cyclic peptides, with at least one order of magnitude faster sampling.

| **[GDiffRetro: Retrosynthesis Prediction with Dual Graph Enhanced Molecular Representation and Diffusion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08001v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrosynthesis prediction focuses on identifying reactants capable of synthesizing a target product. Typically, the retrosynthesis prediction involves two phases: Reaction Center Identification and Reactant Generation. However, we argue that most existing methods suffer from two limitations in the two phases: (i) Existing models do not adequately capture the ``face'' information in molecular graphs for the reaction center identification. (ii) Current approaches for the reactant generation predominantly use sequence generation in a 2D space, which lacks versatility in generating reasonable distributions for completed reactive groups and overlooks molecules' inherent 3D properties. To overcome the above limitations, we propose GDiffRetro. For the reaction center identification, GDiffRetro uniquely integrates the original graph with its corresponding dual graph to represent molecular structures, which helps guide the model to focus more on the faces in the graph. For the reactant generation, GDiffRetro employs a conditional diffusion model in 3D to further transform the obtained synthon into a complete reactant. Our experimental findings reveal that GDiffRetro outperforms state-of-the-art semi-template models across various evaluative metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[D3MES: Diffusion Transformer with multihead equivariant self-attention for 3D molecule generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07077v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting the diverse conformational states of molecules is crucial for advancing fields such as chemistry, material science, and drug development. Despite significant progress in generative models, accurately generating complex and biologically or material-relevant molecular structures remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model for three-dimensional (3D) molecule generation that combines a classifiable diffusion model, Diffusion Transformer, with multihead equivariant self-attention. This method addresses two key challenges: correctly attaching hydrogen atoms in generated molecules through learning representations of molecules after hydrogen atoms are removed; and overcoming the limitations of existing models that cannot generate molecules across multiple classes simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that our model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across several key metrics but also exhibits robustness and versatility, making it highly suitable for early-stage large-scale generation processes in molecular design, followed by validation and further screening to obtain molecules with specific properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenMol: A Drug Discovery Generalist with Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06158v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is a complex process that involves multiple scenarios and stages, such as fragment-constrained molecule generation, hit generation and lead optimization. However, existing molecular generative models can only tackle one or two of these scenarios and lack the flexibility to address various aspects of the drug discovery pipeline. In this paper, we present Generalist Molecular generative model (GenMol), a versatile framework that addresses these limitations by applying discrete diffusion to the Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) molecular representation. GenMol generates SAFE sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering and enhanced computational efficiency. Moreover, under the discrete diffusion framework, we introduce fragment remasking, a strategy that optimizes molecules by replacing fragments with masked tokens and regenerating them, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model trained on SAFE representations in de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization. These experimental results demonstrate that GenMol can tackle a wide range of drug discovery tasks, providing a unified and versatile approach for molecular design.</p></details> |  |
| **[EquiBoost: An Equivariant Boosting Approach to Molecular Conformation Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05109v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular conformation generation plays key roles in computational drug design. Recently developed deep learning methods, particularly diffusion models have reached competitive performance over traditional cheminformatical approaches. However, these methods are often time-consuming or require extra support from traditional methods. We propose EquiBoost, a boosting model that stacks several equivariant graph transformers as weak learners, to iteratively refine 3D conformations of molecules. Without relying on diffusion techniques, EquiBoost balances accuracy and efficiency more effectively than diffusion-based methods. Notably, compared to the previous state-of-the-art diffusion method, EquiBoost improves generation quality and preserves diversity, achieving considerably better precision of Average Minimum RMSD (AMR) on the GEOM datasets. This work rejuvenates boosting and sheds light on its potential to be a robust alternative to diffusion models in certain scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MADGEN: Mass-Spec attends to De Novo Molecular generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01950v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The annotation (assigning structural chemical identities) of MS/MS spectra remains a significant challenge due to the enormous molecular diversity in biological samples and the limited scope of reference databases. Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the "dark chemical space" without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Exploring Molecule Generation Using Latent Space Graph Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03696v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating molecular graphs is a challenging task due to their discrete nature and the competitive objectives involved. Diffusion models have emerged as SOTA approaches in data generation across various modalities. For molecular graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) as a diffusion backbone have achieved impressive results. Latent space diffusion, where diffusion occurs in a low-dimensional space via an autoencoder, has demonstrated computational efficiency. However, the literature on latent space diffusion for molecular graphs is scarce, and no commonly accepted best practices exist. In this work, we explore different approaches and hyperparameters, contrasting generative flow models (denoising diffusion, flow matching, heat dissipation) and architectures (GNNs and E(3)-equivariant GNNs). Our experiments reveal a high sensitivity to the choice of approach and design decisions.

| **[Navigating Chemical-Linguistic Sharing Space with Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20888v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical language models (CLMs) are prominent for their effectiveness in exploring chemical space and enabling molecular engineering. However, while exploring chemical-linguistic space, CLMs suffer from the gap between natural language and molecular representations. This challenge is primarily due to the inherent modeling differences between molecules and texts: molecules operate unified modeling to learn chemical space, while natural language sequentially models the semantic space. Additionally, the limited availability of high-quality text-to-molecule datasets further exacerbates this challenge. To address the problem, we first verified the information bias in molecular representations from different perspectives. We then developed the Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding (HME) framework, a unified molecular encoder compressing the molecular features from fragment sequence, topology, and conformation with Q-learning. To better model chemical-linguistic space, we further constructed the MCMoD dataset, which contains over one million molecules with various conditions, including properties, fragments, and descriptions. Experimentally, HME promotes CLMs to achieve chemical-linguistic sharing space exploration: (1) chemical space exploration with linguistic guidance, where HME achieves significant improvements (+8.9\% FCD) for molecular design in multiple constraints, even in zero-shot scenarios; (2) linguistic space exploration with molecular guidance, where HME generates textual descriptions with high qualities (+11.6\% BLEU) for molecules. These results highlight the precision of HME in handling multi-objective and cross-domain tasks, as well as its remarkable generalization capability on unseen task combinations. HME offers a new perspective on navigating chemical-linguistic sharing space, advancing the potential of CLMs in both fundamental research and practical applications in chemistry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

We show how applications such as structure-based, fragment-based, and ligand-based drug design are formulated in the UniGuide framework and demonstrate on-par or superior performance compared to specialised models. Offering a more versatile approach, UniGuide has the potential to streamline the development of molecular generative models, allowing them to be readily used in diverse application scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)</p></details> |

We find that a key limitation is not in the molecule generation process itself, but in the poor generalization capabilities of molecular property predictors. We tackle this challenge by creating an active-learning, closed-loop molecule generation pipeline, whereby molecular generative models are iteratively refined on feedback from quantum chemical simulations to improve generalization to new chemical space. Compared against other generative model approaches, only our active learning approach generates molecules with properties that extrapolate beyond the training data (reaching up to 0.44 standard deviations beyond the training data range) and out-of-distribution molecule classification accuracy is improved by 79%. By conditioning molecular generation on thermodynamic stability data from the active-learning loop, the proportion of stable molecules generated is 3.5x higher than the next-best model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gx2Mol: De Novo Generation of Hit-like Molecules from Gene Expression Profiles via Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19422v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>De novo generation of hit-like molecules is a challenging task in the drug discovery process. Most methods in previous studies learn the semantics and syntax of molecular structures by analyzing molecular graphs or simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings; however, they do not take into account the drug responses of the biological systems consisting of genes and proteins. In this study we propose a deep generative model, Gx2Mol, which utilizes gene expression profiles to generate molecular structures with desirable phenotypes for arbitrary target proteins. In the algorithm, a variational autoencoder is employed as a feature extractor to learn the latent feature distribution of the gene expression profiles. Then, a long short-term memory is leveraged as the chemical generator to produce syntactically valid SMILES strings that satisfy the feature conditions of the gene expression profile extracted by the feature extractor. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that the proposed Gx2Mol model can produce new molecules with potential bioactivities and drug-like properties.</p></details> |  |

Dissipativity is a crucial indicator for dynamical systems that generalizes stability and input-output stability, known to be valid across various systems including robotics, biological systems, and molecular dynamics. By analytically proving the general solution to the nonlinear Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for dissipativity, we propose a differentiable projection that transforms any dynamics represented by neural networks into dissipative ones and a learning method for the transformed dynamics. Utilizing the generality of dissipativity, our method strictly guarantee stability, input-output stability, and energy conservation of trained dynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method against out-of-domain input through applications to robotic arms and fluid dynamics.

However, in molecular science, CMs are less common than black-box models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), due to their need for predefined concepts and manual labeling. This paper introduces the Automated Molecular Concept (AutoMolCo) framework, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate and label predictive molecular concepts. Through iterative concept refinement, AutoMolCo enables simple linear models to outperform GNNs and LLM in-context learning on several benchmarks. The framework operates without human knowledge input, overcoming limitations of existing CMs while maintaining explainability and allowing easy intervention. Experiments on MoleculeNet and High-Throughput Experimentation (HTE) datasets demonstrate that AutoMolCo-induced explainable CMs are beneficial for molecular science research.</p></details> |  |

More recently, these workflows have been significantly augmented with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and systems of autonomous agents capable of utilizing pre-trained models to make predictions in the context of more complex research tasks. While effective, there is still room for substantial improvement within agentic systems on the retrieval of salient information for material design tasks. Within this context, alternative uses of predictive deep learning models, such as leveraging their latent representations to facilitate cross-modal retrieval augmented generation within agentic systems for task-specific materials design, has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained chemistry foundation models can serve as a basis for enabling structure-focused, semantic chemistry information retrieval for both small-molecules, complex polymeric materials, and reactions. Additionally, we show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with multi-modal models such as OpenCLIP facilitate unprecedented queries and information retrieval across multiple characterization data domains. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of these models within multi-agent systems to facilitate structure and topological-based natural language queries and information retrieval for different research tasks.</p></details> |  |

Here we hypothesized that ORs can be viewed as 3D spatial filters that extract molecular features relevant to the olfactory system, similarly to the spatio-temporal filters found in other sensory modalities. To build these filters, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict human olfactory percepts obtained from several semantic datasets. Our neural network, the DeepNose, produced responses that are approximately invariant to the molecules' orientation, due to its equivariant architecture. Our network offers high-fidelity perceptual predictions for different olfactory datasets. In addition, our approach allows us to identify molecular features that contribute to specific perceptual descriptors. Because the DeepNose network is designed to be aligned with the biological system, our approach predicts distinct perceptual qualities for different stereoisomers. The architecture of the DeepNose relying on the processing of several molecules at the same time permits inferring the perceptual quality of odor mixtures. We propose that the DeepNose network can use 3D molecular shapes to generate high-quality predictions for human olfactory percepts and help identify molecular features responsible for odor quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, to be appear in the proceedings of Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (ACSSC 2024)</p></details> |

Designed to support AI-driven drug design and discovery, M$^{3}$-20M is 71 times more in the number of molecules than the largest existing dataset, providing an unprecedented scale that can highly benefit training or fine-tuning large (language) models with superior performance for drug design and discovery. This dataset integrates one-dimensional SMILES, two-dimensional molecular graphs, three-dimensional molecular structures, physicochemical properties, and textual descriptions collected through web crawling and generated by using GPT-3.5, offering a comprehensive view of each molecule. To demonstrate the power of M$^{3}$-20M in drug design and discovery, we conduct extensive experiments on two key tasks: molecule generation and molecular property prediction, using large language models including GLM4, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our experimental results show that M$^{3}$-20M can significantly boost model performance in both tasks. Specifically, it enables the models to generate more diverse and valid molecular structures and achieve higher property prediction accuracy than the existing single-modal datasets, which validates the value and potential of M$^{3}$-20M in supporting AI-driven drug design and discovery.

| **[Chimera: Accurate retrosynthesis prediction by ensembling models with diverse inductive biases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05269v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning and conducting chemical syntheses remains a major bottleneck in the discovery of functional small molecules, and prevents fully leveraging generative AI for molecular inverse design. While early work has shown that ML-based retrosynthesis models can predict reasonable routes, their low accuracy for less frequent, yet important reactions has been pointed out. As multi-step search algorithms are limited to reactions suggested by the underlying model, the applicability of those tools is inherently constrained by the accuracy of retrosynthesis prediction. Inspired by how chemists use different strategies to ideate reactions, we propose Chimera: a framework for building highly accurate reaction models that combine predictions from diverse sources with complementary inductive biases using a learning-based ensembling strategy. We instantiate the framework with two newly developed models, which already by themselves achieve state of the art in their categories. Through experiments across several orders of magnitude in data scale and time-splits, we show Chimera outperforms all major models by a large margin, owing both to the good individual performance of its constituents, but also to the scalability of our ensembling strategy. Moreover, we find that PhD-level organic chemists prefer predictions from Chimera over baselines in terms of quality. Finally, we transfer the largest-scale checkpoint to an internal dataset from a major pharmaceutical company, showing robust generalization under distribution shift. With the new dimension that our framework unlocks, we anticipate further acceleration in the development of even more accurate models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMDM:Latent Molecular Diffusion Model For 3D Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04242v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>n this work, we propose a latent molecular diffusion model that can make the generated 3D molecules rich in diversity and maintain rich geometric features. The model captures the information of the forces and local constraints between atoms so that the generated molecules can maintain Euclidean transformation and high level of effectiveness and diversity. We also use the lowerrank manifold advantage of the latent variables of the latent model to fuse the information of the forces between atoms to better maintain the geometric equivariant properties of the molecules. Because there is no need to perform information fusion encoding in stages like traditional encoders and decoders, this reduces the amount of calculation in the back-propagation process. The model keeps the forces and local constraints of particle bonds in the latent variable space, reducing the impact of underfitting on the surface of the network on the large position drift of the particle geometry, so that our model can converge earlier. We introduce a distribution control variable in each backward step to strengthen exploration and improve the diversity of generation. In the experiment, the quality of the samples we generated and the convergence speed of the model have been significantly improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.05710 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Tokenizing 3D Molecule Structure with Quantized Spherical Coordinates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01564v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of language models (LMs) to molecular structure generation using line notations such as SMILES and SELFIES has been well-established in the field of cheminformatics. However, extending these models to generate 3D molecular structures presents significant challenges. Two primary obstacles emerge: (1) the difficulty in designing a 3D line notation that ensures SE(3)-invariant atomic coordinates, and (2) the non-trivial task of tokenizing continuous coordinates for use in LMs, which inherently require discrete inputs. To address these challenges, we propose Mol-StrucTok, a novel method for tokenizing 3D molecular structures. Our approach comprises two key innovations: (1) We design a line notation for 3D molecules by extracting local atomic coordinates in a spherical coordinate system. This notation builds upon existing 2D line notations and remains agnostic to their specific forms, ensuring compatibility with various molecular representation schemes. (2) We employ a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to tokenize these coordinates, treating them as generation descriptors. To further enhance the representation, we incorporate neighborhood bond lengths and bond angles as understanding descriptors.

While traditional methods for designing new ionizable lipids are typically time-consuming, deep generative models have emerged as a powerful solution, significantly accelerating the molecular discovery process. However, a practical challenge arises as the molecular structures generated can often be difficult or infeasible to synthesize. This project explores Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)-based generative models for synthesizable ionizable lipids. Leveraging a synthetically accessible lipid building block dataset and two specialized predictors to guide the search through chemical space, we introduce a policy network guided MCTS generative model capable of producing new ionizable lipids with available synthesis pathways.</p></details> |  |
| **[Riemannian Denoising Score Matching for Molecular Structure Optimization with Accurate Energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19769v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a modified score matching method aimed at generating molecular structures with high energy accuracy. The denoising process of score matching or diffusion models mirrors molecular structure optimization, where scores act like physical force fields that guide particles toward equilibrium states. To achieve energetically accurate structures, it can be advantageous to have the score closely approximate the gradient of the actual potential energy surface. Unlike conventional methods that simply design the target score based on structural differences in Euclidean space, we propose a Riemannian score matching approach. This method represents molecular structures on a manifold defined by physics-informed internal coordinates to efficiently mimic the energy landscape, and performs noising and denoising within this space. Our method has been evaluated by refining several types of starting structures on the QM9 and GEOM datasets, demonstrating that the proposed Riemannian score matching method significantly improves the accuracy of the generated molecular structures, attaining chemical accuracy. The implications of this study extend to various applications in computational chemistry, offering a robust tool for accurate molecular structure prediction.</p></details> |  |

| **[Balancing Molecular Information and Empirical Data in the Prediction of Physico-Chemical Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08075v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the physico-chemical properties of pure substances and mixtures is a central task in thermodynamics. Established prediction methods range from fully physics-based ab-initio calculations, which are only feasible for very simple systems, over descriptor-based methods that use some information on the molecules to be modeled together with fitted model parameters (e.g., quantitative-structure-property relationship methods or classical group contribution methods), to representation-learning methods, which may, in extreme cases, completely ignore molecular descriptors and extrapolate only from existing data on the property to be modeled (e.g., matrix completion methods). In this work, we propose a general method for combining molecular descriptors with representation learning using the so-called expectation maximization algorithm from the probabilistic machine learning literature, which uses uncertainty estimates to trade off between the two approaches. The proposed hybrid model exploits chemical structure information using graph neural networks, but it automatically detects cases where structure-based predictions are unreliable, in which case it corrects them by representation-learning based predictions that can better specialize to unusual cases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the prediction of activity coefficients in binary mixtures as an example. The results are compelling, as the method significantly improves predictive accuracy over the current state of the art, showcasing its potential to advance the prediction of physico-chemical properties in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, including 11 pages of main text and 3 pages of appendix, added analysis of improvements in predictive accuracy, added Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7</p></details> |

Flow matching is a recently proposed generative modeling framework that has achieved impressive performance on a variety of tasks including those on biomolecular structures. The seminal flow matching framework was developed only for continuous data. However, de novo molecular design tasks require generating discrete data such as atomic elements or sequences of amino acid residues. Several discrete flow matching methods have been proposed recently to address this gap. In this work we benchmark the performance of existing discrete flow matching methods for 3D de novo small molecule generation and provide explanations of their differing behavior. As a result we present FlowMol-CTMC, an open-source model that achieves state of the art performance for 3D de novo design with fewer learnable parameters than existing methods. Additionally, we propose the use of metrics that capture molecule quality beyond local chemical valency constraints and towards higher-order structural motifs. These metrics show that even though basic constraints are satisfied, the models tend to produce unusual and potentially problematic functional groups outside of the training data distribution. Code and trained models for reproducing this work are available at \url{https://github.com/dunni3/FlowMol}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the NeurIPS 2024 Machine Learning for Structural Biology Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Limeade: Let integer molecular encoding aid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16623v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is a well-established framework for computer-aided molecular design (CAMD). By precisely encoding the molecular space and score functions, e.g., a graph neural network, the molecular design problem is represented and solved as an optimization problem, the solution of which corresponds to a molecule with optimal score. However, both the extremely large search space and complicated scoring process limit the use of MIP-based CAMD to specific and tiny problems. Moreover, optimal molecule may not be meaningful in practice if scores are imperfect. Instead of pursuing optimality, this paper exploits the ability of MIP in molecular generation and proposes Limeade as an end-to-end tool from real-world needs to feasible molecules. Beyond the basic constraints for structural feasibility, Limeade supports inclusion and exclusion of SMARTS patterns, automating the process of interpreting and formulating chemical requirements to mathematical constraints.</p></details> | 32 pages, 2 figures |

However, molecules are not solely characterized by atom/bond symbols; they encapsulate important physical/chemical properties. Moreover, normal language models bring grammar rules that are irrelevant for understanding molecules. In this study, we propose a novel physicochemical knowledge-guided molecular meta language framework MolMetaLM. We design a molecule-specialized meta language paradigm, formatted as multiple <S,P,O> (subject, predicate, object) knowledge triples sharing the same S (i.e., molecule) to enhance learning the semantic relationships between physicochemical knowledge and molecules. By introducing different molecular knowledge and noises, the meta language paradigm generates tens of thousands of pretraining tasks. By recovering the token/sequence/order-level noises, MolMetaLM exhibits proficiency in large-scale benchmark evaluations involving property prediction, molecule generation, conformation inference, and molecular optimization. Through MolMetaLM, we offer a new insight for designing language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Practical and Asymptotically Exact Conditional Sampling in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17775v2)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been successful on a range of conditional generation tasks including molecular design and text-to-image generation. However, these achievements have primarily depended on task-specific conditional training or error-prone heuristic approximations. Ideally, a conditional generation method should provide exact samples for a broad range of conditional distributions without requiring task-specific training. To this end, we introduce the Twisted Diffusion Sampler, or TDS. TDS is a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that targets the conditional distributions of diffusion models through simulating a set of weighted particles. The main idea is to use twisting, an SMC technique that enjoys good computational efficiency, to incorporate heuristic approximations without compromising asymptotic exactness. We first find in simulation and in conditional image generation tasks that TDS provides a computational statistical trade-off, yielding more accurate approximations with many particles but with empirical improvements over heuristics with as few as two particles. We then turn to motif-scaffolding, a core task in protein design, using a TDS extension to Riemannian diffusion models. On benchmark test cases, TDS allows flexible conditioning criteria and often outperforms the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/blt2114/twisted_diffusion_sampler</p></details> |

Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods often overlook structural information. However, feature engineering-based methods usually merely focus on binding affinity prediction without substantial molecular modification. To address this, we present Graph-based Topological Reinforcement Learning (GraphTRL), which integrates both chemical and structural data for improved molecular generation. GraphTRL leverages multiscale weighted colored graphs (MWCG) and persistent homology, combined with molecular fingerprints, as the state space for RL. Evaluations show that GraphTRL outperforms existing methods in binding affinity prediction, offering a promising approach to accelerate drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolReFlect: Towards In-Context Fine-grained Alignments between Molecules and Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14721v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecule discovery is a pivotal research field, impacting everything from the medicines we take to the materials we use. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in molecule understanding and generation, yet the alignments between molecules and their corresponding captions remain a significant challenge. Previous endeavours often treat the molecule as a general SMILES string or molecular graph, neglecting the fine-grained alignments between the molecular sub-structures and the descriptive textual phrases, which are crucial for accurate and explainable predictions. In this case, we introduce MolReFlect, a novel teacher-student framework designed to contextually perform the molecule-caption alignments in a fine-grained way. Our approach initially leverages a larger teacher LLM to label the detailed alignments by directly extracting critical phrases from molecule captions or SMILES strings and implying them to corresponding sub-structures or characteristics. To refine these alignments, we propose In-Context Selective Reflection, which retrieves previous extraction results as context examples for teacher LLM to reflect and lets a smaller student LLM select from in-context reflection and previous extraction results. Finally, we enhance the learning process of the student LLM through Chain-of-Thought In-Context Molecule Tuning, integrating the fine-grained alignments and the reasoning processes within the Chain-of-Thought format. Our experimental results demonstrate that MolReFlect enables LLMs like Mistral-7B to significantly outperform the previous baselines, achieving SOTA performance on the ChEBI-20 dataset. This advancement not only enhances the generative capabilities of LLMs in the molecule-caption translation task, but also contributes to a more explainable framework.</p></details> | 22 pages, 12 figures |

Recently, ligand-based virtual screening has garnered significant attention due to its efficacy in conducting extensive database screenings without relying on specific protein-binding site information. Obtaining binding affinity data for complexes is highly expensive, resulting in a limited amount of available data that covers a relatively small chemical space. Moreover, these datasets contain a significant amount of inconsistent noise. It is challenging to identify an inductive bias that consistently maintains the integrity of molecular activity during data augmentation. To tackle these challenges, we propose S-MolSearch, the first framework to our knowledge, that leverages molecular 3D information and affinity information in semi-supervised contrastive learning for ligand-based virtual screening. Drawing on the principles of inverse optimal transport, S-MolSearch efficiently processes both labeled and unlabeled data, training molecular structural encoders while generating soft labels for the unlabeled data. This design allows S-MolSearch to adaptively utilize unlabeled data within the learning process. Empirically, S-MolSearch demonstrates superior performance on widely-used benchmarks LIT-PCBA and DUD-E. It surpasses both structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening methods for AUROC, BEDROC and EF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molecule Generation with Fragment Retrieval Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12078v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fragment-based drug discovery, in which molecular fragments are assembled into new molecules with desirable biochemical properties, has achieved great success. However, many fragment-based molecule generation methods show limited exploration beyond the existing fragments in the database as they only reassemble or slightly modify the given ones. To tackle this problem, we propose a new fragment-based molecule generation framework with retrieval augmentation, namely Fragment Retrieval-Augmented Generation (f-RAG). f-RAG is based on a pre-trained molecular generative model that proposes additional fragments from input fragments to complete and generate a new molecule. Given a fragment vocabulary, f-RAG retrieves two types of fragments: (1) hard fragments, which serve as building blocks that will be explicitly included in the newly generated molecule, and (2) soft fragments, which serve as reference to guide the generation of new fragments through a trainable fragment injection module. To extrapolate beyond the existing fragments, f-RAG updates the fragment vocabulary with generated fragments via an iterative refinement process which is further enhanced with post-hoc genetic fragment modification. f-RAG can achieve an improved exploration-exploitation trade-off by maintaining a pool of fragments and expanding it with novel and high-quality fragments through a strong generative prior.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

In this study, we introduce a neuroevolution potential (NEP), trained on a dataset generated from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, using the moment tensor potential (MTP) as a reference. The low root mean square errors (RMSEs) for total energy and atomic forces demonstrate the high accuracy and transferability of both the MTP and NEP. We further calculate the phonon density of states (DOS) and radial distribution function (RDF) using both machine learning potentials, comparing the results to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the MTP potential offers slightly higher accuracy, the NEP achieves a remarkable 41-fold increase in computational speed. These findings provide detailed microscopic insights into the dynamics and rapid Cu-ion diffusion, paving the way for future studies on Cu-based solid electrolytes and their applications in energy devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the mold: overcoming the time constraints of molecular dynamics on general-purpose hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10532v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been intimately linked to that of computing hardware. For decades following the creation of MD, simulations have improved with computing power along the three principal dimensions of accuracy, atom count (spatial scale), and duration (temporal scale). Since the mid-2000s, computer platforms have however failed to provide strong scaling for MD as scale-out CPU and GPU platforms that provide substantial increases to spatial scale do not lead to proportional increases in temporal scale. Important scientific problems therefore remained inaccessible to direct simulation, prompting the development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms that present significant complexity, accuracy, and efficiency challenges. While bespoke MD-only hardware solutions have provided a path to longer timescales for specific physical systems, their impact on the broader community has been mitigated by their limited adaptability to new methods and potentials. In this work, we show that a novel computing architecture, the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine, completely alters the scaling path by delivering unprecedentedly high simulation rates up to 1.144M steps/second for 200,000 atoms whose interactions are described by an Embedded Atom Method potential. This enables direct simulations of the evolution of materials using general-purpose programmable hardware over millisecond timescales, dramatically increasing the space of direct MD simulations that can be carried out.</p></details> |  |

Despite the popularity of probabilistic generative models, numerical experiments benchmarking their performance on molecular data are lacking. In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: Neural Spline Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) Neural Spline Flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) Conditional Flow Matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models appears the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib\textsubscript{9} peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope our taxonomy of probabilistic generative frameworks and numerical results may guide model selection for a wide range of molecular tasks.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, it does not extract key substructures from a single patient visit, resulting in the failure to identify medication molecules suitable for the current patient visit. To address the above limitations, we propose a bimodal molecular recommendation framework named BiMoRec, which introduces 3D molecular structures to obtain atomic 3D coordinates and edge indices, overcoming the inherent lack of high-dimensional molecular information in 2D molecular structures. To retain the fast training and prediction efficiency of the recommendation system, we use bimodal graph contrastive pretraining to maximize the mutual information between the two molecular modalities, achieving the fusion of 2D and 3D molecular graphs. Additionally, we designed a molecular multi-step enhancement mechanism to re-calibrate the molecular weights. Specifically, we employ a pre-training method that captures both 2D and 3D molecular structure representations, along with substructure representations, and leverages contrastive learning to extract mutual information. We then use the pre-trained encoder to generate molecular representations, enhancing them through a three-step process: intra-visit, molecular per-visit, and latest-visit. Finally, we apply temporal information aggregation to generate the final medication combinations. Our implementation on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

These models have been developed inheriting from the advances in natural language processing and computer vision, achieving ever greater results. However, generative molecular modelling has unique challenges that are often overlooked. Chemical validity, interpretability of the generation process and flexibility to variable molecular sizes are among some of the remaining challenges for generative models in computational materials design. In this work, we propose an autoregressive approach that decomposes molecular generation into a sequence of discrete and interpretable steps using molecular fragments as units, a 'molecular story'. Enforcing chemical rules in the stories guarantees the chemical validity of the generated molecules, the discrete sequential steps of a molecular story makes the process transparent improving interpretability, and the autoregressive nature of the approach allows the size of the molecule to be a decision of the model. We demonstrate the validity of the approach in a multi-target inverse design of electroactive organic compounds, focusing on the target properties of solubility, redox potential, and synthetic accessibility. Our results show that the model can effectively bias the generation distribution according to the prompted multi-target objective.</p></details> |  |

However, the molecular generation process with diffusion models involves multiple autoregressive steps over a finite time horizon, leading to exposure bias issues inherently. To address the exposure bias issue, we propose a training framework named GapDiff. The core idea of GapDiff is to utilize model-predicted conformations as ground truth probabilistically during training, aiming to mitigate the data distributional disparity between training and inference, thereby enhancing the affinity of generated molecules. We conduct experiments using a 3D molecular generation model on the CrossDocked2020 dataset, and the vina energy and diversity demonstrate the potency of our framework with superior affinity.

However, most existing machine learning methods for small molecule generation suffer from poor synthesizability of candidate compounds, making experimental validation difficult. In this paper we propose Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), an extension of the GFlowNet framework that operates directly in the space of chemical reactions, thereby allowing out-of-the-box synthesizability while maintaining comparable quality of generated candidates. We demonstrate that with the proposed set of reactions and building blocks, it is possible to obtain a search space of molecules orders of magnitude larger than existing screening libraries coupled with low cost of synthesis. We also show that the approach scales to very large fragment libraries, further increasing the number of potential molecules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across a range of oracle models, including pretrained proxy models and GPU-accelerated docking.</p></details> |  |

These models demonstrate strong performance on a range of tasks; however, there has been evidence of brittleness when applied to more niche or narrow domains where hallucinations or fluent but incorrect responses reduce performance. Given the complex nature of scientific domains, it is prudent to investigate the trade-offs of leveraging off-the-shelf versus more targeted foundation models for scientific domains. In this work, we examine the benefits of in-domain pre-training for a given scientific domain, chemistry, and compare these to open-source, off-the-shelf models with zero-shot and few-shot prompting. Our results show that not only do in-domain base models perform reasonably well on in-domain tasks in a zero-shot setting but that further adaptation using instruction fine-tuning yields impressive performance on chemistry-specific tasks such as named entity recognition and molecular formula generation.</p></details> |  |

The junction tree variational autoencoder (JTVAE) has been shown to be an efficient generative model that can be used for suggesting legitimate novel drug-like small molecules with improved properties. While the performance of the generative molecular design (GMD) scheme strongly depends on the initial training data, one can improve its sampling efficiency for suggesting better molecules with enhanced properties by optimizing the latent space. In this work, we propose how mechanistic models - such as pathway models described by differential equations - can be used for effective latent space optimization(LSO) of JTVAEs and other similar models for GMD. To demonstrate the potential of our proposed approach, we show how a pharmacodynamic model, assessing the therapeutic efficacy of a drug-like small molecule by predicting how it modulates a cancer pathway, can be incorporated for effective LSO of data-driven models for GMD.</p></details> |  |

Active learning, which uses biased or unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) to generate candidate pools, aims to address this objective. Existing biased and unbiased MD-simulation methods, however, are prone to miss either rare events or extrapolative regions -- areas of the configurational space where unreliable predictions are made. This work demonstrates that MD, when biased by the MLIP's energy uncertainty, simultaneously captures extrapolative regions and rare events, which is crucial for developing uniformly accurate MLIPs. Furthermore, exploiting automatic differentiation, we enhance bias-forces-driven MD with the concept of bias stress. We employ calibrated gradient-based uncertainties to yield MLIPs with similar or, sometimes, better accuracy than ensemble-based methods at a lower computational cost. Finally, we apply uncertainty-biased MD to alanine dipeptide and MIL-53(Al), generating MLIPs that represent both configurational spaces more accurately than models trained with conventional MD.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Time-Aware Conditional Synthesis (TACS), a novel approach to conditional generation on diffusion models. It integrates adaptively controlled plug-and-play "online" guidance into a diffusion model, driving samples toward the desired properties while maintaining validity and stability. A key component of our algorithm is our new type of diffusion sampler, Time Correction Sampler (TCS), which is used to control guidance and ensure that the generated molecules remain on the correct manifold at each reverse step of the diffusion process at the same time. Our proposed method demonstrates significant performance in conditional 3D molecular generation and offers a promising approach towards inverse molecular design, potentially facilitating advancements in drug discovery, materials science, and other related fields.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Thus, we propose LLaMo: Large Language Model-based Molecular graph assistant, which is an end-to-end trained large molecular graph-language model. To bridge the discrepancy between the language and graph modalities, we present the multi-level graph projector that transforms graph representations into graph tokens by abstracting the output representations of each GNN layer and motif representations with the cross-attention mechanism. We also introduce machine-generated molecular graph instruction data to instruction-tune the large molecular graph-language model for general-purpose molecule and language understanding. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaMo shows the best performance on diverse tasks, such as molecular description generation, property prediction, and IUPAC name prediction.

| **[Fisher Flow Matching for Generative Modeling over Discrete Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14664v4)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling over discrete data has recently seen numerous success stories, with applications spanning language modeling, biological sequence design, and graph-structured molecular data. The predominant generative modeling paradigm for discrete data is still autoregressive, with more recent alternatives based on diffusion or flow-matching falling short of their impressive performance in continuous data settings, such as image or video generation. In this work, we introduce Fisher-Flow, a novel flow-matching model for discrete data. Fisher-Flow takes a manifestly geometric perspective by considering categorical distributions over discrete data as points residing on a statistical manifold equipped with its natural Riemannian metric: the $\textit{Fisher-Rao metric}$. As a result, we demonstrate discrete data itself can be continuously reparameterised to points on the positive orthant of the $d$-hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^d_+$, which allows us to define flows that map any source distribution to target in a principled manner by transporting mass along (closed-form) geodesics of $\mathbb{S}^d_+$. Furthermore, the learned flows in Fisher-Flow can be further bootstrapped by leveraging Riemannian optimal transport leading to improved training dynamics. We prove that the gradient flow induced by Fisher-Flow is optimal in reducing the forward KL divergence. We evaluate Fisher-Flow on an array of synthetic and diverse real-world benchmarks, including designing DNA Promoter, and DNA Enhancer sequences. Empirically, we find that Fisher-Flow improves over prior diffusion and flow-matching models on these benchmarks.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[ET-Flow: Equivariant Flow-Matching for Molecular Conformer Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22388v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting low-energy molecular conformations given a molecular graph is an important but challenging task in computational drug discovery. Existing state-of-the-art approaches either resort to large scale transformer-based models that diffuse over conformer fields, or use computationally expensive methods to generate initial structures and diffuse over torsion angles. In this work, we introduce Equivariant Transformer Flow (ET-Flow). We showcase that a well-designed flow matching approach with equivariance and harmonic prior alleviates the need for complex internal geometry calculations and large architectures, contrary to the prevailing methods in the field. Our approach results in a straightforward and scalable method that directly operates on all-atom coordinates with minimal assumptions. With the advantages of equivariance and flow matching, ET-Flow significantly increases the precision and physical validity of the generated conformers, while being a lighter model and faster at inference.

| **[Pessimistic Backward Policy for GFlowNets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16012v3)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), which learn to sample objects proportionally to a given reward function through the trajectory of state transitions. In this work, we observe that GFlowNets tend to under-exploit the high-reward objects due to training on insufficient number of trajectories, which may lead to a large gap between the estimated flow and the (known) reward value. In response to this challenge, we propose a pessimistic backward policy for GFlowNets (PBP-GFN), which maximizes the observed flow to align closely with the true reward for the object. We extensively evaluate PBP-GFN across eight benchmarks, including hyper-grid environment, bag generation, structured set generation, molecular generation, and four RNA sequence generation tasks. In particular, PBP-GFN enhances the discovery of high-reward objects, maintains the diversity of the objects, and consistently outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Blurring Diffusion for Hierarchical Molecular Conformer Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20255v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can diffusion models process 3D geometries in a coarse-to-fine manner, akin to our multiscale view of the world? In this paper, we address the question by focusing on a fundamental biochemical problem of generating 3D molecular conformers conditioned on molecular graphs in a multiscale manner. Our approach consists of two hierarchical stages: i) generation of coarse-grained fragment-level 3D structure from the molecular graph, and ii) generation of fine atomic details from the coarse-grained approximated structure while allowing the latter to be adjusted simultaneously. For the challenging second stage, which demands preserving coarse-grained information while ensuring SE(3) equivariance, we introduce a novel generative model termed Equivariant Blurring Diffusion (EBD), which defines a forward process that moves towards the fragment-level coarse-grained structure by blurring the fine atomic details of conformers, and a reverse process that performs the opposite operation using equivariant networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EBD by geometric and chemical comparison to state-of-the-art denoising diffusion models on a benchmark of drug-like molecules. Ablation studies draw insights on the design of EBD by thoroughly analyzing its architecture, which includes the design of the loss function and the data corruption process. Codes are released at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/EBD .</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

To address this, the Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) representation was recently introduced as an alternative that streamlines those tasks. In this study, we investigate the optimal setups for training SAFE generative models, focusing on dataset size, data augmentation through randomization, model architecture, and bond disconnection algorithms. We found that larger, more diverse datasets improve performance, with the LLaMA architecture using Rotary Positional Embedding proving most robust. SAFE-based models also consistently outperform SMILES-based approaches in scaffold decoration and linker design, particularly with BRICS decomposition yielding the best results. These insights highlight key factors that significantly impact the efficacy of SAFE-based generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chemical Language Model Linker: blending text and molecules with modular adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20182v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models and multi-modal models has enabled the appealing idea of generating novel molecules from text descriptions. Generative modeling would shift the paradigm from relying on large-scale chemical screening to find molecules with desired properties to directly generating those molecules. However, multi-modal models combining text and molecules are often trained from scratch, without leveraging existing high-quality pretrained models. That approach consumes more computational resources and prohibits model scaling. In contrast, we propose a lightweight adapter-based strategy named Chemical Language Model Linker (ChemLML). ChemLML blends the two single domain models and obtains conditional molecular generation from text descriptions while still operating in the specialized embedding spaces of the molecular domain. ChemLML can tailor diverse pretrained text models for molecule generation by training relatively few adapter parameters. We find that the choice of molecular representation used within ChemLML, SMILES versus SELFIES, has a strong influence on conditional molecular generation performance. SMILES is often preferable despite not guaranteeing valid molecules. We raise issues in using the large PubChem dataset of molecules and their associated descriptions for evaluating molecule generation and provide a filtered version of the dataset as a generation test set. To demonstrate how ChemLML could be used in practice, we generate candidate protein inhibitors and use docking to assess their quality.</p></details> | 25 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Generative Design of Functional Metal Complexes Utilizing the Internal Knowledge of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18136v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing functional transition metal complexes (TMCs) faces challenges due to the vast search space of metals and ligands, requiring efficient optimization strategies. Traditional genetic algorithms (GAs) are commonly used, employing random mutations and crossovers driven by explicit mathematical objectives to explore this space. Transferring knowledge between different GA tasks, however, is difficult. We integrate large language models (LLMs) into the evolutionary optimization framework (LLM-EO) and apply it in both single- and multi-objective optimization for TMCs. We find that LLM-EO surpasses traditional GAs by leveraging the chemical knowledge of LLMs gained during their extensive pretraining. Remarkably, without supervised fine-tuning, LLMs utilize the full historical data from optimization processes, outperforming those focusing only on top-performing TMCs. LLM-EO successfully identifies eight of the top-20 TMCs with the largest HOMO-LUMO gaps by proposing only 200 candidates out of a 1.37 million TMCs space. Through prompt engineering using natural language, LLM-EO introduces unparalleled flexibility into multi-objective optimizations, thereby circumventing the necessity for intricate mathematical formulations. As generative models, LLMs can suggest new ligands and TMCs with unique properties by merging both internal knowledge and external chemistry data, thus combining the benefits of efficient optimization and molecular generation. With increasing potential of LLMs as pretrained foundational models and new post-training inference strategies, we foresee broad applications of LLM-based evolutionary optimization in chemistry and materials design.</p></details> |  |

Such virtual screening depends in part on methods to predict the binding affinity between ligands and proteins. Many computational models for binding affinity prediction have been developed, but with varying results across targets. Given that ensembling or meta-modeling approaches have shown great promise in reducing model-specific biases, we develop a framework to integrate published force-field-based empirical docking and sequence-based deep learning models. In building this framework, we evaluate many combinations of individual base models, training databases, and several meta-modeling approaches. We show that many of our meta-models significantly improve affinity predictions over base models. Our best meta-models achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art deep learning tools exclusively based on 3D structures, while allowing for improved database scalability and flexibility through the explicit inclusion of features such as physicochemical properties or molecular descriptors. We further demonstrate improved generalization capability by our models using a large-scale benchmark of affinity prediction as well as a virtual screening application benchmark. Overall, we demonstrate that diverse modeling approaches can be ensembled together to gain meaningful improvement in binding affinity prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 6 main tables, 6 main figures, 8 supplementary figures, and supporting information.

Current techniques for sampling ensembles are computationally inefficient, or do not transfer to systems outside their training data. We present walk-Jump Accelerated Molecular ensembles with Universal Noise (JAMUN), a step towards the goal of efficiently sampling the Boltzmann distribution of arbitrary proteins. By extending Walk-Jump Sampling to point clouds, JAMUN enables ensemble generation at orders of magnitude faster rates than traditional molecular dynamics or state-of-the-art ML methods. Further, JAMUN is able to predict the stable basins of small peptides that were not seen during training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Guided Multi-Property Molecular Optimization with a Diffusion Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13597v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization (MO) is a crucial stage in drug discovery in which task-oriented generated molecules are optimized to meet practical industrial requirements. Existing mainstream MO approaches primarily utilize external property predictors to guide iterative property optimization. However, learning all molecular samples in the vast chemical space is unrealistic for predictors. As a result, errors and noise are inevitably introduced during property prediction due to the nature of approximation. This leads to discrepancy accumulation, generalization reduction and suboptimal molecular candidates. In this paper, we propose a text-guided multi-property molecular optimization method utilizing transformer-based diffusion language model (TransDLM). TransDLM leverages standardized chemical nomenclature as semantic representations of molecules and implicitly embeds property requirements into textual descriptions, thereby preventing error propagation during diffusion process. Guided by physically and chemically detailed textual descriptions, TransDLM samples and optimizes encoded source molecules, retaining core scaffolds of source molecules and ensuring structural similarities. Moreover, TransDLM enables simultaneous sampling of multiple molecules, making it ideal for scalable, efficient large-scale optimization through distributed computation on web platforms. Furthermore, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in optimizing molecular structural similarity and enhancing chemical properties on the benchmark dataset.

However, while performing well at capturing distributions of molecular motifs, they often produce synthetically inaccessible molecules. To address this, we introduce SynFlowNet, a GFlowNet model whose action space uses chemical reactions and buyable reactants to sequentially build new molecules. By incorporating forward synthesis as an explicit constraint of the generative mechanism, we aim at bridging the gap between in silico molecular generation and real world synthesis capabilities. We evaluate our approach using synthetic accessibility scores and an independent retrosynthesis tool to assess the synthesizability of our compounds, and motivate the choice of GFlowNets through considerable improvement in sample diversity compared to baselines. Additionally, we identify challenges with reaction encodings that can complicate traversal of the MDP in the backward direction. To address this, we introduce various strategies for learning the GFlowNet backward policy and thus demonstrate how additional constraints can be integrated into the GFlowNet MDP framework. This approach enables our model to successfully identify synthesis pathways for previously unseen molecules.</p></details> |  |

In particular, designing molecules satisfying multi-parameter optimization objectives, while simultaneously being synthesizable and enforcing the presence of specific commercial building blocks in the synthesis. This is practically important for molecule re-purposing, sustainability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel reward function called TANimoto Group Overlap (TANGO), which uses chemistry principles to transform a sparse reward function into a dense and learnable reward function -- crucial for reinforcement learning. TANGO can augment general-purpose molecular generative models to directly optimize for constrained synthesizability while simultaneously optimizing for other properties relevant to drug discovery using reinforcement learning. Our framework is general and addresses starting-material, intermediate, and divergent synthesis constraints. Contrary to most existing works in the field, we show that incentivizing a general-purpose (without any inductive biases) model is a productive approach to navigating challenging optimization scenarios. We demonstrate this by showing that the trained models explicitly learn a desirable distribution. Our framework is the first generative approach to tackle constrained synthesizability.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we expand upon KANO by integrating the large-scale ChEBI knowledge graph, which includes 2,840 functional groups -- significantly more than the original 82 used in KANO. We explore two approaches, Replace and Integrate, to incorporate this extensive knowledge into the KANO framework. Our results demonstrate that including ChEBI leads to improved performance on 9 out of 14 molecular property prediction datasets.

Traditionally, watermarking techniques have been developed primarily for rich information media such as images and audio. However, these methods have not been adequately adapted for graph-based data, particularly molecular graphs. Latent 3D graph diffusion(LDM-3DG) is an ascendant approach in the molecular graph generation field. This model effectively manages the complexities of molecular structures, preserving essential symmetries and topological features. We adapt the Gaussian Shading, a proven performance lossless watermarking technique, to the latent graph diffusion domain to protect this sophisticated new technology. Our adaptation simplifies the watermark diffusion process through duplication and padding, making it adaptable and suitable for various message types. We conduct several experiments using the LDM-3DG model on publicly available datasets QM9 and Drugs, to assess the robustness and effectiveness of our technique. Our results demonstrate that the watermarked molecules maintain statistical parity in 9 out of 10 performance metrics compared to the original. Moreover, they exhibit a 100% detection rate and a 99% extraction rate in a 2D decoded pipeline, while also showing robustness against post-editing attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models mostly work with SMILES and SELFIES chemical string representations, which lack spatial features vital for drug discovery. Additionally, attempts to translate chemical 3D structures into text format encounter issues such as excessive length and insufficient atom connectivity information. To address these issues, we introduce nach0-pc, a model combining domain-specific encoder and textual representation to handle spatial arrangement of atoms effectively. Our approach utilizes a molecular point cloud encoder for concise and order-invariant structure representation. We introduce a novel pre-training scheme for molecular point clouds to distillate the knowledge from spatial molecular structures datasets. After fine-tuning within both single-task and multi-task frameworks, nach0-pc demonstrates performance comparable with other diffusion models in terms of generated samples quality across several established spatial molecular generation tasks. Notably, our model is a multi-task approach, in contrast to diffusion models being limited to single tasks. Additionally, it is capable of processing point cloud-related data, which language models are not capable of handling due to memory limitations. These lead to our model having reduced training and inference time while maintaining on par performance.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce a multi-constraint molecular generation large language model, TSMMG, which, akin to a student, incorporates knowledge from various small models and tools, namely, the 'teachers'. To train TSMMG, we construct a large set of text-molecule pairs by extracting molecular knowledge from these 'teachers', enabling it to generate novel molecules that conform to the descriptions through various text prompts. We experimentally show that TSMMG remarkably performs in generating molecules meeting complex, natural language-described property requirements across two-, three-, and four-constraint tasks, with an average molecular validity of over 99% and success ratio of 82.58%, 68.03%, and 67.48%, respectively. The model also exhibits adaptability through zero-shot testing, creating molecules that satisfy combinations of properties that have not been encountered. It can comprehend text inputs with various language styles, extending beyond the confines of outlined prompts, as confirmed through empirical validation. Additionally, the knowledge distillation feature of TSMMG contributes to the continuous enhancement of small models, while the innovative approach to dataset construction effectively addresses the issues of data scarcity and quality, which positions TSMMG as a promising tool in the domains of drug discovery and materials science.</p></details> | 37 pages, 10 figures |

The packing structure of these materials plays a crucial role in determining their electronic and transport properties, which are key to enhancing the efficiency of devices like organic solar cells (OSCs). However, obtaining these optoelectronic properties computationally requires molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to generate a conformational ensemble, a process that can be computationally expensive due to the large system sizes involved. Recent advances have focused on using generative models, particularly flow-based models as Boltzmann generators, to improve the efficiency of MD sampling. In this work, we developed a dual-scale flow matching method that separates training and inference into coarse-grained and all-atom stages and enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of standard flow matching samplers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a dataset of Y6 molecular clusters obtained through MD simulations, and we benchmark its efficiency and accuracy against single-scale flow matching methods.</p></details> |  |

While CB guidance may work to generate molecular-like graphs, we hint at the fact that its assumptions apply poorly to the chemical domain. Based on this insight we propose a classifier-free DiGress (FreeGress), which works by directly injecting the conditioning information into the training process. CF guidance is convenient given its less stringent assumptions and since it does not require to train an auxiliary property regressor, thus halving the number of trainable parameters in the model. We empirically show that our model yields up to 79% improvement in Mean Absolute Error with respect to DiGress on property targeting tasks on QM9 and ZINC-250k benchmarks. As an additional contribution, we propose a simple yet powerful approach to improve chemical validity of generated samples, based on the observation that certain chemical properties such as molecular weight correlate with the number of atoms in molecules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ECML PKDD 2024</p></details> |
| **[When Molecular GAN Meets Byte-Pair Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19740v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), are pivotal in discovering novel drug-like candidates via de novo molecular generation. However, traditional character-wise tokenizers often struggle with identifying novel and complex sub-structures in molecular data. In contrast, alternative tokenization methods have demonstrated superior performance. This study introduces a molecular GAN that integrates a byte level byte-pair encoding tokenizer and employs reinforcement learning to enhance de novo molecular generation. Specifically, the generator functions as an actor, producing SMILES strings, while the discriminator acts as a critic, evaluating their quality. Our molecular GAN also integrates innovative reward mechanisms aimed at improving computational efficiency. Experimental results assessing validity, uniqueness, novelty, and diversity, complemented by detailed visualization analysis, robustly demonstrate the effectiveness of our GAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling of Molecular Dynamics Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17808v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful technique for studying microscopic phenomena, but its computational cost has driven significant interest in the development of deep learning-based surrogate models. We introduce generative modeling of molecular trajectories as a paradigm for learning flexible multi-task surrogate models of MD from data. By conditioning on appropriately chosen frames of the trajectory, we show such generative models can be adapted to diverse tasks such as forward simulation, transition path sampling, and trajectory upsampling. By alternatively conditioning on part of the molecular system and inpainting the rest, we also demonstrate the first steps towards dynamics-conditioned molecular design. We validate the full set of these capabilities on tetrapeptide simulations and show that our model can produce reasonable ensembles of protein monomers. Altogether, our work illustrates how generative modeling can unlock value from MD data towards diverse downstream tasks that are not straightforward to address with existing methods or even MD itself.

The use of a discriminator to guide a diffusion process has previously been used for continuous diffusion models, and in this work we derive ways of using a discriminator together with a pretrained generative model in the discrete case. First, we show that using an optimal discriminator will correct the pretrained model and enable exact sampling from the underlying data distribution. Second, to account for the realistic scenario of using a sub-optimal discriminator, we derive a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm which iteratively takes the predictions from the discriminator into account during the generation process. We test these approaches on the task of generating molecular graphs and show how the discriminator improves the generative performance over using only the pretrained model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AISTATS 2024, official proceedings available at https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/ekstrom-kelvinius24a.html.

| **[Mitigating Exposure Bias in Score-Based Generation of Molecular Conformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14014v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular conformation generation poses a significant challenge in the field of computational chemistry. Recently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) are effectively used due to their capacity for generating accurate conformations far beyond conventional physics-based approaches. However, the discrepancy between training and inference rises a critical problem known as the exposure bias. While this issue has been extensively investigated in DPMs, the existence of exposure bias in SGMs and its effective measurement remain unsolved, which hinders the use of compensation methods for SGMs, including ConfGF and Torsional Diffusion as the representatives. In this work, we first propose a method for measuring exposure bias in SGMs used for molecular conformation generation, which confirms the significant existence of exposure bias in these models and measures its value. We design a new compensation algorithm Input Perturbation (IP), which is adapted from a method originally designed for DPMs only. Experimental results show that by introducing IP, SGM-based molecular conformation models can significantly improve both the accuracy and diversity of the generated conformations. Especially by using the IP-enhanced Torsional Diffusion model, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the GEOM-Drugs dataset and are on par on GEOM-QM9. We provide the code publicly at https://github.com/jia-975/torsionalDiff-ip.</p></details> | SMC 2024 |

Existing autoregressive models such as G-SchNet and G-SphereNet for molecules utilize rotationally invariant features to respect the 3D symmetries of molecules. In contrast, Symphony uses message-passing with higher-degree $E(3)$-equivariant features. This allows a novel representation of probability distributions via spherical harmonic signals to efficiently model the 3D geometry of molecules. We show that Symphony is able to accurately generate small molecules from the QM9 dataset, outperforming existing autoregressive models and approaching the performance of diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Despite these advances, several fundamental questions remain unanswered as the field increasingly focuses on more complex generative models and sophisticated molecular representations as an answer to the challenges of drug design. In this paper, we return to the simplest representation of molecules, and investigate overlooked limitations of classical generative approaches, particularly Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and auto-regressive models. We propose a hybrid model in the form of a novel regularizer that leverages the strengths of both to improve validity, conditional generation, and style transfer of molecular sequences. Additionally, we provide an in depth discussion of overlooked assumptions of these models' behaviour.</p></details> |  |
| **[A DNN Biophysics Model with Topological and Electrostatic Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03658v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this project, we provide a deep-learning neural network (DNN) based biophysics model to predict protein properties. The model uses multi-scale and uniform topological and electrostatic features generated with protein structural information and force field, which governs the molecular mechanics. The topological features are generated using the element specified persistent homology (ESPH) while the electrostatic features are fast computed using a Cartesian treecode. These features are uniform in number for proteins with various sizes thus the broadly available protein structure database can be used in training the network. These features are also multi-scale thus the resolution and computational cost can be balanced by the users. The machine learning simulation on over 4000 protein structures shows the efficiency and fidelity of these features in representing the protein structure and force field for the predication of their biophysical properties such as electrostatic solvation energy. Tests on topological or electrostatic features alone and the combination of both showed the optimal performance when both features are used. This model shows its potential as a general tool in assisting biophysical properties and function prediction for the broad biomolecules using data from both theoretical computing and experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Efficiency: Molecular Data Pruning for Enhanced Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01081v1)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of various molecular tasks and massive datasets, how to perform efficient training has become an urgent yet under-explored issue in the area. Data pruning (DP), as an oft-stated approach to saving training burdens, filters out less influential samples to form a coreset for training. However, the increasing reliance on pretrained models for molecular tasks renders traditional in-domain DP methods incompatible. Therefore, we propose a Molecular data Pruning framework for enhanced Generalization (MolPeg), which focuses on the source-free data pruning scenario, where data pruning is applied with pretrained models. By maintaining two models with different updating paces during training, we introduce a novel scoring function to measure the informativeness of samples based on the loss discrepancy. As a plug-and-play framework, MolPeg realizes the perception of both source and target domain and consistently outperforms existing DP methods across four downstream tasks. Remarkably, it can surpass the performance obtained from full-dataset training, even when pruning up to 60-70% of the data on HIV and PCBA dataset. Our work suggests that the discovery of effective data-pruning metrics could provide a viable path to both enhanced efficiency and superior generalization in transfer learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, under review</p></details> |

In this work, we provide a simple algorithm that relies on perturbation experiments on latent codes of a pre-trained generative autoencoder to uncover an attribute graph that is implied by the generative model. We perform perturbation experiments to check for influence of a given latent variable on a subset of attributes. Given this, we show that one can fit an effective graphical model that models a structural equation model between latent codes taken as exogenous variables and attributes taken as observed variables. One interesting aspect is that a single latent variable controls multiple overlapping subsets of attributes unlike conventional approaches that try to impose full independence. Using a pre-trained generative autoencoder trained on a large dataset of small molecules, we demonstrate that the graphical model between various molecular attributes and latent codes learned by our algorithm can be used to predict a specific property for molecules which are drawn from a different distribution. We compare prediction models trained on various feature subsets chosen by simple baselines, as well as existing causal discovery and sparse learning/feature selection methods, with the ones in the derived Markov blanket from our method. Results show empirically that the predictor that relies on our Markov blanket attributes is robust to distribution shifts when transferred or fine-tuned with a few samples from the new distribution, especially when training data is limited.</p></details> | <details><summary>New e...</summary><p>New experiments; reframed contributions</p></details> |

Although tokenization of molecular graphs exists, that for 3D geometries is largely unexplored. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by proposing the Geo2Seq, which converts molecular geometries into $SE(3)$-invariant 1D discrete sequences. Geo2Seq consists of canonical labeling and invariant spherical representation steps, which together maintain geometric and atomic fidelity in a format conducive to LMs. Our experiments show that, when coupled with Geo2Seq, various LMs excel in molecular geometry generation, especially in controlled generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Integrating graph generation with these instructions is complex, leading most current methods to use molecular sequences with pre-trained large language models. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework, named $\textbf{UTGDiff (Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model)}$, which utilizes language models for discrete graph diffusion to generate molecular graphs from instructions. UTGDiff features a unified text-graph transformer as the denoising network, derived from pre-trained language models and minimally modified to process graph data through attention bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that UTGDiff consistently outperforms sequence-based baselines in tasks involving instruction-based molecule generation and editing, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters given an equivalent level of pretraining corpus.

| **[Experimental Characterization of Hydrodynamic Gating-Based Molecular Communication Transmitter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09835v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular communication (MC) is a bio-inspired method of transmitting information using biochemical signals, promising for novel medical, agricultural, and environmental applications at the intersection of bio-, nano-, and communication technologies. Developing reliable MC systems for high-rate information transfer remains challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of application environments and the physical and resource limitations of micro/nanoscale transmitters and receivers. Microfluidics can help overcome many such practical challenges by enabling testbeds that can replicate the application media with precise control over flow conditions. However, existing microfluidic MC testbeds face significant limitations in chemical signal generation with programmable signal waveforms, e.g., in terms of pulse width. To tackle this, we previously proposed a practical microfluidic MC transmitter architecture based on the hydrodynamic gating technique, a prevalent chemical waveform generation method. This paper reports the experimental validation and characterization of this method, examining its precision in terms of spatiotemporal control on the generated molecular concentration pulses. We detail the fabrication of the transmitter, its working mechanism and discuss its potential limitations based on empirical data. We show that the microfluidic transmitter is capable of providing precise, programmable, and reproducible molecular concentration pulses, which would facilitate the experimental research in MC.</p></details> |  |

However, most current applications of LLMs in drug discovery lack the ability to comprehend three-dimensional (3D) structures, thereby limiting their effectiveness in tasks that explicitly involve molecular conformations. In this study, we introduced Token-Mol, a token-only 3D drug design model. This model encodes all molecular information, including 2D and 3D structures, as well as molecular property data, into tokens, which transforms classification and regression tasks in drug discovery into probabilistic prediction problems, thereby enabling learning through a unified paradigm. Token-Mol is built on the transformer decoder architecture and trained using random causal masking techniques. Additionally, we proposed the Gaussian cross-entropy (GCE) loss function to overcome the challenges in regression tasks, significantly enhancing the capacity of LLMs to learn continuous numerical values. Through a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), Token-Mol achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing task-specific methods across various downstream tasks, including pocket-based molecular generation, conformation generation, and molecular property prediction. Compared to existing molecular pre-trained models, Token-Mol exhibits superior proficiency in handling a wider range of downstream tasks essential for drug design. Notably, our approach improves regression task accuracy by approximately 30% compared to similar token-only methods. Token-Mol overcomes the precision limitations of token-only models and has the potential to integrate seamlessly with general models such as ChatGPT, paving the way for the development of a universal artificial intelligence drug design model that facilitates rapid and high-quality drug design by experts.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fragment-Masked Molecular Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09106v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, aimed at refining molecular structures to enhance drug efficacy and minimize side effects, ultimately accelerating the overall drug development process. Many target-based molecular optimization methods have been proposed, significantly advancing drug discovery. These methods primarily on understanding the specific drug target structures or their hypothesized roles in combating diseases. However, challenges such as a limited number of available targets and a difficulty capturing clear structures hinder innovative drug development. In contrast, phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) does not depend on clear target structures and can identify hits with novel and unbiased polypharmacology signatures. As a result, PDD-based molecular optimization can reduce potential safety risks while optimizing phenotypic activity, thereby increasing the likelihood of clinical success. Therefore, we propose a fragment-masked molecular optimization method based on PDD (FMOP). FMOP employs a regression-free diffusion model to conditionally optimize the molecular masked regions without training, effectively generating new molecules with similar scaffolds. On the large-scale drug response dataset GDSCv2, we optimize the potential molecules across all 945 cell lines. The overall experiments demonstrate that the in-silico optimization success rate reaches 94.4%, with an average efficacy increase of 5.3%. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation and visualization experiments, confirming that FMOP is an effective and robust molecular optimization method.

Unlike their counterpart property predictors in typical molecular design frameworks, generative molecular design models have seen fewer efforts on uncertainty quantification (UQ) due to computational challenges in Bayesian inference posed by their large number of parameters. In this work, we focus on the junction-tree variational autoencoder (JT-VAE), a popular model for generative molecular design, and address this issue by leveraging the low dimensional active subspace to capture the uncertainty in the model parameters. Specifically, we approximate the posterior distribution over the active subspace parameters to estimate the epistemic model uncertainty in an extremely high dimensional parameter space. The proposed UQ scheme does not require alteration of the model architecture, making it readily applicable to any pre-trained model. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the AS-based UQ and its potential impact on molecular optimization by exploring the model diversity under epistemic uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

When combined with deep learning techniques to predict and represent molecular-phenotype interactions, these advancements hold the potential to significantly accelerate and enhance drug discovery applications. This work focuses on the novel task of HCI-guided molecular design. Generative models for molecule design could be guided by HCI data, for example with a supervised model that links molecules to phenotypes of interest as a reward function. However, limited labeled data, combined with the high-dimensional readouts, can make training these methods challenging and impractical. We consider an alternative approach in which we leverage an unsupervised multimodal joint embedding to define a latent similarity as a reward for GFlowNets. The proposed model learns to generate new molecules that could produce phenotypic effects similar to those of the given image target, without relying on pre-annotated phenotypic labels. We demonstrate that the proposed method generates molecules with high morphological and structural similarity to the target, increasing the likelihood of similar biological activity, as confirmed by an independent oracle model.</p></details> |  |
| **[CardioGenAI: A Machine Learning-Based Framework for Re-Engineering Drugs for Reduced hERG Liability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07632v3)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The link between in vitro hERG ion channel inhibition and subsequent in vivo QT interval prolongation, a critical risk factor for the development of arrythmias such as Torsade de Pointes, is so well established that in vitro hERG activity alone is often sufficient to end the development of an otherwise promising drug candidate. It is therefore of tremendous interest to develop advanced methods for identifying hERG-active compounds in the early stages of drug development, as well as for proposing redesigned compounds with reduced hERG liability and preserved on-target potency. In this work, we present CardioGenAI, a machine learning-based framework for re-engineering both developmental and commercially available drugs for reduced hERG activity while preserving their pharmacological activity. The framework incorporates novel state-of-the-art discriminative models for predicting hERG channel activity, as well as activity against the voltage-gated NaV1.5 and CaV1.2 channels due to their potential implications in modulating the arrhythmogenic potential induced by hERG channel blockade. We applied the complete framework to pimozide, an FDA-approved antipsychotic agent that demonstrates high affinity to the hERG channel, and generated 100 refined candidates. Remarkably, among the candidates is fluspirilene, a compound which is of the same class of drugs (diphenylmethanes) as pimozide and therefore has similar pharmacological activity, yet exhibits over 700-fold weaker binding to hERG. We envision that this method can effectively be applied to developmental compounds exhibiting hERG liabilities to provide a means of rescuing drug development programs that have stalled due to hERG-related safety concerns. We have made all of our software open-source to facilitate integration of the CardioGenAI framework for molecular hypothesis generation into drug discovery workflows.</p></details> |  |

| **[DP-GPL: Differentially Private Graph Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10544v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in various applications. Recently, graph prompt learning has emerged as a powerful GNN training paradigm, inspired by advances in language and vision foundation models. Here, a GNN is pre-trained on public data and then adapted to sensitive tasks using lightweight graph prompts. However, using prompts from sensitive data poses privacy risks. In this work, we are the first to investigate these practical risks in graph prompts by instantiating a membership inference attack that reveals significant privacy leakage. We also find that the standard privacy method, DP-SGD, fails to provide practical privacy-utility trade-offs in graph prompt learning, likely due to the small number of sensitive data points used to learn the prompts. As a solution, we propose DP-GPL for differentially private graph prompt learning based on the PATE framework, that generates a graph prompt with differential privacy guarantees. Our evaluation across various graph prompt learning methods, GNN architectures, and pre-training strategies demonstrates that our algorithm achieves high utility at strong privacy, effectively mitigating privacy concerns while preserving the powerful capabilities of prompted GNNs as powerful foundation models in the graph domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Clifford Algebraic Approach to E(n)-Equivariant High-order Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04692v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing neural network architectures that can handle data symmetry is crucial. This is especially important for geometric graphs whose properties are equivariance under Euclidean transformations. Current equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs), particularly those using message passing, have a limitation in expressive power. Recent high-order graph neural networks can overcome this limitation, yet they lack equivariance properties, representing a notable drawback in certain applications in chemistry and physical sciences. In this paper, we introduce the Clifford Group Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (CG-EGNNs), a novel EGNN that enhances high-order message passing by integrating high-order local structures in the context of Clifford algebras. As a key benefit of using Clifford algebras, CG-EGNN can learn functions that capture equivariance from positional features. By adopting the high-order message passing mechanism, CG-EGNN gains richer information from neighbors, thus improving model performance. Furthermore, we establish the universality property of the $k$-hop message passing framework, showcasing greater expressive power of CG-EGNNs with additional $k$-hop message passing mechanism. We empirically validate that CG-EGNNs outperform previous methods on various benchmarks including n-body, CMU motion capture, and MD17, highlighting their effectiveness in geometric deep learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Homogenization of Metamaterials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17365v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries.

| **[Uncertainty-Aware Robust Learning on Noisy Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08210v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have excelled in various graph learning tasks, particularly node classification. However, their performance is often hampered by noisy measurements in real-world graphs, which can corrupt critical patterns in the data. To address this, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware graph learning framework inspired by distributionally robust optimization. Specifically, we use a graph neural network-based encoder to embed the node features and find the optimal node embeddings by minimizing the worst-case risk through a minimax formulation. Such an uncertainty-aware learning process leads to improved node representations and a more robust graph predictive model that effectively mitigates the impact of uncertainty arising from data noise. Our experimental results demonstrate superior predictive performance over baselines across noisy scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2025 camera ready</p></details> |

Neural network-based approaches, such as convolutional and graph neural networks, have partially alleviated this burden by enabling efficient local feature extraction. However, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies due to limited receptive fields, and Transformer-based models, while providing global context, incur prohibitive computational costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose AMR-Transformer, an efficient and accurate neural CFD-solving pipeline that integrates a novel adaptive mesh refinement scheme with a Navier-Stokes constraint-aware fast pruning module. This design encourages long-range interactions between simulation cells and facilitates the modeling of global fluid wave patterns, such as turbulence and shockwaves. Experiments show that our approach achieves significant gains in efficiency while preserving critical details, making it suitable for high-resolution physical simulations with long-range dependencies. On CFDBench, PDEBench and a new shockwave dataset, our pipeline demonstrates up to an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy over baseline models. Additionally, compared to ViT, our approach achieves a reduction in FLOPs of up to 60 times.</p></details> |  |

This study identifies this limitation and introduces a reachability-based graph transformation to densify topological connections, reducing resistance distances. Empirical tests show transformed-GNNs outperform EA-LSTM in extreme flood prediction, achieving 24-h water level accuracy equivalent to EA-LSTM's 14-h forecasts - a 71% improvement in long-term predictive horizon. The dense graph retains flow dynamics across hierarchical river branches, enabling GNNs to capture distal node interactions critical for rare flood events. This topological innovation bridges the gap between river network structure and GNN modeling, offering a scalable framework for early warning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planning with Adaptive World Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10714v3)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning is crucial for safe navigation in complex urban environments. Historically, motion planners (MPs) have been evaluated with procedurally-generated simulators like CARLA. However, such synthetic benchmarks do not capture real-world multi-agent interactions. nuPlan, a recently released MP benchmark, addresses this limitation by augmenting real-world driving logs with closed-loop simulation logic, effectively turning the fixed dataset into a reactive simulator. We analyze the characteristics of nuPlan's recorded logs and find that each city has its own unique driving behaviors, suggesting that robust planners must adapt to different environments. We learn to model such unique behaviors with BehaviorNet, a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) that predicts reactive agent behaviors using features derived from recently-observed agent histories; intuitively, some aggressive agents may tailgate lead vehicles, while others may not. To model such phenomena, BehaviorNet predicts the parameters of an agent's motion controller rather than directly predicting its spacetime trajectory (as most forecasters do). Finally, we present AdaptiveDriver, a model-predictive control (MPC) based planner that unrolls different world models conditioned on BehaviorNet's predictions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaptiveDriver achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuPlan closed-loop planning benchmark, improving over prior work by 2% on Test-14 Hard R-CLS, and generalizes even when evaluated on never-before-seen cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This project has been accepted to the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025.

However, current staging models are hardly interpretable, and most public datasets contain no clinical reasoning or interpretation beyond image-level labels. In this paper, we present a novel method that integrates graph representation learning with vision-language models (VLMs) to deliver explainable DR diagnosis. Our approach leverages optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images by constructing biologically informed graphs that encode key retinal vascular features such as vessel morphology and spatial connectivity. A graph neural network (GNN) then performs DR staging while integrated gradients highlight critical nodes and edges and their individual features that drive the classification decisions. We collect this graph-based knowledge which attributes the model's prediction to physiological structures and their characteristics. We then transform it into textual descriptions for VLMs. We perform instruction-tuning with these textual descriptions and the corresponding image to train a student VLM. This final agent can classify the disease and explain its decision in a human interpretable way solely based on a single image input. Experimental evaluations on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate that our method not only improves classification accuracy but also offers more clinically interpretable results. An expert study further demonstrates that our method provides more accurate diagnostic explanations and paves the way for precise localization of pathologies in OCTA images.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Designing Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Discrete Choice with Network Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09786v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel model architecture that incorporates network effects into discrete choice problems, achieving higher predictive performance than standard discrete choice models while offering greater interpretability than general-purpose flexible model classes. Econometric discrete choice models aid in studying individual decision-making, where agents select the option with the highest reward from a discrete set of alternatives. Intuitively, the utility an individual derives from a particular choice depends on their personal preferences and characteristics, the attributes of the alternative, and the value their peers assign to that alternative or their previous choices. However, most applications ignore peer influence, and models that do consider peer or network effects often lack the flexibility and predictive performance of recently developed approaches to discrete choice, such as deep learning. We propose a novel graph convolutional neural network architecture to model network effects in discrete choices, achieving higher predictive performance than standard discrete choice models while retaining the interpretability necessary for inference--a quality often lacking in general-purpose deep learning architectures. We evaluate our architecture using revealed commuting choice data, extended with travel times and trip costs for each travel mode for work-related trips in New York City, as well as 2016 U.S. election data aggregated by county, to test its performance on datasets with highly imbalanced classes. Given the interpretability of our models, we can estimate relevant economic metrics, such as the value of travel time savings in New York City. Finally, we compare the predictive performance and behavioral insights from our architecture to those derived from traditional discrete choice and general-purpose deep learning models.</p></details> |  |

As extreme weather events driven by climate change increase, identifying risky FCs becomes crucial for mitigating cascading failures and ensuring grid stability. However, the complexity of the spatio-temporal dependencies among grid components and the exponential growth of the search space with system size pose significant challenges to modeling and risky FC search. To tackle this, we model the search process as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is subsequently solved via a time-varying graph recurrent neural network (GRNN). This approach captures the spatial and temporal structure induced by the system's topology and dynamics, while efficiently summarizing the system's history in the GRNN's latent space, enabling scalable and effective identification of risky FCs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2303.08864</p></details> |

However, as good as GNNs are for learning graph data, they also come with the risk of privacy leakage. For instance, an attacker can run carefully crafted queries on the GNNs and, from the responses, can infer the existence of an edge between a pair of nodes. This attack, dubbed as a "link-stealing" attack, can jeopardize the user's privacy by leaking potentially sensitive information. To protect against this attack, we propose an approach called "$(N)$ode $(A)$ugmentation for $(R)$estricting $(G)$raphs from $(I)$nsinuating their $(S)$tructure" ($NARGIS$) and study its feasibility. $NARGIS$ is focused on reshaping the graph embedding space so that the posterior from the GNN model will still provide utility for the prediction task but will introduce ambiguity for the link-stealing attackers. To this end, $NARGIS$ applies spectral clustering on the given graph to facilitate it being augmented with new nodes -- that have learned features instead of fixed ones. It utilizes tri-level optimization for learning parameters for the GNN model, surrogate attacker model, and our defense model (i.e. learnable node features). We extensively evaluate $NARGIS$ on three benchmark citation datasets over eight knowledge availability settings for the attackers. We also evaluate the model fidelity and defense performance on influence-based link inference attacks. Through our studies, we have figured out the best feature of $NARGIS$ -- its superior fidelity-privacy performance trade-off in a significant number of cases. We also have discovered in which cases the model needs to be improved, and proposed ways to integrate different schemes to make the model more robust against link stealing attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint for the Accepted Work in The 15th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (CODASPY'25)}, 14 pages</p></details> |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective methods for modeling complex graph data, such as those found in MCC. However, a significant challenge with GNNs is their reliance on an existing graph structure, which is not readily available for MCC. To address this challenge, we propose a novel generative framework for GNNs that constructs a representative underlying graph structure by utilizing the distribution of the data to enhance predictive analytics for MCC. Our framework employs a graph variational autoencoder (GVAE) to capture the complex relationships in patient data. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of individual health trajectories and facilitates the creation of diverse patient stochastic similarity graphs while preserving the original feature set. These variations of patient stochastic similarity graphs, generated from the GVAE decoder, are then processed by a GNN using a novel Laplacian regularization technique to refine the graph structure over time and improves the prediction accuracy of MCC. A contextual Bandit is designed to evaluate the stochastically generated graphs and identify the best-performing graph for the GNN model iteratively until model convergence. We validate the performance of the proposed contextual Bandit algorithm against $\varepsilon$-Greedy and multi-armed Bandit algorithms on a large cohort (n = 1,592) of patients with MCC. These advancements highlight the potential of the proposed approach to transform predictive healthcare analytics, enabling a more personalized and proactive approach to MCC management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics</p></details> |
| **[Post-interactive Multimodal Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09366v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interactions among agents for trajectory prediction of autonomous driving has been challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in agents' behavior. The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of agents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in trajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine Transformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which explicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate coarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in which the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural networks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal Network to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction features are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are sent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed trajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs of the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are learned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory consistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared with the baseline HiVT-64, our model has reduced the prediction errors by 4.4%, 8.4%, 14.4%, 5.7% regarding metrics minADE6, minFDE6, MR6, and brier-minFDE6, respectively.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present Crowdsourced Homophily Ties Based Graph Annotation via Large Language Model (CSA-LLM), a novel approach that combines the strengths of crowdsourced annotations with the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the graph annotation process. CSA-LLM harnesses the structural context of graph data by integrating information from 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors. By emphasizing homophily ties - key connections that signify similarity within the graph - CSA-LLM significantly improves the accuracy of annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that this method enhances the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by delivering more precise and reliable annotations.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose SCOPE-DTI, a unified framework combining a large-scale, balanced semi-inductive human DTI dataset with advanced deep learning modeling. Constructed from 13 public repositories, the SCOPE dataset expands data volume by up to 100-fold compared to common benchmarks such as the Human dataset. The SCOPE model integrates three-dimensional protein and compound representations, graph neural networks, and bilinear attention mechanisms to effectively capture cross domain interaction patterns, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various DTI prediction tasks. Additionally, SCOPE-DTI provides a user-friendly interface and database. We further validate its effectiveness by experimentally identifying anticancer targets of Ginsenoside Rh1. By offering comprehensive data, advanced modeling, and accessible tools, SCOPE-DTI accelerates drug discovery research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural Entropy Guided Unsupervised Graph Out-Of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03241v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emerging of huge amount of unlabeled data, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is vital for ensuring the reliability of graph neural networks (GNNs) by identifying OOD samples from in-distribution (ID) ones during testing, where encountering novel or unknown data is inevitable. Existing methods often suffer from compromised performance due to redundant information in graph structures, which impairs their ability to effectively differentiate between ID and OOD data. To address this challenge, we propose SEGO, an unsupervised framework that integrates structural entropy into OOD detection regarding graph classification. Specifically, within the architecture of contrastive learning, SEGO introduces an anchor view in the form of coding tree by minimizing structural entropy. The obtained coding tree effectively removes redundant information from graphs while preserving essential structural information, enabling the capture of distinct graph patterns between ID and OOD samples. Furthermore, we present a multi-grained contrastive learning scheme at local, global, and tree levels using triplet views, where coding trees with essential information serve as the anchor view. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of SEGO, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in OOD detection. Specifically, our method achieves the best performance on 9 out of 10 dataset pairs, with an average improvement of 3.7\% on OOD detection datasets, significantly surpassing the best competitor by 10.8\% on the FreeSolv/ToxCast dataset pair.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025 (The 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence)</p></details> |
| **[High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263v5)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for theoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</p></details> | 48 pages |

Although substantial research efforts have been made to generate explanations for individual graph instances, identifying global explaining concepts for a GNN still poses great challenges, especially when concepts are desired in a graphical form on the dataset level. While most prior works treat GNNs as black boxes, in this paper, we propose to unbox GNNs by analyzing and extracting critical subtrees incurred by the inner workings of message passing, which correspond to critical subgraphs in the datasets. By aggregating subtrees in an embedding space with an efficient algorithm, which does not require complex subgraph matching or search, we can make intuitive graphical explanations for Message-Passing GNNs on local, class and global levels. We empirically show that our proposed approach not only generates clean subgraph concepts on a dataset level in contrast to existing global explaining methods which generate non-graphical rules (e.g., language or embeddings) as explanations, but it is also capable of providing explanations for individual instances with a comparable or even superior performance as compared to leading local-level GNN explainers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Backdoor Attacks with Reasonable Constraints on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09049v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks against GNNs use fixed-pattern triggers and lack reasonable trigger constraints, overlooking individual graph characteristics and rendering insufficient evasiveness. To tackle the above issues, we propose ABARC, the first Adaptive Backdoor Attack with Reasonable Constraints, applying to both graph-level and node-level tasks in GNNs. For graph-level tasks, we propose a subgraph backdoor attack independent of the graph's topology. It dynamically selects trigger nodes for each target graph and modifies node features with constraints based on graph similarity, feature range, and feature type. For node-level tasks, our attack begins with an analysis of node features, followed by selecting and modifying trigger features, which are then constrained by node similarity, feature range, and feature type. Furthermore, an adaptive edge-pruning mechanism is designed to reduce the impact of neighbors on target nodes, ensuring a high attack success rate (ASR). Experimental results show that even with reasonable constraints for attack evasiveness, our attack achieves a high ASR while incurring a marginal clean accuracy drop (CAD). When combined with the state-of-the-art defense randomized smoothing (RS) method, our attack maintains an ASR over 94%, surpassing existing attacks by more than 7%.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, posing a significant threat to their real-world adoption. Despite initial efforts to defend against specific graph backdoor attacks, there is no work on defending against various types of backdoor attacks where generated triggers have different properties. Hence, we first empirically verify that prediction variance under edge dropping is a crucial indicator for identifying poisoned nodes. With this observation, we propose using random edge dropping to detect backdoors and theoretically show that it can efficiently distinguish poisoned nodes from clean ones. Furthermore, we introduce a novel robust training strategy to efficiently counteract the impact of the triggers. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our framework can effectively identify poisoned nodes, significantly degrade the attack success rate, and maintain clean accuracy when defending against various types of graph backdoor attacks with different properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city roads. This dataset features graphs with over $10^5$ nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs using an eccentricity-based approach, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement - particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution - which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.</p></details> | work in progress |

GCNext creates a feature-rich item co-occurrence graph and learns the corresponding item embeddings in an unsupervised manner. We show on three datasets that integrating GCNext into sequential recommendation algorithms significantly boosts the performance of nearest-neighbor methods as well as neural network models.

Specifically, given two graphs that are independent perturbations of a single random geometric graph with sparse binary features, the task is to recover an unknown one-to-one mapping between the vertices of the two graphs. We show under certain conditions on the sparsity and noise level of the feature vectors, a carefully designed two-layer graph neural network can, with high probability, recover the correct mapping between the vertices with the help of the graph structure. Additionally, we prove that our condition on the noise parameter is tight up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we compare the performance of the graph neural network to directly solving an assignment problem using the noisy vertex features and demonstrate that when the noise level is at least constant, this direct matching fails to achieve perfect recovery, whereas the graph neural network can tolerate noise levels growing as fast as a power of the size of the graph. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical studies as well as real-world data experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables; to appear in the Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2025</p></details> |

A recent trend in GNN research focuses on adaptive multi-hop structure learning, moving beyond fixed-hop aggregation to more flexible and dynamic neighborhood selection. While GAMLP \citep{Zhang_2022} employs separate MLP layers for each multi-hop domain and ImprovingTE \citep{Yao2023ImprovingTE} enhances this by injecting contextualized substructure information, these methods still rely heavily on predefined sampling strategies, which may limit their ability to generalize and maintain stable accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose an \textbf{adaptive reconstruction framework} that dynamically refines multi-hop structure learning. Inspired by "coreset selection" \citep{guo2022deepcore}, our approach adaptively \textbf{reconstructs} node neighborhoods to optimize message passing, ensuring more \textbf{effective and context-aware information flow} across the graph. To further enhance structural robustness, we introduce two key modules: the \textbf{Distance Recomputator} and the \textbf{Topology Reconstructor} (\textcolor{blue}{DRTR}). The Distance Recomputator \textbf{reassesses and recalibrates} node distances based on adaptive graph properties, leading to \textbf{improved node embeddings} that better reflect latent relationships. Meanwhile, the Topology Reconstructor \textbf{dynamically refines local graph structures}, enabling the model to \textbf{adapt to evolving graph topologies} and mitigate the impact of noise and mislabeled data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our \textbf{adaptive reconstruction framework} achieves \textbf{significant improvements} over existing multi-hop-based models, providing more \textbf{stable and accurate} performance in various graph learning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

They encode the image into a graph structure and can be beneficial for efficiently capturing the long-range dependencies typically present in remote sensing imagery. However, an important drawback of these methods is their black-box nature which may hamper their wider usage in critical applications. In this work, we tackle the self-interpretability of the graph-based vision models by proposing our Interpretable Window Vision GNN (i-WiViG) approach, which provides explanations by automatically identifying the relevant subgraphs for the model prediction. This is achieved with window-based image graph processing that constrains the node receptive field to a local image region and by using a self-interpretable graph bottleneck that ranks the importance of the long-range relations between the image regions. We evaluate our approach to remote sensing classification and regression tasks, showing it achieves competitive performance while providing inherent and faithful explanations through the identified relations. Further, the quantitative evaluation reveals that our model reduces the infidelity of post-hoc explanations compared to other Vision GNN models, without sacrificing explanation sparsity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical guarantees for the advantage of GNNs over NNs in generalizing bandlimited functions on Euclidean cubes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05904v9)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as formidable resources for processing graph-based information across diverse applications. While the expressive power of GNNs has traditionally been examined in the context of graph-level tasks, their potential for node-level tasks, such as node classification, where the goal is to interpolate missing node labels from the observed ones, remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we investigate the proficiency of GNNs for such classifications, which can also be cast as a function interpolation problem. Explicitly, we focus on ascertaining the optimal configuration of weights and layers required for a GNN to successfully interpolate a band-limited function over Euclidean cubes. Our findings highlight a pronounced efficiency in utilizing GNNs to generalize a bandlimited function within an $\varepsilon$-error margin. Remarkably, achieving this task necessitates only $O_d((\log\varepsilon^{-1})^d)$ weights and $O_d((\log\varepsilon^{-1})^d)$ training samples. We explore how this criterion stacks up against the explicit constructions of currently available Neural Networks (NNs) designed for similar tasks. Significantly, our result is obtained by drawing an innovative connection between the GNN structures and classical sampling theorems. In essence, our pioneering work marks a meaningful contribution to the research domain, advancing our understanding of the practical GNN applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Regularization for Graph Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10436v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been utilized for various applications ranging from drug discovery to network design and social networks. In many applications, it is impossible to observe some properties of the graph directly; instead, noisy and indirect measurements of these properties are available. These scenarios are coined as Graph Inverse Problems (GRIP). In this work, we introduce a framework leveraging GNNs to solve GRIPs. The framework is based on a combination of likelihood and prior terms, which are used to find a solution that fits the data while adhering to learned prior information. Specifically, we propose to combine recent deep learning techniques that were developed for inverse problems, together with GNN architectures, to formulate and solve GRIP. We study our approach on a number of representative problems that demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 (Oral) |

However, our understanding of the critical process of scoring neighbor nodes remains limited, leading to the underperformance of many existing attentive GNNs. In this paper, we unify the scoring functions of current attentive GNNs and propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KAA), which integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture into the scoring process. KAA enhances the performance of scoring functions across the board and can be applied to nearly all existing attentive GNNs. To compare the expressive power of KAA with other scoring functions, we introduce Maximum Ranking Distance (MRD) to quantitatively estimate their upper bounds in ranking errors for node importance. Our analysis reveals that, under limited parameters and constraints on width and depth, both linear transformation-based and MLP-based scoring functions exhibit finite expressive power. In contrast, our proposed KAA, even with a single-layer KAN parameterized by zero-order B-spline functions, demonstrates nearly infinite expressive power. Extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks using various backbone models show that KAA-enhanced scoring functions consistently outperform their original counterparts, achieving performance improvements of over 20% in some cases.</p></details> |  |

Existing $\textit{end-to-end learning}$ methods for MILP generate values for a subset of decision variables and delegate the remaining problem to traditional MILP solvers. However, this approach often fails to guarantee solution feasibility (i.e., satisfying all constraints) due to inaccurate predictions and primarily focuses on binary decision variables. Satisfying all constraints is a prerequisite for obtaining the optimal solution, and the feasibility issue becomes even more critical with non-binary integer (integer, for short) variables. Thus, addressing the feasibility of MILP involving integer variables is crucial. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based solver that not only finds the first feasible solution but also incrementally discovers better feasible solutions without delegating the remainder to off-the-shelf solvers. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves (near-)optimal solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version (17 pages, 8 figures).

However, the limited availability of molecular data raises concerns regarding GNNs' ability to effectively capture the fundamental principles of physics and chemistry, which constrains their generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised approach termed Equivariant Masked Position Prediction (EMPP), grounded in intramolecular potential and force theory. Unlike conventional attribute masking techniques, EMPP formulates a nuanced position prediction task that is more well-defined and enhances the learning of quantum mechanical features. EMPP also bypasses the approximation of the Gaussian mixture distribution commonly used in denoising methods, allowing for more accurate acquisition of physical properties. Experimental results indicate that EMPP significantly enhances performance of advanced molecular architectures, surpassing state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches. Our code is released in https://github.com/ajy112/EMPP</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

Although Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) efficiently quantifies uncertainty using a Dirichlet distribution over predictive probabilities, existing EDL-based GNN (EGNN) models require modifications to the network architecture and retraining, failing to take advantage of pre-trained models. We propose a plug-and-play framework for uncertainty quantification in GNNs that works with pre-trained models without the need for retraining. Our Evidential Probing Network (EPN) uses a lightweight Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) head to extract evidence from learned representations, allowing efficient integration with various GNN architectures. We further introduce evidence-based regularization techniques, referred to as EPN-reg, to enhance the estimation of epistemic uncertainty with theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed EPN-reg achieves state-of-the-art performance in accurate and efficient uncertainty quantification, making it suitable for real-world deployment.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |
| **[Efficient Traffic Prediction Through Spatio-Temporal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10459v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained considerable attention in recent years for traffic flow prediction due to their ability to learn spatio-temporal pattern representations through a graph-based message-passing framework. Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

We propose HIS_GCNs, a hierarchical importance graph sampling based learning method. By constructing minibatches using sampled subgraphs, HIS_GCNs gives attention to the importance of both core and periphery nodes/edges in a scale-free training graph. Specifically, it preserves the centrum of the core to most minibatches, which maintains connectivity between periphery nodes, and samples periphery edges without core node interference, in order to keep more long chains composed entirely of low-degree nodes in the same minibatch. HIS_GCNs can maximize the discrete Ricci curvature (i.e., Ollivier-Ricci curvatures) of the edges in a subgraph that enables the preservation of important chains for information propagation, and can achieve a low node embedding variance and a high convergence speed. Diverse experiments on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with node classification tasks confirm superior performance of HIS_GCNs in both accuracy and training time.

| **[A Transfer Framework for Enhancing Temporal Graph Learning in Data-Scarce Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00852v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic interactions between entities are prevalent in domains like social platforms, financial systems, healthcare, and e-commerce. These interactions can be effectively represented as time-evolving graphs, where predicting future connections is a key task in applications such as recommendation systems. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have achieved strong results for such predictive tasks but typically require extensive training data, which is often limited in real-world scenarios. One approach to mitigating data scarcity is leveraging pre-trained models from related datasets. However, direct knowledge transfer between TGNNs is challenging due to their reliance on node-specific memory structures, making them inherently difficult to adapt across datasets. To address this, we introduce a novel transfer approach that disentangles node representations from their associated features through a structured bipartite encoding mechanism. This decoupling enables more effective transfer of memory components and other learned inductive patterns from one dataset to another. Empirical evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances TGNN performance in low-data regimes, outperforming non-transfer baselines by up to 56\% and surpassing existing transfer strategies by 36\%</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphGarment: Learning Garment Dynamics for Bimanual Cloth Manipulation Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05817v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical manipulation of garments is often crucial when performing fabric-related tasks, such as hanging garments. However, due to the deformable nature of fabrics, these operations remain a significant challenge for robots in household, healthcare, and industrial environments. In this paper, we propose GraphGarment, a novel approach that models garment dynamics based on robot control inputs and applies the learned dynamics model to facilitate garment manipulation tasks such as hanging. Specifically, we use graphs to represent the interactions between the robot end-effector and the garment. GraphGarment uses a graph neural network (GNN) to learn a dynamics model that can predict the next garment state given the current state and input action in simulation. To address the substantial sim-to-real gap, we propose a residual model that compensates for garment state prediction errors, thereby improving real-world performance. The garment dynamics model is then applied to a model-based action sampling strategy, where it is utilized to manipulate the garment to a reference pre-hanging configuration for garment-hanging tasks. We conducted four experiments using six types of garments to validate our approach in both simulation and real-world settings. In simulation experiments, GraphGarment achieves better garment state prediction performance, with a prediction error 0.46 cm lower than the best baseline. Our approach also demonstrates improved performance in the garment-hanging simulation experiment with enhancements of 12%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. Moreover, real-world robot experiments confirm the robustness of sim-to-real transfer, with an error increase of 0.17 cm compared to simulation results.

Fires can originate at any point within a structure, and simulating every potential fire scenario is both expensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point (MFSP) and an efficient machine learning framework for its identification. The MFSP is defined as the location at which a fire, if initiated, would cause the most severe detrimental impact on the building's stability, effectively representing the worst-case fire scenario. In our framework, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) serves as an efficient and differentiable agent for conventional Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulators by predicting the Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio (MIDR) under fire, which then guides the training and evaluation of the MFSP predictor. Additionally, we enhance our framework with a novel edge update mechanism and a transfer learning-based training scheme. Evaluations on a large-scale simulation dataset demonstrate the good performance of the proposed framework in identifying the MFSP, offering a transformative tool for optimizing fire safety assessments in structural design. All developed datasets and codes are open-sourced online.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review at Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches rely on random masking strategies in either feature or graph space, which may fail to capture task-relevant information fully. We posit that this limitation stems from an inability to achieve minimum redundancy between masked and unmasked components while ensuring maximum relevance of both to potential downstream tasks. Conditional Independence (CI) inherently satisfies the minimum redundancy and maximum relevance criteria, but its application typically requires access to downstream labels. To address this challenge, we introduce CIMAGE, a novel approach that leverages Conditional Independence to guide an effective masking strategy within the latent space. CIMAGE utilizes CI-aware latent factor decomposition to generate two distinct contexts, leveraging high-confidence pseudo-labels derived from unsupervised graph clustering. In this framework, the pretext task involves reconstructing the masked second context solely from the information provided by the first context. Our theoretical analysis further supports the superiority of CIMAGE's novel CI-aware masking method by demonstrating that the learned embedding exhibits approximate linear separability, which enables accurate predictions for the downstream task. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse graph benchmarks illustrate the advantage of CIMAGE, with notably higher average rankings on node classification and link prediction tasks. Notably, our proposed model highlights the under-explored potential of CI in enhancing graph SSL methodologies and offers enriched insights for effective graph representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the WSDM 2025 Oral.

Given the importance of ensuring that published research is methodologically sound and reproducible, in this paper we analyze 10 graph-based RS papers, most of which were published at SIGIR 2022, and assess their impact on subsequent work published in SIGIR 2023. Our analysis reveals several critical points that require attention: (i) the prevalence of bad practices, such as erroneous data splits or information leakage between training and testing data, which call into question the validity of the results; (ii) frequent inconsistencies between the provided artifacts (source code and data) and their descriptions in the paper, causing uncertainty about what is actually being evaluated; and (iii) the preference for new or complex baselines that are weaker compared to simpler ones, creating the impression of continuous improvement even when, particularly for the Amazon-Book dataset, the state-of-the-art has significantly worsened. Due to these issues, we are unable to confirm the claims made in most of the papers we examined and attempted to reproduce.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, the field of graph machine learning is witnessing a paradigm transition from shallow methods to more sophisticated deep learning approaches. The capabilities of foundation models in generalization and adaptation motivate graph machine learning researchers to discuss the potential of developing a new graph learning paradigm. This paradigm envisions models that are pre-trained on extensive graph data and can be adapted for various graph tasks. Despite this burgeoning interest, there is a noticeable lack of clear definitions and systematic analyses pertaining to this new domain. To this end, this article introduces the concept of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), and offers an exhaustive explanation of their key characteristics and underlying technologies. We proceed to classify the existing work related to GFMs into three distinct categories, based on their dependence on graph neural networks and large language models.

Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE extracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the network. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across four real-world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>AISTA...</summary><p>AISTATS 2025 Camera-ready version</p></details> |

(2018)), characterized by task-independent kernels. It is widely accepted that larger network widths contribute to improved generalization (Park et al. (2019)). However, this work challenges this notion by investigating the narrow width limit of the Bayesian Parallel Branching Neural Network (BPB-NN), an architecture that resembles neural networks with residual blocks. We demonstrate that when the width of a BPB-NN is significantly smaller compared to the number of training examples, each branch exhibits more robust learning due to a symmetry breaking of branches in kernel renormalization. Surprisingly, the performance of a BPB-NN in the narrow width limit is generally superior to or comparable to that achieved in the wide width limit in bias-limited scenarios. Furthermore, the readout norms of each branch in the narrow width limit are mostly independent of the architectural hyperparameters but generally reflective of the nature of the data. We demonstrate such phenomenon primarily in the branching graph neural networks, where each branch represents a different order of convolutions of the graph; we also extend the results to other more general architectures such as the residual-MLP and demonstrate that the narrow width effect is a general feature of the branching networks. Our results characterize a newly defined narrow-width regime for parallel branching networks in general.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising GSL solutions, utilizing recursive message passing to encode node-wise inter-dependencies. However, many existing GSL methods heavily depend on explicit graph structural information as supervision signals, leaving them susceptible to challenges such as data noise and sparsity. In this work, we propose GraphEdit, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to learn complex node relationships in graph-structured data. By enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through instruction-tuning over graph structures, we aim to overcome the limitations associated with explicit graph structural information and enhance the reliability of graph structure learning. Our approach not only effectively denoises noisy connections but also identifies node-wise dependencies from a global perspective, providing a comprehensive understanding of the graph structure. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of GraphEdit across various settings.

Existing works typically simply target type identifiers within binary code and achieve type recovery by analyzing variable characteristics within functions. However, we find that the types in real-world binary programs are more complex and often follow specific distribution patterns. In this paper, to gain a profound understanding of the variable type recovery problem in binary code, we first conduct a comprehensive empirical study. We utilize the TYDA dataset, which includes 163,643 binary programs across four architectures and four compiler optimization options, fully reflecting the complexity and diversity of real-world programs. We carefully study the unique patterns that characterize types and variables in binary code, and also investigate the impact of compiler optimizations on them, yielding many valuable insights. Based on our empirical findings, we propose ByteTR, a framework for recovering variable types in binary code. We decouple the target type set to address the issue of unbalanced type distribution and perform static program analysis to tackle the impact of compiler optimizations on variable storage. In light of the ubiquity of variable propagation across functions observed in our study, ByteTR conducts inter-procedural analysis to trace variable propagation and employs a gated graph neural network to capture long-range data flow dependencies for variable type recovery. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of ByteTR. The results demonstrate that ByteTR leads state-of-the-art works in both effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, in real CTF challenge case, the pseudo code optimized by ByteTR significantly improves readability, surpassing leading tools IDA and Ghidra.</p></details> |  |

These vulnerabilities, highlighted by recent global crises, underscore the urgent need for improved visibility and resilience of the supply chain. However, data-sharing limitations often hinder the achievement of comprehensive visibility between organisations or countries due to privacy, security, and regulatory concerns. Moreover, most existing research studies focused on individual firm- or product-level networks, overlooking the multifaceted interactions among diverse entities that characterise real-world supply chains, thus limiting a holistic understanding of supply chain dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) to enhance supply chain visibility through relationship prediction in supply chain knowledge graphs. FL enables collaborative model training across countries by facilitating information sharing without requiring raw data exchange, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and maintaining data security. GCNs empower the framework to capture intricate relational patterns within knowledge graphs, enabling accurate link prediction to uncover hidden connections and provide comprehensive insights into supply chain networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict relationships within country-level supply chain knowledge graphs. This enhanced visibility supports actionable insights, facilitates proactive risk management, and contributes to the development of resilient and adaptive supply chain strategies, ensuring that supply chains are better equipped to navigate the complexities of the global economy.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, submitted to a journal</p></details> |

However, the necessity of explicit graph structures remains underexamined, as existing evaluations conflate preprocessing with architectural contributions. To isolate the true value of GNNs, we propose DiagMLP, a deliberately minimal, topology-agnostic baseline that retains multimodal fusion capabilities while excluding graph modeling. Through ablation experiments across five datasets, DiagMLP achieves performance parity with state-of-the-art GNN-based methods in fault detection, localization, and classification. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that graph structures are indispensable, revealing that: (i) preprocessing pipelines already encode critical dependency information, and (ii) GNN modules contribute marginally beyond multimodality fusion. Our work advocates for systematic re-evaluation of architectural complexity and highlights the need for standardized baseline protocols to validate model innovations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, submitted to conference</p></details> |

While existing security solutions, including AI-based approaches, offer promise, their lack of transparency constraints the understanding of detected threats. Manual analysis remains time-consuming and reliant on scarce expertise. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called XAIDroid that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) and graph attention mechanisms for automatically locating malicious code snippets within malware. By representing code as API call graphs, XAIDroid captures semantic context and enhances resilience against obfuscation. Utilizing the Graph Attention Model (GAM) and Graph Attention Network (GAT), we assign importance scores to API nodes, facilitating focused attention on critical information for malicious code localization. Evaluation on synthetic and real-world malware datasets demonstrates the efficacy of our approach, achieving high recall and F1-score rates for malicious code localization. The successful implementation of automatic malicious code localization enhances the scalability, interpretability, and reliability of malware analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has 13 pages and contains 5 images (3 figures within the paper and 2 author photos).

| **[Neural Snowflakes: Universal Latent Graph Inference via Trainable Latent Geometries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15003v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inductive bias of a graph neural network (GNN) is largely encoded in its specified graph. Latent graph inference relies on latent geometric representations to dynamically rewire or infer a GNN's graph to maximize the GNN's predictive downstream performance, but it lacks solid theoretical foundations in terms of embedding-based representation guarantees. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a trainable deep learning architecture, coined neural snowflake, that can adaptively implement fractal-like metrics on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that any given finite weights graph can be isometrically embedded by a standard MLP encoder. Furthermore, when the latent graph can be represented in the feature space of a sufficiently regular kernel, we show that the combined neural snowflake and MLP encoder do not succumb to the curse of dimensionality by using only a low-degree polynomial number of parameters in the number of nodes. This implementation enables a low-dimensional isometric embedding of the latent graph. We conduct synthetic experiments to demonstrate the superior metric learning capabilities of neural snowflakes when compared to more familiar spaces like Euclidean space. Additionally, we carry out latent graph inference experiments on graph benchmarks. Consistently, the neural snowflake model achieves predictive performance that either matches or surpasses that of the state-of-the-art latent graph inference models. Importantly, this performance improvement is achieved without requiring random search for optimal latent geometry. Instead, the neural snowflake model achieves this enhancement in a differentiable manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages + Appendix, 2 Figures, 9 Tables</p></details> |

However, GNN is designed for general graph encoding and there is a common issue of representation collapse in existing GNN-based deep graph clustering algorithms. We attribute two main reasons for such issue: (i) the inductive bias of GNN models: GNNs tend to generate similar representations for proximal nodes. Since graphs often contain a non-negligible amount of inter-cluster links, the bias results in error message passing and leads to biased clustering; (ii) the clustering guided loss function: most traditional approaches strive to make all samples closer to pre-learned cluster centers, which cause a degenerate solution assigning all data points to a single label thus make all samples and less discriminative. To address these challenges, we investigate graph clustering from a graph cut perspective and propose an innovative and non-GNN-based Deep Cut-informed Graph embedding and Clustering framework, namely DCGC. This framework includes two modules: (i) cut-informed graph encoding; (ii) self-supervised graph clustering via optimal transport. For the encoding module, we derive a cut-informed graph embedding objective to fuse graph structure and attributes by minimizing their joint normalized cut. For the clustering module, we utilize the optimal transport theory to obtain the clustering assignments, which can balance the guidance of proximity to the pre-learned cluster center. With the above two tailored designs, DCGC is more suitable for the graph clustering task, which can effectively alleviate the problem of representation collapse and achieve better performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method is simple but effective compared with benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Such data often comes in the form of time-series signals, based on which real-time predictions can be made locally using an AI model. However, a hardware-software approach capable of making low-latency predictions with low power consumption is required. In this paper, we present a hardware implementation of an event-graph neural network for time-series classification. We leverage an artificial cochlea model to convert the input time-series signals into a sparse event-data format that allows the event-graph to drastically reduce the number of calculations relative to other AI methods. We implemented the design on a SoC FPGA and applied it to the real-time processing of the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset to benchmark our approach against competitive solutions. Our method achieves a floating-point accuracy of 92.7% on the SHD dataset for the base model, which is only 2.4% and 2% less than the state-of-the-art models with over 10% and 67% fewer model parameters, respectively. It also outperforms FPGA-based spiking neural network implementations by 19.3% and 4.5%, achieving 92.3% accuracy for the quantised model while using fewer computational resources and reducing latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for the 21st International Symposium on Applied Reconfigurable Computing ARC 2025, Sevilla, Spain, April 9-11, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Using Subgraph GNNs for Node Classification:an Overlooked Potential Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06614v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the strong performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in node classification. However, most existing GNNs adopt a node-centric perspective and rely on global message passing, leading to high computational and memory costs that hinder scalability. To mitigate these challenges, subgraph-based methods have been introduced, leveraging local subgraphs as approximations of full computational trees. While this approach improves efficiency, it often suffers from performance degradation due to the loss of global contextual information, limiting its effectiveness compared to global GNNs. To address this trade-off between scalability and classification accuracy, we reformulate the node classification task as a subgraph classification problem and propose SubGND (Subgraph GNN for NoDe). This framework introduces a differentiated zero-padding strategy and an Ego-Alter subgraph representation method to resolve label conflicts while incorporating an Adaptive Feature Scaling Mechanism to dynamically adjust feature contributions based on dataset-specific dependencies. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that SubGND achieves performance comparable to or surpassing global message-passing GNNs, particularly in heterophilic settings, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability as a promising solution for node classification.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Improving Graph Neural Networks on Multi-node Tasks with the Labeling Trick](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10074v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study using graph neural networks (GNNs) for \textit{multi-node representation learning}, where a representation for a set of more than one node (such as a link) is to be learned. Existing GNNs are mainly designed to learn single-node representations. When used for multi-node representation learning, a common practice is to directly aggregate the single-node representations obtained by a GNN. In this paper, we show a fundamental limitation of such an approach, namely the inability to capture the dependence among multiple nodes in the node set. A straightforward solution is to distinguish target nodes from others. Formalizing this idea, we propose \text{labeling trick}, which first labels nodes in the graph according to their relationships with the target node set before applying a GNN and then aggregates node representations obtained in the labeled graph for multi-node representations. Besides node sets in graphs, we also extend labeling tricks to posets, subsets and hypergraphs. Experiments verify that the labeling trick technique can boost GNNs on various tasks, including undirected link prediction, directed link prediction, hyperedge prediction, and subgraph prediction. Our work explains the superior performance of previous node-labeling-based methods and establishes a theoretical foundation for using GNNs for multi-node representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Evidence Subgraphs for Financial Risk Detection via Graph Counterfactual and Factual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06441v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Company financial risks pose a significant threat to personal wealth and national economic stability, stimulating increasing attention towards the development of efficient andtimely methods for monitoring them. Current approaches tend to use graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the momentum spillover effect of risks. However, due to the black-box nature of GNNs, these methods leave much to be improved for precise and reliable explanations towards company risks. In this paper, we propose CF3, a novel Counterfactual and Factual learning method for company Financial risk detection, which generates evidence subgraphs on company knowledge graphs to reliably detect and explain company financial risks. Specifically, we first propose a meta-path attribution process based on Granger causality, selecting the meta-paths most relevant to the target node labels to construct an attribution subgraph. Subsequently, we propose anedge-type-aware graph generator to identify important edges, and we also devise a layer-based feature masker to recognize crucial node features. Finally, we utilize counterfactual-factual reasoning and a loss function based on attribution subgraphs to jointly guide the learning of the graph generator and feature masker. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in the field of financial risk detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15247v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance graph neural networks' (GNNs) ability to learn rich representations from unlabeled graph-structured data. However, current GCL models face challenges with computational demands and limited feature utilization, often relying only on basic graph properties like node degrees and edge attributes. This constrains their capacity to fully capture the complex topological characteristics of real-world phenomena represented by graphs. To address these limitations, we propose Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning (TensorMV-GCL), a novel framework that integrates extended persistent homology (EPH) with GCL representations and facilitates multi-scale feature extraction. Our approach uniquely employs tensor aggregation and compression to fuse information from graph and topological features obtained from multiple augmented views of the same graph. By incorporating tensor concatenation and contraction modules, we reduce computational overhead by separating feature tensor aggregation and transformation. Furthermore, we enhance the quality of learned topological features and model robustness through noise-injected EPH. Experiments on molecular, bioinformatic, and social network datasets demonstrate TensorMV-GCL's superiority, outperforming 15 state-of-the-art methods in graph classification tasks across 9 out of 11 benchmarks while achieving comparable results on the remaining two.

The proposed framework integrates a pre-trained graph neural network to predict demand elasticity and inform pricing decisions. The spatio-temporal EV charging demand prediction (EVCDP) dataset from Shenzhen is utilized to capture the geographic and temporal characteristics of the charging stations. The RL model dynamically adjusts prices at individual stations based on occupancy, maximum station capacity, and demand forecasts, ensuring an equitable network load distribution while preventing station overloads. By leveraging spatially-aware demand predictions and a carefully designed reward function, the framework achieves efficient load balancing and adaptive pricing strategies that respond to localized demand and global network dynamics, ensuring improved network stability and user satisfaction. The efficacy of the approach is validated through simulations on the dataset, showing significant improvements in load balancing and reduced overload as the RL agent iteratively interacts with the environment and learns to dynamically adjust pricing strategies based on real-time demand patterns and station constraints. The findings highlight the potential of adaptive pricing and load-balancing strategies to address the complexities of EV infrastructure, paving the way for scalable and user-centric solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>19th ...</summary><p>19th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon 2025)</p></details> |

Model-level interpretations explain what patterns maximize probability of predicting to a certain class. However, existing model-level interpretation methods pose several limitations such as generating invalid explanation graphs and requiring extreme fine-tuning on hyperparameters manually. In this paper, we propose a new Generative Interpretation Network for Model-Level Explanation of Graph Neural Networks (GIN-Graph), to generate reliable model-level explanation graphs. The implicit and likelihood-free generative adversarial networks are exploited to construct explanation graphs similar to original graphs, meanwhile maximizing the prediction probability for a certain class by adopting a novel objective function. Experimental results indicate that GIN-Graph can be easily applied to GNN models trained on a variety of graph datasets to create meaningful explanation graphs without requiring extensive fine-tuning on hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |

This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the GNNs from the perspective of uncertainty with an emphasis on its integration in graph learning. We compare and summarize existing graph uncertainty theory and methods, alongside the corresponding downstream tasks. Thereby, we bridge the gap between theory and practice, meanwhile connecting different GNN communities.

Agents cache the most recent samples from others and communicate over wireless collision channels governed by an underlying graph topology. Our goal is to minimize time-average estimation error and/or age of information with decentralized scalable sampling and transmission policies, considering both oblivious (where decision-making is independent of the physical processes) and non-oblivious policies (where decision-making depends on physical processes). We prove that in oblivious policies, minimizing estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the age of information. The complexity of the problem, especially the multi-dimensional action spaces and arbitrary network topologies, makes theoretical methods for finding optimal transmission policies intractable. We optimize the policies using a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where each agent employs a permutation-equivariant graph neural network architecture. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed framework exhibits desirable transferability properties, allowing transmission policies trained on small- or moderate-size networks to be executed effectively on large-scale topologies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) The trained policies are transferable to larger networks, and their performance gains increase with the number of agents; (iii) The training procedure withstands non-stationarity even if we utilize independent learning techniques; and, (iv) Recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity in independent learning.</p></details> |  |

The central aim of this study is to enhance feature extraction and classification performance by utilizing multiscale object-based image analysis (OBIA). Traditional pixel-based methods often suffer from low accuracy and speckle noise, while single-scale OBIA approaches may overlook crucial information of image objects at different levels of detail. MOB-GCN addresses this issue by extracting and integrating features from multiple segmentation scales to improve classification results using the Multiresolution Graph Network (MGN) architecture that can model fine-grained and global spatial patterns. By constructing a dynamic multiscale graph hierarchy, MOB-GCN offers a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate details and global context of HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that MOB-GCN consistently outperforms single-scale graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in terms of classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and noise reduction, particularly when labeled data is limited. The implementation of MOB-GCN is publicly available at https://github.com/HySonLab/MultiscaleHSI</p></details> |  |

However, the rapid increase in the scale of graph data has introduced significant performance bottlenecks for GNN inference. Both computational complexity and memory usage have risen dramatically, with memory becoming a critical limitation. Although graph sampling-based subgraph learning methods can help mitigate computational and memory demands, they come with drawbacks such as information loss and high redundant computation among subgraphs. This paper introduces an innovative processing paradgim for distributed graph learning that abstracts GNNs with a new set of programming interfaces and leverages Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation technology to its full potential. This paradigm enables GNNs to highly exploit the computational resources of distributed clusters by eliminating the drawbacks of subgraph learning methods, leading to a more efficient inference process. Our experimental results demonstrate that on industry-scale graphs of up to \textbf{500 million nodes and 22.4 billion edges}, our method can produce a performance boost of up to \textbf{27.4 times}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EuroSys 2025 (poster)</p></details> |

We present a novel framework HIPPO-MAT that integrates graph neural networks (GNN) employing a GraphSAGE architecture to compute independent embeddings on each agent with an Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) approach for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. In our system, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) share aggregated observation data via communication channels while independently processing these inputs to generate enriched state embeddings. This design enables dynamic, cost-optimal, conflict-aware task allocation in a 3D grid environment without the need for centralized coordination. A modified A* path planner is incorporated for efficient routing and collision avoidance. Simulation experiments demonstrate scalability with up to 30 agents and preliminary real-world validation on JetBot ROS AI Robots, each running its model on a Jetson Nano and communicating through an ESP-NOW protocol using ESP32-S3, which confirms the practical viability of the approach that incorporates simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Experimental results revealed that our method achieves a high 92.5% conflict-free success rate, with only a 16.49% performance gap compared to the centralized Hungarian method, while outperforming the heuristic decentralized baseline based on greedy approach. Additionally, the framework exhibits scalability with up to 30 agents with allocation processing of 0.32 simulation step time and robustness in responding to dynamically generated tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.02311</p></details> |

Recent SL prediction methods integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) into graph neural networks (GNNs) and employ attention mechanisms to extract local subgraphs as explanations for target gene pairs. However, attention mechanisms often lack fidelity, typically generate a single explanation per gene pair, and fail to ensure trustworthy high-order structures in their explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diverse Graph Information Bottleneck for Synthetic Lethality (DGIB4SL), a KG-based GNN that generates multiple faithful explanations for the same gene pair and effectively encodes high-order structures. Specifically, we introduce a novel DGIB objective, integrating a Determinant Point Process (DPP) constraint into the standard IB objective, and employ 13 motif-based adjacency matrices to capture high-order structures in gene representations. Experimental results show that DGIB4SL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and provides multiple explanations for SL prediction, revealing diverse biological mechanisms underlying SL inference.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods, which typically rely on single experiments, often reach a performance bottleneck and face limitations in handling diverse interference structures. In contrast, we propose leveraging multiple experiments to overcome these limitations. In industry, the use of sequential experiments, often known as the ramp-up process, where traffic to the treatment gradually increases, is common due to operational needs like risk management and cost control. Our approach shifts the focus from operational aspects to the statistical advantages of merging data from multiple experiments. By combining data from sequentially conducted experiments, we aim to estimate the global average treatment effect more effectively. In this paper, we begin by analyzing the bias and variance of the linear regression estimator for GATE under general linear network interference. We demonstrate that bias plays a dominant role in the bias-variance tradeoff and highlight the intrinsic bias reduction achieved by merging data from experiments with strictly different treatment proportions. Herein the improvement introduced by merging two steps of experimental data is essential. In addition, we show that merging more steps of experimental data is unnecessary under general linear interference, while it can become beneficial when nonlinear interference occurs. Furthermore, we look into a more advanced estimator based on graph neural networks. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that the regression-based estimator benefits remarkably from training on merged experiment data, achieving outstanding statistical performance.</p></details> |  |

These models are characterized by their simplicity, good experimental results and computational efficiency. However, their theoretical expressive power still remains unclear, restricting a deeper understanding of the potential of such models. In this work, we concentrate on characterizing the theoretical expressiveness of a wide range of invariant models under fully-connected conditions. We first rigorously characterize the expressiveness of the most classic invariant model, message-passing neural networks incorporating distance (DisGNN), restricting its unidentifiable cases to be only highly symmetric point clouds. We then prove that GeoNGNN, the geometric counterpart of one of the simplest subgraph graph neural networks, can effectively break these corner cases' symmetry and thus achieve E(3)-completeness. By leveraging GeoNGNN as a theoretical tool, we further prove that: 1) most subgraph GNNs developed in traditional graph learning can be seamlessly extended to geometric scenarios with E(3)-completeness; 2) DimeNet, GemNet and SphereNet, three well-established invariant models, are also all capable of achieving E(3)-completeness. Our theoretical results fill the gap in the expressive power of invariant models, contributing to a rigorous and comprehensive understanding of their capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations</p></details> |

In our study, we reveal a critical yet underexplored consequence of integrating attention into edge-featured GNNs: the emergence of Massive Activations (MAs) within attention layers. By developing a novel method for detecting MAs on edge features, we show that these extreme activations are not only activation anomalies but encode domain-relevant signals. Our post-hoc interpretability analysis demonstrates that, in molecular graphs, MAs aggregate predominantly on common bond types (e.g., single and double bonds) while sparing more informative ones (e.g., triple bonds). Furthermore, our ablation studies confirm that MAs can serve as natural attribution indicators, reallocating to less informative edges. Our study assesses various edge-featured attention-based GNN models using benchmark datasets, including ZINC, TOX21, and PROTEINS. Key contributions include (1) establishing the direct link between attention mechanisms and MAs generation in edge-featured GNNs, (2) developing a robust definition and detection method for MAs enabling reliable post-hoc interpretability. Overall, our study reveals the complex interplay between attention mechanisms, edge-featured GNNs model, and MAs emergence, providing crucial insights for relating GNNs internals to domain knowledge.</p></details> |  |

The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+12...</summary><p>10+12 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

We present a comprehensive analysis of time integration methods, highlighting the adaptation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth scheme to enhance long-term prediction robustness in auto-regressive models. Additionally, we improve temporal prediction accuracy through a multi-step rollout strategy that incorporates multiple future time steps during training, supported by three newly proposed approaches that dynamically adjust the importance of each future step. Despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps (a 7:1 prediction-to-training ratio) achieving an error of only 1.6% compared to the vanilla auto-regressive approach. Moreover, our framework demonstrates an 83% improvement in rollout performance over the standard noise injection method, a standard technique for enhancing long-term rollout performance. Its effectiveness is further validated in more challenging scenarios with truncated meshes, showcasing its adaptability and robustness in practical applications. This work introduces a versatile framework for robust long-term spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions that shows potential for mitigating error accumulation across various model types and engineering disciplines.</p></details> |  |

As one of the main biomarkers in the AD diagnosis procedure, brain amyloid positivity is typically identified by positron emission tomography (PET), which is costly and invasive. Brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) may provide a safer and more convenient solution for the AD diagnosis. Recent advances in geometric deep learning have facilitated sMRI analysis and early diagnosis of AD. However, determining AD pathology, such as brain amyloid deposition, in preclinical stage remains challenging, as less significant morphological changes can be observed. As a result, few AD classification models are generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity classification task. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs), on the other hand, have recently achieved remarkable success in predicting brain amyloid positivity and identifying individuals with high risk of being brain amyloid positive. However, individuals in medium risk group still require gold standard tests such as Amyloid PET for further evaluation. Inspired by the recent success of transformer architectures, we propose a geometric deep learning model based on transformer that is both scalable and robust to variations in input volumetric mesh size. Our work introduced a novel tokenization scheme for tetrahedral meshes, incorporating anatomical landmarks generated by a pre-trained Gaussian process model. Our model achieved superior classification performance in AD classification task. In addition, we showed that the model was also generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity prediction with individuals in the medium risk class, where BM alone cannot achieve a clear classification. Our work may enrich geometric deep learning research and improve AD diagnosis accuracy without using expensive and invasive PET scans.</p></details> |  |

However, relying solely on physical sensors can be limited due to their cost, placement constraints, or inability to directly measure certain critical parameters. Virtual sensing addresses these limitations by leveraging readily available sensor data and system knowledge to estimate inaccessible parameters or infer system states. The increasing complexity of industrial systems necessitates deployments of sensors with diverse modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of system states. These sensors capture data at varying frequencies to monitor both rapid and slowly varying system dynamics, as well as local and global state evolutions of the systems. This leads to heterogeneous temporal dynamics, which, particularly under varying operational end environmental conditions, pose a significant challenge for accurate virtual sensing. To address this, we propose a Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network (HTGNN) framework. HTGNN explicitly models signals from diverse sensors and integrates operating conditions into the model architecture. We evaluate HTGNN using two newly released datasets: a bearing dataset with diverse load conditions for bearing load prediction and a year-long simulated dataset for predicting bridge live loads. Our results demonstrate that HTGNN significantly outperforms established baseline methods in both tasks, particularly under highly varying operating conditions. These results highlight HTGNN's potential as a robust and accurate virtual sensing approach for complex systems, paving the way for improved monitoring, predictive maintenance, and enhanced system performance.

Most GNNs typically consist of a sequence of neighborhood aggregation (a.k.a., message-passing) layers, within which the representation of each node is updated based on those of its neighbors. The most expressive message-passing GNNs can be obtained through the use of the sum aggregator and of MLPs for feature transformation, thanks to their universal approximation capabilities. However, the limitations of MLPs recently motivated the introduction of another family of universal approximators, called Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) which rely on a different representation theorem. In this work, we compare the performance of KANs against that of MLPs on graph learning tasks. We implement three new KAN-based GNN layers, inspired respectively by the GCN, GAT and GIN layers. We evaluate two different implementations of KANs using two distinct base families of functions, namely B-splines and radial basis functions. We perform extensive experiments on node classification, link prediction, graph classification and graph regression datasets. Our results indicate that KANs are on-par with or better than MLPs on all tasks studied in this paper. We also show that the size and training speed of RBF-based KANs is only marginally higher than for MLPs, making them viable alternatives.

Such signals can be categorized as inherently directed, for example, the water flow in a pipe network, and undirected, like the diameter of a pipe. Topological methods model edge signals with inherent direction by representing them relative to a so-called orientation assigned to each edge. These approaches can neither model undirected edge signals nor distinguish if an edge itself is directed or undirected. We address these shortcomings by (i) revising the notion of orientation equivariance to enable edge direction-aware topological models, (ii) proposing orientation invariance as an additional requirement to describe signals without inherent direction, and (iii) developing EIGN, an architecture composed of novel direction-aware edge-level graph shift operators, that provably fulfills the aforementioned desiderata. It is the first general-purpose topological GNN for edge-level signals that can model directed and undirected signals while distinguishing between directed and undirected edges. A comprehensive evaluation shows that EIGN outperforms prior work in edge-level tasks, for example, improving in RMSE on flow simulation tasks by up to 23.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixed Graph Contrastive Network for Semi-Supervised Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02796v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved promising performance in semi-supervised node classification in recent years. However, the problem of insufficient supervision, together with representation collapse, largely limits the performance of the GNNs in this field. To alleviate the collapse of node representations in semi-supervised scenario, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning method, termed Mixed Graph Contrastive Network (MGCN). In our method, we improve the discriminative capability of the latent embeddings by an interpolation-based augmentation strategy and a correlation reduction mechanism. Specifically, we first conduct the interpolation-based augmentation in the latent space and then force the prediction model to change linearly between samples. Second, we enable the learned network to tell apart samples across two interpolation-perturbed views through forcing the correlation matrix across views to approximate an identity matrix. By combining the two settings, we extract rich supervision information from both the abundant unlabeled nodes and the rare yet valuable labeled nodes for discriminative representation learning. Extensive experimental results on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the generality of MGCN compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. The code of MGCN is available at https://github.com/xihongyang1999/MGCN on Github.</p></details> |  |

Guiding LLMs to construct thought chains can enhance their deliberate reasoning abilities, but also faces challenges such as hallucination. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can provide explicit structured knowledge for LLMs to alleviate these issues. However, existing KG-enhanced methods often overlook explicit graph learning, making it challenging to efficiently provide precise reasoning chains for LLMs. Following dual-process theory, we propose Dual-Reasoning (DualR), a novel framework that integrates an external system based on Graph Neural Network (GNN) for explicit reasoning on KGs, complementing the implicit reasoning of LLMs through externalized reasoning chains. DualR designs an LLM-empowered GNN module for explicit learning on KGs, efficiently extracting high-quality reasoning chains. These reasoning chains are then refined to a knowledge-enhanced multiple-choice prompt, guiding a frozen LLM to reason thoughtfully for final answer determination. Extensive experiments on three benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that DualR achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches introduce weight sharing across tailored architectures, generating unique GNN architectures for each graph end-to-end. However, existing GraphNAS methods do not account for distribution patterns across different graphs and heavily rely on extensive training data. With sparse or single training graphs, these methods struggle to discover optimal mappings between graphs and architectures, failing to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose node-specific graph neural architecture search(NodeNAS), which aims to tailor distinct aggregation methods for different nodes through disentangling node topology and graph distribution with limited datasets. We further propose adaptive aggregation attention based Multi-dim NodeNAS method(MNNAS), which learns an node-specific architecture customizer with good generalizability. Specifically, we extend the vertical depth of the search space, supporting simultaneous node-specific architecture customization across multiple dimensions. Moreover, we model the power-law distribution of node degrees under varying assortativity, encoding structure invariant information to guide architecture customization across each dimension. Extensive experiments across supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that MNNAS surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms and achieves excellent OOD generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by DASFAA2025</p></details> |

They exhibit high data efficiency during training and significantly reduced inference time for interatomic potential calculations compared to classical approaches. Key to these models is the Clebsch-Gordon (CG) tensor product, a kernel that contracts two dense feature vectors with a highly structured sparse tensor to produce a dense output vector. The operation, which may be repeated millions of times for typical equivariant models, is a costly and inefficient bottleneck. We introduce a GPU sparse kernel generator for the CG tensor product that provides significant speedup over the best existing open and closed-source implementations. Our implementation achieves high performance by carefully managing GPU shared memory through static analysis at model compile-time, minimizing reads and writes to global memory. We break the tensor product into a series of kernels with operands that fit entirely into registers, enabling us to emit long arithmetic instruction streams that maximize instruction-level parallelism. By fusing the CG tensor product with a subsequent graph convolution, we reduce both intermediate storage and global memory traffic over naive approaches that duplicate input data. We also provide optimized kernels for the gradient of the CG tensor product and a novel identity for the higher partial derivatives required to predict interatomic forces. Our fused kernels offer up to 4.5x speedup for the forward pass and 3x for the backward pass over NVIDIA cuEquivariance, as well as >10x speedup over the widely-used e3nn package. We offer up to 5.3x inference-time speedup for the MACE chemistry foundation model over the original unoptimized version.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

The problem is framed as a constrained statistical learning task, where each network node operates using only local information. Opportunistic routing exploits the broadcast nature of wireless communication to dynamically select optimal forwarding nodes, enabling the information to reach the destination through multiple relay nodes simultaneously. To solve this, we propose a State-Augmentation (SA) based distributed optimization approach aimed at maximizing the total information handled by the source nodes in the network. The problem formulation leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which perform graph convolutions based on the topological connections between network nodes. Using an unsupervised learning paradigm, we extract routing policies from the GNN architecture, enabling optimal decisions for source nodes across various flows. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance when training a GNN-parameterized model, particularly when compared to baseline algorithms. Additionally, applying the method to real-world network topologies and wireless ad-hoc network test beds validates its effectiveness, highlighting the robustness and transferability of GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Current methods using dense point clouds for accurate place recognition do not scale well due to computationally expensive scan-to-scan comparisons. Alternative object-centric approaches are more efficient but often struggle with sensitivity to viewpoint variation. In this work, we introduce REGRACE, a novel approach that addresses these challenges of scalability and perspective difference in re-localization by using LiDAR-based submaps. We introduce rotation-invariant features for each labeled object and enhance them with neighborhood context through a graph neural network. To identify potential revisits, we employ a scalable bag-of-words approach, pooling one learned global feature per submap. Additionally, we define a revisit with geometrical consistency cues rather than embedding distance, allowing us to recognize far-away loop closures. Our evaluations demonstrate that REGRACE achieves similar results compared to state-of-the-art place recognition and registration baselines while being twice as fast.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS2025</p></details> |

In most cases, Backscattered Electron (BSE) images obtained using SEM do not contain sufficient information for mineral segmentation. Therefore, imaging is often complemented with point-wise Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) spectral measurements that provide highly accurate information about the chemical composition but that are time-consuming to acquire. This motivates the use of sparse spectral data in conjunction with BSE images for mineral segmentation. The unstructured nature of the spectral data makes most traditional image fusion techniques unsuitable for BSE-EDS fusion. We propose using graph neural networks to fuse the two modalities and segment the mineral phases simultaneously. Our results demonstrate that providing EDS data for as few as 1% of BSE pixels produces accurate segmentation, enabling rapid analysis of mineral samples. The proposed data fusion pipeline is versatile and can be adapted to other domains that involve image data and point-wise measurements.</p></details> |  |

Building on the inherent connection between attention and graph theory, we reformulate the Transformer's attention mechanism as a graph operation and propose Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention. This method leverages advanced graph modeling strategies, including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA), to enrich the representation of relational structures. Our approach captures complex dependencies and generalizes across tasks, as evidenced by a reduced generalization gap and improved learning performance. Additionally, we expand the concept of graph-aware attention to introduce Sparse GIN-Attention, a fine-tuning approach that employs sparse GINs. By interpreting attention matrices as sparse adjacency graphs, this technique enhances the adaptability of pre-trained foundational models with minimal computational overhead, endowing them with graph-aware capabilities. Sparse GIN-Attention fine-tuning achieves improved training dynamics and better generalization compared to alternative methods like low-rank adaption (LoRA). We discuss latent graph-like structures within traditional attention mechanisms, offering a new lens through which Transformers can be understood. By evolving Transformers as hierarchical GIN models for relational reasoning. This perspective suggests profound implications for foundational model development, enabling the design of architectures that dynamically adapt to both local and global dependencies. Applications in bioinformatics, materials science, language modeling, and beyond could benefit from this synthesis of relational and sequential data modeling, setting the stage for interpretable and generalizable modeling strategies.</p></details> |  |

They are used in many domains, from online social networks to complex molecules. Most GNNs leverage the message-passing paradigm and achieve strong performances on various tasks. However, the message-passing mechanism used in most models suffers from over-smoothing as a GNN's depth increases. The over-smoothing degrades GNN's performance due to the increased similarity between the representations of unrelated nodes. This study proposes an adaptive channel-wise message-passing approach to alleviate the over-smoothing. The proposed model, Channel-Attentive GNN, learns how to attend to neighboring nodes and their feature channels. Thus, much diverse information can be transferred between nodes during message-passing. Experiments with widely used benchmark datasets show that the proposed model is more resistant to over-smoothing than baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performances for various graphs with strong heterophily.

While existing approaches have demonstrated success in domains such as computer vision and NLP, their application to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) remains unexplored. These methods often rely on the assumption of shared initialization, which is seldom applicable to GNNs. In this work, we undertake the first benchmarking study of model merging algorithms for GNNs, revealing their limited effectiveness in this context. To address these challenges, we propose GNNMerge, which utilizes a task-agnostic node embedding alignment strategy to merge GNNs. Furthermore, we establish that under a mild relaxation, the proposed optimization objective admits direct analytical solutions for widely used GNN architectures, significantly enhancing its computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations across diverse datasets, tasks, and architectures establish GNNMerge to be up to 24% more accurate than existing methods while delivering over 2 orders of magnitude speed-up compared to training from scratch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leap: Inductive Link Prediction via Learnable TopologyAugmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03331v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction is a crucial task in many downstream applications of graph machine learning. To this end, Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a widely used technique for link prediction, mainly in transductive settings, where the goal is to predict missing links between existing nodes. However, many real-life applications require an inductive setting that accommodates for new nodes, coming into an existing graph. Thus, recently inductive link prediction has attracted considerable attention, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is the popular choice of most studies to learn node representations. However, these approaches have limited expressivity and do not fully capture the graph's structural signal. Therefore, in this work we propose LEAP, an inductive link prediction method based on LEArnable toPology augmentation. Unlike previous methods, LEAP models the inductive bias from both the structure and node features, and hence is more expressive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to provide structural contexts for new nodes via learnable augmentation in inductive settings. Extensive experiments on seven real-world homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs demonstrates that LEAP significantly surpasses SOTA methods. The improvements are up to 22\% and 17\% in terms of AUC and average precision, respectively.

They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models as Predictors in Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03258v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there has been growing interest in Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for graph-based tasks. By leveraging LLMs as predictors, GFMs have demonstrated impressive generalizability across various tasks and datasets. However, existing research on LLMs as predictors has predominantly focused on static graphs, leaving their potential in dynamic graph prediction unexplored. In this work, we pioneer using LLMs for predictive tasks on dynamic graphs. We identify two key challenges: the constraints imposed by context length when processing large-scale historical data and the significant variability in domain characteristics, both of which complicate the development of a unified predictor. To address these challenges, we propose the GraphAgent-Dynamic (GAD) Framework, a multi-agent system that leverages collaborative LLMs. In contrast to using a single LLM as the predictor, GAD incorporates global and local summary agents to generate domain-specific knowledge, enhancing its transferability across domains. Additionally, knowledge reflection agents enable adaptive updates to GAD's knowledge, maintaining a unified and self-consistent architecture. In experiments, GAD demonstrates performance comparable to or even exceeds that of full-supervised graph neural networks without dataset-specific training. Finally, to enhance the task-specific performance of LLM-based predictors, we discuss potential improvements, such as dataset-specific fine-tuning to LLMs. By developing tailored strategies for different tasks, we provide new insights for the future design of LLM-based predictors.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, this mechanism also renders nodes susceptible to the influence of their neighbors. For instance, this will occur when the neighboring nodes are imbalanced or the neighboring nodes contain noise, which can even affect the GNN's ability to generalize out of distribution. We find that ensuring the consistency of the norm for node representations can significantly reduce the impact of these two issues on GNNs. To this end, we propose a regularized optimization method called NodeReg that enforces the consistency of node representation norms. This method is simple but effective and satisfies Lipschitz continuity, thus facilitating stable optimization and significantly improving semi-supervised node classification performance under the above two scenarios. To illustrate, in the imbalance scenario, when training a GCN with an imbalance ratio of 0.1, NodeReg outperforms the most competitive baselines by 1.4%-25.9% in F1 score across five public datasets. Similarly, in the distribution shift scenario, NodeReg outperforms the most competitive baseline by 1.4%-3.1% in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches mostly focus on interpreting the processes as sequences, so-called traces, and feeding them to neural architectures designed to operate on sequential data such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers. In this study, we investigate an alternative way to perform PPM: by transforming each process in its directly-follows-graph (DFG) representation we are able to apply graph neural networks (GNNs) for the prediction tasks. By this, we aim to develop models that are more suitable for complex processes that are long and contain an abundance of loops. In particular, we present different ways to create DFG representations depending on the particular GNN we use. The tested GNNs range from classical node-based to novel edge-based architectures. Further, we investigate the possibility of using multi-graphs. By these steps, we aim to design graph representations that minimize the information loss when transforming traces into graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, a comprehensive understanding of classifier-free guidance is still missing. In this work, we carry out an empirical study to provide a fresh perspective on classifier-free guidance. Concretely, instead of solely focusing on classifier-free guidance, we trace back to the root, i.e., classifier guidance, pinpoint the key assumption for the derivation, and conduct a systematic study to understand the role of the classifier. We find that both classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance achieve conditional generation by pushing the denoising diffusion trajectories away from decision boundaries, i.e., areas where conditional information is usually entangled and is hard to learn. Based on this classifier-centric understanding, we propose a generic postprocessing step built upon flow-matching to shrink the gap between the learned distribution for a pre-trained denoising diffusion model and the real data distribution, majorly around the decision boundaries. Experiments on various datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

We present Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT), a novel paradigm that enables generation and editing through an explicit language reasoning process before outputting images. This approach transforms conventional text-to-image generation and editing into a reasoning-guided framework that analyzes semantic relationships and spatial arrangements. We define the formulation of GoT and construct large-scale GoT datasets containing over 9M samples with detailed reasoning chains capturing semantic-spatial relationships. To leverage the advantages of GoT, we implement a unified framework that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for reasoning chain generation with an end-to-end diffusion model enhanced by our novel Semantic-Spatial Guidance Module. Experiments show our GoT framework achieves excellent performance on both generation and editing tasks, with significant improvements over baselines. Additionally, our approach enables interactive visual generation, allowing users to explicitly modify reasoning steps for precise image adjustments. GoT pioneers a new direction for reasoning-driven visual generation and editing, producing images that better align with human intent.

| **[Distilling Diversity and Control in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10637v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilled diffusion models suffer from a critical limitation: reduced sample diversity compared to their base counterparts. In this work, we uncover that despite this diversity loss, distilled models retain the fundamental concept representations of base models. We demonstrate control distillation - where control mechanisms like Concept Sliders and LoRAs trained on base models can be seamlessly transferred to distilled models and vice-versa, effectively distilling control without any retraining. This preservation of representational structure prompted our investigation into the mechanisms of diversity collapse during distillation. To understand how distillation affects diversity, we introduce Diffusion Target (DT) Visualization, an analysis and debugging tool that reveals how models predict final outputs at intermediate steps. Through DT-Visualization, we identify generation artifacts, inconsistencies, and demonstrate that initial diffusion timesteps disproportionately determine output diversity, while later steps primarily refine details. Based on these insights, we introduce diversity distillation - a hybrid inference approach that strategically employs the base model for only the first critical timestep before transitioning to the efficient distilled model. Our experiments demonstrate that this simple modification not only restores the diversity capabilities from base to distilled models but surprisingly exceeds it, while maintaining nearly the computational efficiency of distilled inference, all without requiring additional training or model modifications.

Addressing the critical challenge of balancing original content preservation with editing task fulfillment, our approach employs a progressive strategy that decomposes complex editing tasks into a sequence of simpler subtasks. Each subtask is controlled through three key synergistic mechanisms: the initial noise, noise added at each denoising step, and cross-attention maps between text prompts and video content. This ensures robust preservation of original video elements while effectively applying the desired edits. Beyond its native video editing capability, we extend V$^2$Edit to 3D scene editing via a "render-edit-reconstruct" process, enabling high-quality, 3D-consistent edits even for tasks involving substantial geometric changes such as object insertion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our V$^2$Edit achieves high-quality and successful edits across various challenging video editing tasks and complex 3D scene editing tasks, thereby establishing state-of-the-art performance in both domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://immortalco.github.io/V2Edit/</p></details> |

Although existing autoregressive VLA methods leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they disrupt the continuity of actions. Meanwhile, some VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions, relying solely on VLM-extracted features, which limits their reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates the strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion policies within a single large language model, rather than simply connecting them. To bridge the generation gap, a collaborative training recipe is proposed that injects the diffusion modeling directly into the next-token prediction. With this recipe, we find that these two forms of action prediction not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying performance across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses these two predictions, leading to more robust control. In experiments, HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods across various simulation and real-world tasks, including both single-arm and dual-arm robots, while demonstrating stable manipulation in previously unseen configurations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, such as reinforcement learning (RL) are task- and body-specific, require extensive reward function engineering, and do not generalize well. Imitation learning offers an alternative but relies heavily on high-quality expert demonstrations, which are difficult to obtain for non-human morphologies. Video diffusion models, on the other hand, are capable of generating realistic videos of various morphologies, from humans to ants. Leveraging this capability, we propose a data-independent approach for skill acquisition that learns 3D motor skills from 2D-generated videos, with generalization capability to unconventional and non-human forms. Specifically, we guide the imitation learning process by leveraging vision transformers for video-based comparisons by calculating pair-wise distance between video embeddings. Along with video-encoding distance, we also use a computed similarity between segmented video frames as a guidance reward. We validate our method on locomotion tasks involving unique body configurations. In humanoid robot locomotion tasks, we demonstrate that 'No-data Imitation Learning' (NIL) outperforms baselines trained on 3D motion-capture data. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging generative video models for physically plausible skill learning with diverse morphologies, effectively replacing data collection with data generation for imitation learning.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate a range of DiT-based architectures--including PixArt-style and MMDiT variants--and compare them with a standard DiT variant which directly processes concatenated text and noise inputs. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that the performance of standard DiT is comparable with those specialized models, while demonstrating superior parameter-efficiency, especially when scaled up. Leveraging the layer-wise parameter sharing strategy, we achieve a further reduction of 66% in model size compared to an MMDiT architecture, with minimal performance impact. Building on an in-depth analysis of critical components such as text encoders and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), we introduce DiT-Air and DiT-Air-Lite. With supervised and reward fine-tuning, DiT-Air achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenEval and T2I CompBench, while DiT-Air-Lite remains highly competitive, surpassing most existing models despite its compact size.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConsisLoRA: Enhancing Content and Style Consistency for LoRA-based Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10614v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Style transfer involves transferring the style from a reference image to the content of a target image. Recent advancements in LoRA-based (Low-Rank Adaptation) methods have shown promise in effectively capturing the style of a single image. However, these approaches still face significant challenges such as content inconsistency, style misalignment, and content leakage. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the limitations of the standard diffusion parameterization, which learns to predict noise, in the context of style transfer. To address these issues, we introduce ConsisLoRA, a LoRA-based method that enhances both content and style consistency by optimizing the LoRA weights to predict the original image rather than noise. We also propose a two-step training strategy that decouples the learning of content and style from the reference image. To effectively capture both the global structure and local details of the content image, we introduce a stepwise loss transition strategy. Additionally, we present an inference guidance method that enables continuous control over content and style strengths during inference. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, our method demonstrates significant improvements in content and style consistency while effectively reducing content leakage.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoSTA$\ast$: Cost-Sensitive Toolpath Agent for Multi-turn Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10613v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models like stable diffusion and DALLE-3 still struggle with multi-turn image editing. We decompose such a task as an agentic workflow (path) of tool use that addresses a sequence of subtasks by AI tools of varying costs. Conventional search algorithms require expensive exploration to find tool paths. While large language models (LLMs) possess prior knowledge of subtask planning, they may lack accurate estimations of capabilities and costs of tools to determine which to apply in each subtask. Can we combine the strengths of both LLMs and graph search to find cost-efficient tool paths? We propose a three-stage approach "CoSTA*" that leverages LLMs to create a subtask tree, which helps prune a graph of AI tools for the given task, and then conducts A* search on the small subgraph to find a tool path. To better balance the total cost and quality, CoSTA* combines both metrics of each tool on every subtask to guide the A* search. Each subtask's output is then evaluated by a vision-language model (VLM), where a failure will trigger an update of the tool's cost and quality on the subtask. Hence, the A* search can recover from failures quickly to explore other paths. Moreover, CoSTA* can automatically switch between modalities across subtasks for a better cost-quality trade-off. We build a novel benchmark of challenging multi-turn image editing, on which CoSTA* outperforms state-of-the-art image-editing models or agents in terms of both cost and quality, and performs versatile trade-offs upon user preference.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, critical limitations persist: reconstruction-based methods exhibit substantial performance deterioration under significant viewpoint deviations from training trajectories, while generation-based techniques struggle with temporal coherence and precise scene controllability. To overcome these challenges, we present MuDG, an innovative framework that integrates Multi-modal Diffusion model with Gaussian Splatting (GS) for Urban Scene Reconstruction. MuDG leverages aggregated LiDAR point clouds with RGB and geometric priors to condition a multi-modal video diffusion model, synthesizing photorealistic RGB, depth, and semantic outputs for novel viewpoints. This synthesis pipeline enables feed-forward NVS without computationally intensive per-scene optimization, providing comprehensive supervision signals to refine 3DGS representations for rendering robustness enhancement under extreme viewpoint changes. Experiments on the Open Waymo Dataset demonstrate that MuDG outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction and synthesis quality.</p></details> |  |

Previous camera-conditioned video generative models suffer from diminished video dynamics and limited range of viewpoints when generating videos with large camera movement. We take an approach that progressively expands the generation of dynamic scenes -- first enhancing dynamic content within individual video clip, then extending this capability to create seamless explorations across broad viewpoint ranges. Specifically, we construct a dataset featuring a large degree of dynamics with camera parameter annotations for training while designing a lightweight camera injection module and training scheme to preserve dynamics of the pretrained models. Building on these improved single-clip techniques, we enable extended scene exploration by allowing users to iteratively specify camera trajectories for generating coherent video sequences. Experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that CameraCtrl Ii enables camera-controlled dynamic scene synthesis with substantially wider spatial exploration than previous approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hehao13.github.io/Projects-CameraCtrl-II/</p></details> |

However, real-world narrative videos require multi-shot scenes with visual and dynamic consistency across shots. In this work, we introduce Long Context Tuning (LCT), a training paradigm that expands the context window of pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models to learn scene-level consistency directly from data. Our method expands full attention mechanisms from individual shots to encompass all shots within a scene, incorporating interleaved 3D position embedding and an asynchronous noise strategy, enabling both joint and auto-regressive shot generation without additional parameters. Models with bidirectional attention after LCT can further be fine-tuned with context-causal attention, facilitating auto-regressive generation with efficient KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate single-shot models after LCT can produce coherent multi-shot scenes and exhibit emerging capabilities, including compositional generation and interactive shot extension, paving the way for more practical visual content creation.

Our approach is based on computer-assisted tools, the adjoint method and established results on the ergodicity of diffusion processes. We do not require any structural assumptions on the stochastic system, work under mild hypoellipticity conditions and outside of perturbative regimes. Therefore, our method allows for the treatment of systems that were so far out of reach from existing mathematical tools. We demonstrate our method to exhibit the chaotic nature of three different systems. Finally, we show the robustness of our approach by combining it with continuation methods to produce bounds on Lyapunov exponents over large parameter regions.</p></details> |  |

These immune cells are attracted to the wound after an injury and they move showing both directional and random motion. Thus, first, we smooth the trajectories and we separate the random from the directional parts of the motion. The smoothing model is based on curve evolution where the curve motion is influenced by the smoothing term and the attracting term. Once we obtain the random sub-trajectories, we analyze them using the mean squared displacement to characterize the type of diffusion. Finally, we compute the velocities on the smoothed trajectories and use them as sparse samples to reconstruct the wound attractant field. To do that, we consider a minimization problem for the vector components and lengths, which leads to solving the Laplace equation with Dirichlet conditions for the sparse samples and zero Neumann boundary conditions on the domain boundary.</p></details> |  |

To counteract, various anti-facial recognition techniques have been proposed for privacy protection by adversarially perturbing face images, among which generative makeup-based approaches are the most popular. However, these methods, designed primarily to impersonate specific target identities, can only achieve weak dodging success rates while increasing the risk of targeted abuse. In addition, they often introduce global visual artifacts or a lack of adaptability to accommodate diverse makeup prompts, compromising user satisfaction. To address the above limitations, we develop MASQUE, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates localized adversarial makeups guided by user-defined text prompts. Built upon precise null-text inversion, customized cross-attention fusion with masking, and a pairwise adversarial guidance mechanism using images of the same individual, MASQUE achieves robust dodging performance without requiring any external identity. Comprehensive evaluations on open-source facial recognition models and commercial APIs demonstrate that MASQUE significantly improves dodging success rates over all baselines, along with higher perceptual fidelity and stronger adaptability to various text makeup prompts.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, tiles have been constructed manually, a method that poses significant limitations in scalability and flexibility. Recent research has attempted to automate this process using generative models. However, current approaches primarily focus on tiling textures and manipulating models for single-image generation, without inherently supporting the creation of multiple interconnected tiles across diverse domains. This paper presents Tiled Diffusion, a novel approach that extends the capabilities of diffusion models to accommodate the generation of cohesive tiling patterns across various domains of image synthesis that require tiling. Our method supports a wide range of tiling scenarios, from self-tiling to complex many-to-many connections, enabling seamless integration of multiple images. Tiled Diffusion automates the tiling process, eliminating the need for manual intervention and enhancing creative possibilities in various applications, such as seamlessly tiling of existing images, tiled texture creation, and 360$^\circ$ synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our website for more information and the code: https://madaror.github.io/tiled-diffusion.github.io/</p></details> |

Agent-based modeling can be used for detailed studies of epidemic diffusion and possible interventions. Modeling of epidemic diffusion in large social contact networks requires the use of parallel algorithms and resources. In this work, we present Loimos, a scalable parallel framework for simulating epidemic diffusion. Loimos uses a hybrid of time-stepping and discrete-event simulation to model disease spread, and is implemented on top of an asynchronous, many-task runtime. We demonstrate that Loimos is to able to achieve significant speedups while scaling to large core counts. In particular, Loimos is able to simulate 200 days of a COVID-19 outbreak on a digital twin of California in about 42 seconds, for an average of 4.6 billion traversed edges per second (TEPS), using 4096 cores on Perlmutter at NERSC.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (including references), 9 figures, accepted at the 39th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS 2025)</p></details> |

In this work, we propose AudioX, a unified Diffusion Transformer model for Anything-to-Audio and Music Generation. Unlike previous domain-specific models, AudioX can generate both general audio and music with high quality, while offering flexible natural language control and seamless processing of various modalities including text, video, image, music, and audio. Its key innovation is a multi-modal masked training strategy that masks inputs across modalities and forces the model to learn from masked inputs, yielding robust and unified cross-modal representations. To address data scarcity, we curate two comprehensive datasets: vggsound-caps with 190K audio captions based on the VGGSound dataset, and V2M-caps with 6 million music captions derived from the V2M dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AudioX not only matches or outperforms state-of-the-art specialized models, but also offers remarkable versatility in handling diverse input modalities and generation tasks within a unified architecture.

By introducing a block-wise autoregressive unit, ACDiT offers a flexible interpolation between token-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion, bypassing the limitations of discrete tokenization. The generation of each block is formulated as a conditional diffusion process, conditioned on prior blocks. ACDiT is easy to implement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) on standard diffusion transformer during training. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We show that ACDiT performs best among all autoregressive baselines under similar model scales on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate that benefiting from autoregressive modeling, pretrained ACDiT can be transferred in visual understanding tasks despite being trained with the diffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual generation tasks. We hope that ACDiT offers a novel perspective on visual autoregressive generation and unlocks new avenues for unified models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AGI, Governments, and Free Societies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05710v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines how artificial general intelligence (AGI) could fundamentally reshape the delicate balance between state capacity and individual liberty that sustains free societies. Building on Acemoglu and Robinson's 'narrow corridor' framework, we argue that AGI poses distinct risks of pushing societies toward either a 'despotic Leviathan' through enhanced state surveillance and control, or an 'absent Leviathan' through the erosion of state legitimacy relative to AGI-empowered non-state actors. Drawing on public administration theory and recent advances in AI capabilities, we analyze how these dynamics could unfold through three key channels: the automation of discretionary decision-making within agencies, the evolution of bureaucratic structures toward system-level architectures, and the transformation of democratic feedback mechanisms. Our analysis reveals specific failure modes that could destabilize liberal institutions. Enhanced state capacity through AGI could enable unprecedented surveillance and control, potentially entrenching authoritarian practices. Conversely, rapid diffusion of AGI capabilities to non-state actors could undermine state legitimacy and governability. We examine how these risks manifest differently at the micro level of individual bureaucratic decisions, the meso level of organizational structure, and the macro level of democratic processes. To preserve the narrow corridor of liberty, we propose a governance framework emphasizing robust technical safeguards, hybrid institutional designs that maintain meaningful human oversight, and adaptive regulatory mechanisms.</p></details> | 40 pages |

The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method has strong capabilities to address video super-resolution challenges.</p></details> |  |

Among these, Foley Sound Synthesis is of particular interest for its role in applications for the creation of multimedia content. Given the temporal-dependent nature of sound, it is crucial to design generative models that can effectively handle the sequential modeling of audio samples. Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have recently been proposed as a valid alternative to previously proposed techniques, demonstrating competitive performance with lower computational complexity. In this paper, we introduce MambaFoley, a diffusion-based model that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage the recently proposed SSM known as Mamba for the Foley sound generation task. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare it with a state-of-the-art Foley sound generative model using both objective and subjective analyses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

We introduce Accelerated Rolling Diffusion, a novel framework for streaming gesture generation that extends rolling diffusion models with structured progressive noise scheduling, enabling seamless long-sequence motion synthesis while preserving realism and diversity. We further propose Rolling Diffusion Ladder Acceleration (RDLA), a new approach that restructures the noise schedule into a stepwise ladder, allowing multiple frames to be denoised simultaneously. This significantly improves sampling efficiency while maintaining motion consistency, achieving up to a 2x speedup with high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. We evaluate our approach on ZEGGS and BEAT, strong benchmarks for real-world applicability. Our framework is universally applicable to any diffusion-based gesture generation model, transforming it into a streaming approach. Applied to three state-of-the-art methods, it consistently outperforms them, demonstrating its effectiveness as a generalizable and efficient solution for real-time, high-fidelity co-speech gesture synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Though PD-DL offers higher acceleration rates than existing clinical fast MRI techniques, their use has been limited outside specialized MRI centers. A key challenge is generalization to underrepresented pathologies or populations, noted in multiple studies, with fine-tuning on target populations suggested for improvement. However, current approaches for PD-DL training require access to raw k-space measurements, which is typically only available at specialized MRI centers that have research agreements for such data access. This is especially an issue for rural and underserved areas, where commercial MRI scanners only provide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we propose Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity (CUPID) for high-quality PD-DL training using only routine clinical reconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner. CUPID evaluates output quality with a compressibility-based approach while ensuring that the output stays consistent with the clinical parallel imaging reconstruction through well-designed perturbations. Our results show CUPID achieves similar quality to established PD-DL training that requires k-space data while outperforming compressed sensing (CS) and diffusion-based generative methods. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in a zero-shot training setup for retrospectively and prospectively sub-sampled acquisitions, attesting to its minimal training burden. As an approach that radically deviates from existing strategies, CUPID presents an opportunity to provide equitable access to fast MRI for underserved populations in an attempt to reduce the inequalities associated with this expensive imaging modality.</p></details> |  |

However, unlike typical physics-based renderers, these neural rendering engines are limited by the lack of manual control over the lighting, which is often essential for improving or personalizing the desired image outcome. In this paper, we show that precise lighting control can be achieved for object relighting simply by providing a coarse shadow of the object. Indeed, we show that injecting only the desired shadow of the object into a pre-trained diffusion-based neural renderer enables it to accurately shade the object according to the desired light position, while properly harmonizing the object (and its shadow) within the target background image. Our method, SpotLight, leverages existing neural rendering approaches and achieves controllable relighting results with no additional training. We show that SpotLight achieves superior object compositing results, both quantitatively and perceptually, as confirmed by a user study, outperforming existing diffusion-based models specifically designed for relighting. We also demonstrate other applications, such as hand-scribbling shadows and full-image relighting, demonstrating its versatility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lvsn.github.io/spotlight</p></details> |

Efficiently compressing 3D shapes while preserving intricate geometric details remains a key challenge. Existing 3D shape VAEs often employ uniform point sampling and 1D/2D latent representations, such as vector sets or triplanes, leading to significant geometric detail loss due to inadequate surface coverage and the absence of explicit 3D representations in the latent space. Although recent work explores 3D latent representations, their large scale hinders high-resolution encoding and efficient training. Given these challenges, we introduce Hyper3D, which enhances VAE reconstruction through efficient 3D representation that integrates hybrid triplane and octree features. First, we adopt an octree-based feature representation to embed mesh information into the network, mitigating the limitations of uniform point sampling in capturing geometric distributions along the mesh surface. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid latent space representation that integrates a high-resolution triplane with a low-resolution 3D grid. This design not only compensates for the lack of explicit 3D representations but also leverages a triplane to preserve high-resolution details. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyper3D outperforms traditional representations by reconstructing 3D shapes with higher fidelity and finer details, making it well-suited for 3D generation pipelines.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods excel in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or single images, personalized multi-subject video generation remains a largely unexplored challenge. This task involves synthesizing videos that incorporate multiple distinct subjects, each defined by separate reference images, while ensuring temporal and spatial consistency. Current approaches primarily rely on mapping subject images to keywords in text prompts, which introduces ambiguity and limits their ability to model subject relationships effectively. In this paper, we propose CINEMA, a novel framework for coherent multi-subject video generation by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach eliminates the need for explicit correspondences between subject images and text entities, mitigating ambiguity and reducing annotation effort. By leveraging MLLM to interpret subject relationships, our method facilitates scalability, enabling the use of large and diverse datasets for training. Furthermore, our framework can be conditioned on varying numbers of subjects, offering greater flexibility in personalized content creation. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves subject consistency, and overall video coherence, paving the way for advanced applications in storytelling, interactive media, and personalized video generation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches customize concepts collectively, whereas real-world applications often require sequential concept integration. This sequential nature can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned concepts are lost. In this paper, we investigate concept forgetting and concept confusion in the continual customization. To tackle these challenges, we present ConceptGuard, a comprehensive approach that combines shift embedding, concept-binding prompts and memory preservation regularization, supplemented by a priority queue which can adaptively update the importance and occurrence order of different concepts. These strategies can dynamically update, unbind and learn the relationship of the previous concepts, thus alleviating concept forgetting and confusion. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our approach outperforms all the baseline methods consistently and significantly in both quantitative and qualitative analyses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

While powerful, SDS struggles with achieving fine-grained alignment to user intent. To overcome this, we introduce RewardSDS, a novel approach that weights noise samples based on alignment scores from a reward model, producing a weighted SDS loss. This loss prioritizes gradients from noise samples that yield aligned high-reward output. Our approach is broadly applicable and can extend SDS-based methods. In particular, we demonstrate its applicability to Variational Score Distillation (VSD) by introducing RewardVSD. We evaluate RewardSDS and RewardVSD on text-to-image, 2D editing, and text-to-3D generation tasks, showing significant improvements over SDS and VSD on a diverse set of metrics measuring generation quality and alignment to desired reward models, enabling state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Enhancing Facial Privacy Protection via Weakening Diffusion Purification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10350v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of social media has led to the widespread sharing of individual portrait images, which pose serious privacy risks due to the capabilities of automatic face recognition (AFR) systems for mass surveillance. Hence, protecting facial privacy against unauthorized AFR systems is essential. Inspired by the generation capability of the emerging diffusion models, recent methods employ diffusion models to generate adversarial face images for privacy protection. However, they suffer from the diffusion purification effect, leading to a low protection success rate (PSR). In this paper, we first propose learning unconditional embeddings to increase the learning capacity for adversarial modifications and then use them to guide the modification of the adversarial latent code to weaken the diffusion purification effect. Moreover, we integrate an identity-preserving structure to maintain structural consistency between the original and generated images, allowing human observers to recognize the generated image as having the same identity as the original. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets, i.e., CelebA-HQ and LADN, demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

We design a Partial noise Prediction strategy to construct an intermediate state of the diffusion model, which serves as the starting sampling point. Central to our approach is a deep noise predictor to estimate the optimal noise maps for the forward diffusion process. Once trained, this noise predictor can be used to initialize the sampling process partially along the diffusion trajectory, generating the desirable high-resolution result. Compared to existing approaches, our method offers a flexible and efficient sampling mechanism that supports an arbitrary number of sampling steps, ranging from one to five. Even with a single sampling step, our method demonstrates superior or comparable performance to recent state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[DreamInsert: Zero-Shot Image-to-Video Object Insertion from A Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10342v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in generative diffusion models have turned many dreams into realities. For video object insertion, existing methods typically require additional information, such as a reference video or a 3D asset of the object, to generate the synthetic motion. However, inserting an object from a single reference photo into a target background video remains an uncharted area due to the lack of unseen motion information. We propose DreamInsert, which achieves Image-to-Video Object Insertion in a training-free manner for the first time. By incorporating the trajectory of the object into consideration, DreamInsert can predict the unseen object movement, fuse it harmoniously with the background video, and generate the desired video seamlessly. More significantly, DreamInsert is both simple and effective, achieving zero-shot insertion without end-to-end training or additional fine-tuning on well-designed image-video data pairs. We demonstrated the effectiveness of DreamInsert through a variety of experiments. Leveraging this capability, we present the first results for Image-to-Video object insertion in a training-free manner, paving exciting new directions for future content creation and synthesis. The code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-Rank Continual Personalization of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04891v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent personalization methods for diffusion models, such as Dreambooth and LoRA, allow fine-tuning pre-trained models to generate new concepts. However, applying these techniques across consecutive tasks in order to include, e.g., new objects or styles, leads to a forgetting of previous knowledge due to mutual interference between their adapters. In this work, we tackle the problem of continual customization under a rigorous regime with no access to past tasks' adapters. In such a scenario, we investigate how different adapters' initialization and merging methods can improve the quality of the final model. To that end, we evaluate the naive continual fine-tuning of customized models and compare this approach with three methods for consecutive adapters' training: sequentially merging new adapters, merging orthogonally initialized adapters, and updating only relevant task-specific weights. In our experiments, we show that the proposed techniques mitigate forgetting when compared to the naive approach. In our studies, we show different traits of selected techniques and their effect on the plasticity and stability of the continually adapted model.

Current self-supervised and unsupervised approaches typically rely on blind-spot networks or sub-image pairs sampling, resulting in pixel information loss and destruction of detailed structural information, thereby significantly constraining the efficacy of such methods. In this paper, we introduce Prompt-SID, a prompt-learning-based single image denoising framework that emphasizes preserving of structural details. This approach is trained in a self-supervised manner using downsampled image pairs. It captures original-scale image information through structural encoding and integrates this prompt into the denoiser. To achieve this, we propose a structural representation generation model based on the latent diffusion process and design a structural attention module within the transformer-based denoiser architecture to decode the prompt. Additionally, we introduce a scale replay training mechanism, which effectively mitigates the scale gap from images of different resolutions. We conduct comprehensive experiments on synthetic, real-world, and fluorescence imaging datasets, showcasing the remarkable effectiveness of Prompt-SID. Our code will be released at https://github.com/huaqlili/Prompt-SID.</p></details> |  |

We consider a general signal-in white noise model where we have access to two independent noisy observations of a function, and of a linear transformation of the function. The linear operator is unknown up to a scalar parameter. We present a Bernstein-von Mises theorem for the marginal posterior of the scalar under regularity assumptions of the operator. We further derive Bernstein-von Mises results for different priors and apply them to two concrete examples: the recovery of the thermal diffusivity in a heat equation problem, and the recovery of a location parameter in a semi-blind deconvolution problem.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present MaterialMVP, a novel end-to-end model for generating PBR textures from 3D meshes and image prompts, addressing key challenges in multi-view material synthesis. Our approach leverages Reference Attention to extract and encode informative latent from the input reference images, enabling intuitive and controllable texture generation. We also introduce a Consistency-Regularized Training strategy to enforce stability across varying viewpoints and illumination conditions, ensuring illumination-invariant and geometrically consistent results. Additionally, we propose Dual-Channel Material Generation, which separately optimizes albedo and metallic-roughness (MR) textures while maintaining precise spatial alignment with the input images through Multi-Channel Aligned Attention. Learnable material embeddings are further integrated to capture the distinct properties of albedo and MR. Experimental results demonstrate that our model generates PBR textures with realistic behavior across diverse lighting scenarios, outperforming existing methods in both consistency and quality for scalable 3D asset creation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Experimental Design via Contrastive Diffusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11826v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) is a powerful tool to reduce the cost of running a sequence of experiments. When based on the Expected Information Gain (EIG), design optimization corresponds to the maximization of some intractable expected contrast between prior and posterior distributions. Scaling this maximization to high dimensional and complex settings has been an issue due to BOED inherent computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a pooled posterior distribution with cost-effective sampling properties and provide a tractable access to the EIG contrast maximization via a new EIG gradient expression. Diffusion-based samplers are used to compute the dynamics of the pooled posterior and ideas from bi-level optimization are leveraged to derive an efficient joint sampling-optimization loop. The resulting efficiency gain allows to extend BOED to the well-tested generative capabilities of diffusion models. By incorporating generative models into the BOED framework, we expand its scope and its use in scenarios that were previously impractical. Numerical experiments and comparison with state-of-the-art methods show the potential of the approach.</p></details> |  |

Isolating individual 3D Gaussian primitives for each object and handling occlusions in scenes remain far from being solved. We propose a novel object extraction method based on two key principles: (1) being object-centric by pruning irrelevant primitives; and (2) leveraging generative inpainting to compensate for missing observations caused by occlusions. For pruning, we analyze the local structure of primitives using K-nearest neighbors, and retain only relevant ones. For inpainting, we employ an off-the-shelf diffusion-based inpainter combined with occlusion reasoning, utilizing the 3D representation of the entire scene. Our findings highlight the crucial synergy between pruning and inpainting, both of which significantly enhance extraction performance. We evaluate our method on a standard real-world dataset and introduce a synthetic dataset for quantitative analysis. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, demonstrating its effectiveness in object extraction from complex scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yeonjin-chang.github.io/ROODI/</p></details> |
| **[Hidden in the Noise: Two-Stage Robust Watermarking for Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04653v4)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques. In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods rely on deterministic decision-making, struggling to generalize across the large anatomical and procedural variations inherent in real-world surgeries.In this paper, we introduce an innovative framework that incorporates stochastic modeling through a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) into conventional deterministic learning for surgical workflow analysis. At the heart of our approach is a collaborative co-training paradigm: the DDPM branch captures procedural uncertainties to enrich feature representations, while the task branch focuses on predicting surgical phases and instrument usage.Theoretically, we demonstrate that this mutual refinement mechanism benefits both branches: the DDPM reduces prediction errors in uncertain scenarios, and the task branch directs the DDPM toward clinically meaningful representations. Notably, the DDPM branch is discarded during inference, enabling real-time predictions without sacrificing accuracy.Experiments on the Cholec80 dataset show that for the anticipation task, our method achieves a 16% reduction in eMAE compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and for phase recognition, it improves the Jaccard score by 1.0%. Additionally, on the AutoLaparo dataset, our method achieves a 1.5% improvement in the Jaccard score for phase recognition, while also exhibiting robust generalization to patient-specific variations.

| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

| **[The R2D2 Deep Neural Network Series for Scalable Non-Cartesian Magnetic Resonance Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09559v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series paradigm for fast and scalable image reconstruction from highly-accelerated non-Cartesian k-space acquisitions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While unrolled DNN architectures provide a robust image formation approach via data-consistency layers, embedding non-uniform fast Fourier transform operators in a DNN can become impractical to train at large scale, e.g in 2D MRI with a large number of coils, or for higher-dimensional imaging. Plug-and-play approaches that alternate a learned denoiser blind to the measurement setting with a data-consistency step are not affected by this limitation but their highly iterative nature implies slow reconstruction. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the R2D2 paradigm that was recently introduced to enable ultra-fast reconstruction for large-scale Fourier imaging in radio astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images iteratively estimated as outputs of DNN modules taking the previous iteration's data residual as input. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. A series of R2D2 DNN modules were sequentially trained in a supervised manner on the fastMRI dataset and validated for 2D multi-coil MRI in simulation and on real data, targeting highly under-sampled radial k-space sampling. Results suggest that a series with only few DNNs achieves superior reconstruction quality over its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net (whose training is also much less scalable), and over the state-of-the-art diffusion-based "Decomposed Diffusion Sampler" approach (also characterised by a slower reconstruction process).</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[LatentSync: Taming Audio-Conditioned Latent Diffusion Models for Lip Sync with SyncNet Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09262v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end audio-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs) have been widely adopted for audio-driven portrait animation, demonstrating their effectiveness in generating lifelike and high-resolution talking videos. However, direct application of audio-conditioned LDMs to lip-synchronization (lip-sync) tasks results in suboptimal lip-sync accuracy. Through an in-depth analysis, we identified the underlying cause as the "shortcut learning problem", wherein the model predominantly learns visual-visual shortcuts while neglecting the critical audio-visual correlations. To address this issue, we explored different approaches for integrating SyncNet supervision into audio-conditioned LDMs to explicitly enforce the learning of audio-visual correlations. Since the performance of SyncNet directly influences the lip-sync accuracy of the supervised model, the training of a well-converged SyncNet becomes crucial. We conducted the first comprehensive empirical studies to identify key factors affecting SyncNet convergence. Based on our analysis, we introduce StableSyncNet, with an architecture designed for stable convergence. Our StableSyncNet achieved a significant improvement in accuracy, increasing from 91% to 94% on the HDTF test set. Additionally, we introduce a novel Temporal Representation Alignment (TREPA) mechanism to enhance temporal consistency in the generated videos. Experimental results show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art lip-sync approaches across various evaluation metrics on the HDTF and VoxCeleb2 datasets.</p></details> |  |

Our method relies on reversing the dynamics of the forward process and using this to learn a score function, which, via Doob's $h$-transform, yields a bridged diffusion process; that is, a process conditioned on an endpoint. In contrast to prior methods, we learn the score term $\nabla_x \log p(t, x; T, y)$ directly, for given $t, y$, completely avoiding first learning a time-reversal. We compare the performance of our algorithm with existing methods and see that it outperforms using the (learned) time-reversals to learn the score term.

| **[Bokeh Diffusion: Defocus Blur Control in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08434v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image models have revolutionized creative fields by generating visually captivating outputs from textual prompts; however, while traditional photography offers precise control over camera settings to shape visual aesthetics -- such as depth-of-field -- current diffusion models typically rely on prompt engineering to mimic such effects. This approach often results in crude approximations and inadvertently altering the scene content. In this work, we propose Bokeh Diffusion, a scene-consistent bokeh control framework that explicitly conditions a diffusion model on a physical defocus blur parameter. By grounding depth-of-field adjustments, our method preserves the underlying scene structure as the level of blur is varied. To overcome the scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera settings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild images with synthetic blur augmentations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves flexible, lens-like blur control but also supports applications such as real image editing via inversion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://atfortes.github.io/projects/bokeh-diffusion/</p></details> |

This is challenging due to the mutual interference between expression and identity: (i) fine expression control signals inevitably introduce appearance-related semantics (e.g., facial contours, and ratio), which impact the identity of the generated portrait; (ii) even coarse-grained expression control can cause facial changes that compromise identity, since they all act on the face. These limitations remain unaddressed by previous generation methods, which primarily rely on coarse control signals or two-stage inference that integrates portrait animation. Here, we introduce EmojiDiff, the first end-to-end solution that enables simultaneous control of extremely detailed expression (RGB-level) and high-fidelity identity in portrait generation. To address the above challenges, EmojiDiff adopts a two-stage scheme involving decoupled training and fine-tuning. For decoupled training, we innovate ID-irrelevant Data Iteration (IDI) to synthesize cross-identity expression pairs by dividing and optimizing the processes of maintaining expression and altering identity, thereby ensuring stable and high-quality data generation. Training the model with this data, we effectively disentangle fine expression features in the expression template from other extraneous information (e.g., identity, skin). Subsequently, we present ID-enhanced Contrast Alignment (ICA) for further fine-tuning. ICA achieves rapid reconstruction and joint supervision of identity and expression information, thus aligning identity representations of images with and without expression control. Experimental results demonstrate that our method remarkably outperforms counterparts, achieves precise expression control with highly maintained identity, and generalizes well to various diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a novel paradigm in generative machine learning, capable of producing new samples that closely mimic observed data. These models learn the gradient of model probabilities, bypassing the need for cumbersome calculations of partition functions across all possible configurations. We explore whether diffusion models can enhance parameter inference by augmenting small datasets. Our findings demonstrate this potential through a synthetic task involving inverse Ising inference and a real-world application of reconstructing missing values in neural activity data. This study serves as a proof-of-concept for using diffusion models for data augmentation in physics-related problems, thereby opening new avenues in data science.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce the first application of a pretrained transformer-based video generative model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and generates highly dynamic, realistic videos for portrait animation, effectively addressing these challenges. The adoption of a new video backbone model makes previous U-Net-based methods for identity maintenance, audio conditioning, and video extrapolation inapplicable. To address this limitation, we design an identity reference network consisting of a causal 3D VAE combined with a stacked series of transformer layers, ensuring consistent facial identity across video sequences. Additionally, we investigate various speech audio conditioning and motion frame mechanisms to enable the generation of continuous video driven by speech audio. Our method is validated through experiments on benchmark and newly proposed wild datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods in generating realistic portraits characterized by diverse orientations within dynamic and immersive scenes.

Existing reinforcement learning from human feedback methods usually rely on predefined heuristic reward functions or pretrained reward models built on large-scale datasets, limiting their applicability to scenarios where collecting such data is costly or difficult. To effectively and efficiently utilize human feedback, we develop a framework, HERO, which leverages online human feedback collected on the fly during model learning. Specifically, HERO features two key mechanisms: (1) Feedback-Aligned Representation Learning, an online training method that captures human feedback and provides informative learning signals for fine-tuning, and (2) Feedback-Guided Image Generation, which involves generating images from SD's refined initialization samples, enabling faster convergence towards the evaluator's intent. We demonstrate that HERO is 4x more efficient in online feedback for body part anomaly correction compared to the best existing method. Additionally, experiments show that HERO can effectively handle tasks like reasoning, counting, personalization, and reducing NSFW content with only 0.5K online feedback.

To address this issue, we propose VIGFace, a novel framework capable of generating synthetic facial images. Our idea originates from pre-assigning virtual identities in the feature space. Initially, we train the face recognition model using a real face dataset and create a feature space for both real and virtual identities, where virtual prototypes are orthogonal to other prototypes. Subsequently, we train the diffusion model based on the established feature space, enabling it to generate authentic human face images from real prototypes and synthesize virtual face images from virtual prototypes. Our proposed framework provides two significant benefits. Firstly, it shows clear separability between existing individuals and virtual face images, allowing one to create synthetic images with confidence and without concerns about privacy and portrait rights. Secondly, it ensures improved performance through data augmentation by incorporating real existing images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our virtual face dataset and framework, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art on various face recognition benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please refer to version 3 if you are citing this paper.

Unlike previous diffusion-based models that treat layout planning and layout-to-image as two separate models, PlanGen jointly models the two tasks into one autoregressive transformer using only next-token prediction. PlanGen integrates layout conditions into the model as context without requiring specialized encoding of local captions and bounding box coordinates, which provides significant advantages over the previous embed-and-pool operations on layout conditions, particularly when dealing with complex layouts. Unified prompting allows PlanGen to perform multitasking training related to layout, including layout planning, layout-to-image generation, image layout understanding, etc. In addition, PlanGen can be seamlessly expanded to layout-guided image manipulation thanks to the well-designed modeling, with teacher-forcing content manipulation policy and negative layout guidance. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our PlanGen in multiple layoutrelated tasks, showing its great potential.

Despite their strong performance in general T2I tasks, our research reveals that these models initially struggle with subject-driven image generation compared to dominant diffusion models. To address this limitation, we introduce Proxy-Tuning, leveraging diffusion models to enhance AR models' capabilities in subject-specific image generation. Our method reveals a striking weak-to-strong phenomenon: fine-tuned AR models consistently outperform their diffusion model supervisors in both subject fidelity and prompt adherence. We analyze this performance shift and identify scenarios where AR models excel, particularly in multi-subject compositions and contextual understanding. This work not only demonstrates impressive results in subject-driven AR image generation, but also unveils the potential of weak-to-strong generalization in the image generation domain, contributing to a deeper understanding of different architectures' strengths and limitations.</p></details> |  |

Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate that ShortDF significantly reduces diffusion time (or steps) while enhancing the visual fidelity of generated samples compared to prior arts.

Efficient and precise editing of these images is critical for these applications. With the advent of Stable Diffusion (SD), high-quality image generation and editing have entered a new era. However, existing methods often struggle to consider each object both individually and part of the whole image editing, both of which are crucial for ensuring consistent quantity perception, resulting in suboptimal perceptual performance. To address these challenges, we propose MoEdit, an auxiliary-free multi-object image editing framework. MoEdit facilitates high-quality multi-object image editing in terms of style transfer, object reinvention, and background regeneration, while ensuring consistent quantity perception between inputs and outputs, even with a large number of objects. To achieve this, we introduce the Feature Compensation (FeCom) module, which ensures the distinction and separability of each object attribute by minimizing the in-between interlacing. Additionally, we present the Quantity Attention (QTTN) module, which perceives and preserves quantity consistency by effective control in editing, without relying on auxiliary tools. By leveraging the SD model, MoEdit enables customized preservation and modification of specific concepts in inputs with high quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our MoEdit achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance in multi-object image editing. Data and codes will be available at https://github.com/Tear-kitty/MoEdit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Diffusion-based Inverse Algorithms under Few-Step Constraint via Learnable Linear Extrapolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10103v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in modeling complex data priors, catalyzing their widespread adoption in solving various inverse problems. However, the inherently iterative nature of diffusion-based inverse algorithms often requires hundreds to thousands of steps, with performance degradation occurring under fewer steps which limits their practical applicability. While high-order diffusion ODE solvers have been extensively explored for efficient diffusion sampling without observations, their application to inverse problems remains underexplored due to the diverse forms of inverse algorithms and their need for repeated trajectory correction based on observations. To address this gap, we first introduce a canonical form that decomposes existing diffusion-based inverse algorithms into three modules to unify their analysis. Inspired by the linear subspace search strategy in the design of high-order diffusion ODE solvers, we propose the Learnable Linear Extrapolation (LLE) method, a lightweight approach that universally enhances the performance of any diffusion-based inverse algorithm that fits the proposed canonical form. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements of the proposed LLE method across multiple algorithms and tasks, indicating its potential for more efficient solutions and boosted performance of diffusion-based inverse algorithms with limited steps. Codes for reproducing our experiments are available at \href{https://github.com/weigerzan/LLE_inverse_problem}{https://github.com/weigerzan/LLE\_inverse\_problem}.</p></details> | preprint |

However, these models often lack effective control over character appearances and interactions, particularly in multi-character scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a new task: \textbf{customized manga generation} and introduce \textbf{DiffSensei}, an innovative framework specifically designed for generating manga with dynamic multi-character control. DiffSensei integrates a diffusion-based image generator with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that acts as a text-compatible identity adapter. Our approach employs masked cross-attention to seamlessly incorporate character features, enabling precise layout control without direct pixel transfer. Additionally, the MLLM-based adapter adjusts character features to align with panel-specific text cues, allowing flexible adjustments in character expressions, poses, and actions. We also introduce \textbf{MangaZero}, a large-scale dataset tailored to this task, containing 43,264 manga pages and 427,147 annotated panels, supporting the visualization of varied character interactions and movements across sequential frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSensei outperforms existing models, marking a significant advancement in manga generation by enabling text-adaptable character customization.

In particular, we assume malicious adversaries exploiting diffusion models for inpainting tasks, such as replacing a specific region with a celebrity. While existing methods for protecting images from manipulation in diffusion-based generative models have primarily focused on image-to-image and text-to-image tasks, the challenge of preventing unauthorized inpainting has been rarely addressed, often resulting in suboptimal protection performance. To mitigate inpainting abuses, we propose ADVPAINT, a novel defensive framework that generates adversarial perturbations that effectively disrupt the adversary's inpainting tasks. ADVPAINT targets the self- and cross-attention blocks in a target diffusion inpainting model to distract semantic understanding and prompt interactions during image generation. ADVPAINT also employs a two-stage perturbation strategy, dividing the perturbation region based on an enlarged bounding box around the object, enhancing robustness across diverse masks of varying shapes and sizes. Our experimental results demonstrate that ADVPAINT's perturbations are highly effective in disrupting the adversary's inpainting tasks, outperforming existing methods; ADVPAINT attains over a 100-point increase in FID and substantial decreases in precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Provably Secure Covert Messaging Using Image-based Diffusion Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10063v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of securely and robustly embedding covert messages into an image-based diffusion model's output. The sender and receiver want to exchange the maximum amount of information possible per diffusion sampled image while remaining undetected. The adversary wants to detect that such communication is taking place by identifying those diffusion samples that contain covert messages. To maximize robustness to transformations of the diffusion sample, a strategy is for the sender and the receiver to embed the message in the initial latents. We first show that prior work that attempted this is easily broken because their embedding technique alters the latents' distribution. We then propose a straightforward method to embed covert messages in the initial latent {\em without} altering the distribution. We prove that our construction achieves indistinguishability to any probabilistic polynomial time adversary. Finally, we discuss and analyze empirically the tradeoffs between embedding capacity, message recovery rates, and robustness. We find that optimizing the inversion method for error correction is crucial for reliability.</p></details> |  |

To enable efficient and reliable simulation of extreme weather events, it is crucial to achieve rapid turnaround, dynamical consistency, and accurate spatio-temporal spectral recovery. We propose an efficient correction diffusion model, TAUDiff, that combines a deterministic spatio-temporal model for mean field downscaling with a smaller generative diffusion model for recovering the fine-scale stochastic features. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on downscaling atmospheric wind velocity fields obtained from coarse GCM simulations. We then extend TAUDiff for computationally efficient kilometer-scale downscaling of atmospheric wind velocity fields. Owing to low inference times, our approach can ensure quicker simulation of extreme events necessary for estimating associated risks and economic losses.</p></details> |  |

Through systematic investigation, we discover this limitation stems from distributional biases rather than inherent model constraints. Our key insight reveals that while models fail on rare compositions when their inversions are common, they can successfully generate similar intermediate compositions (e.g., "mouse chasing boy"). To test this hypothesis, we develop a Role-Bridging Decomposition framework that leverages these intermediates to gradually teach rare relationships without architectural modifications. We introduce ActionBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate action-based relationship generation across stereotypical and counter-stereotypical configurations. Our experiments validate that intermediate compositions indeed facilitate counter-stereotypical generation, with both automatic metrics and human evaluations showing significant improvements over existing approaches. This work not only identifies fundamental biases in current text-to-image systems but demonstrates a promising direction for addressing them through compositional reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Inverse rendering is inherently ill-posed, making it difficult to predict a single accurate solution. To address this challenge, recent generative model-based methods aim to present a range of possible solutions. However, finding a single accurate solution and generating diverse solutions can be conflicting. In this paper, we propose a channel-wise noise scheduling approach that allows a single diffusion model architecture to achieve two conflicting objectives. The resulting two diffusion models, trained with different channel-wise noise schedules, can predict a single highly accurate solution and present multiple possible solutions. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our two models in terms of both diversity and accuracy, which translates to enhanced performance in downstream applications such as object insertion and material editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preference Alignment for Diffusion Model via Explicit Denoised Distribution Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14871v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image generation, making preference alignment for these models increasingly important. The preference labels are typically available only at the terminal of denoising trajectories, which poses challenges in optimizing the intermediate denoising steps. In this paper, we propose to conduct Denoised Distribution Estimation (DDE) that explicitly connects intermediate steps to the terminal denoised distribution. Therefore, preference labels can be used for the entire trajectory optimization. To this end, we design two estimation strategies for our DDE. The first is stepwise estimation, which utilizes the conditional denoised distribution to estimate the model denoised distribution. The second is single-shot estimation, which converts the model output into the terminal denoised distribution via DDIM modeling. Analytically and empirically, we reveal that DDE equipped with two estimation strategies naturally derives a novel credit assignment scheme that prioritizes optimizing the middle part of the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

Existing NPE methods typically rely on normalizing flows, which approximate a distribution by composing many simple, invertible transformations. But flow-based models, while state of the art for NPE, are known to suffer from several limitations, including training instability and sharp trade-offs between representational power and computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of conditional diffusions coupled with high-capacity summary networks for amortized NPE. Conditional diffusions address many of the challenges faced by flow-based methods. Our results show that, across a highly varied suite of benchmarking problems for NPE architectures, diffusions offer improved stability, superior accuracy, and faster training times, even with simpler, shallower models. Building on prior work on diffusions for NPE, we show that these gains persist across a variety of different summary network architectures.

Image encryption plays an important role in securing the online transmission/storage of images from unauthorized access. In this regard, this paper presents a novel diffusion-confusion-based image encryption algorithm named as X-CROSS. The diffusion phase involves a dual-layer block permutation. It involves a bit-level permutation termed Inter-Bit Transference (IBT) using a Bit-Extraction key, and pixel permutation with a unique X-crosspermutation algorithm to effectively scramble the pixels within an image. The proposed algorithm utilizes a resilient 2D chaotic map with non-linear dynamical behavior, assisting in generating complex Extraction Keys. After the permutation phase, the confusion phase proceeds with a dynamic substitution technique on the permuted images, establishing the final encryption layer. This combination of novel permutation and confusion results in the removal of the image's inherent patterns and increases its resistance to cyber-attacks. The close to ideal statistical security results for information entropy, correlation, homogeneity, contrast, and energy validate the proposed scheme's effectiveness in hiding the information within the image.</p></details> |  |
| **[Swing-by Dynamics in Concept Learning and Compositional Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08309v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior work has shown that text-conditioned diffusion models can learn to identify and manipulate primitive concepts underlying a compositional data-generating process, enabling generalization to entirely novel, out-of-distribution compositions. Beyond performance evaluations, these studies develop a rich empirical phenomenology of learning dynamics, showing that models generalize sequentially, respecting the compositional hierarchy of the data-generating process. Moreover, concept-centric structures within the data significantly influence a model's speed of learning the ability to manipulate a concept. In this paper, we aim to better characterize these empirical results from a theoretical standpoint. Specifically, we propose an abstraction of prior work's compositional generalization problem by introducing a structured identity mapping (SIM) task, where a model is trained to learn the identity mapping on a Gaussian mixture with structurally organized centroids. We mathematically analyze the learning dynamics of neural networks trained on this SIM task and show that, despite its simplicity, SIM's learning dynamics capture and help explain key empirical observations on compositional generalization with diffusion models identified in prior work. Our theory also offers several new insights -- e.g., we find a novel mechanism for non-monotonic learning dynamics of test loss in early phases of training. We validate our new predictions by training a text-conditioned diffusion model, bridging our simplified framework and complex generative models. Overall, this work establishes the SIM task as a meaningful theoretical abstraction of concept learning dynamics in modern generative models.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Cosh-DiT, a Co-speech gesture video system with hybrid Diffusion Transformers that perform audio-to-motion and motion-to-video synthesis using discrete and continuous diffusion modeling, respectively. First, we introduce an audio Diffusion Transformer (Cosh-DiT-A) to synthesize expressive gesture dynamics synchronized with speech rhythms. To capture upper body, facial, and hand movement priors, we employ vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) to jointly learn their dependencies within a discrete latent space. Then, for realistic video synthesis conditioned on the generated speech-driven motion, we design a visual Diffusion Transformer (Cosh-DiT-V) that effectively integrates spatial and temporal contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently generates lifelike videos with expressive facial expressions and natural, smooth gestures that align seamlessly with speech.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sunyasheng.github.io/projects/COSH-DIT</p></details> |
| **[There and Back Again: On the relation between Noise and Image Inversions in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23530v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating new samples but lack low-dimensional latent space that encodes the data into meaningful features. Inversion-based techniques try to solve this issue by reversing the denoising process and mapping images back to their approximated starting noise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the relation between the initial Gaussian noise, the generated samples, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we show that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise predicted for smooth image regions. Next, we explain the origin of this phenomenon, demonstrating that, during the first inversion steps, the noise prediction error is much more significant for the plain areas than for the rest of the image. Finally, we present the consequences of the divergence between latents and noises by showing that the space of image inversions is notably less manipulative than the original Gaussian noise. This leads to a low diversity of generated interpolations or editions based on the DDIM inversion procedure and ill-defined latent-to-image mapping.

| **[A Chaotic Image Encryption Scheme Using Novel Geometric Block Permutation and Dynamic Substitution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09939v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this digital era, ensuring the security of digital data during transmission and storage is crucial. Digital data, particularly image data, needs to be protected against unauthorized access. To address this, this paper presents a novel image encryption scheme based on a confusion diffusion architecture. The diffusion module introduces a novel geometric block permutation technique, which effectively scrambles the pixels based on geometric shape extraction of pixels. The image is converted into four blocks, and pixels are extracted from these blocks using L-shape, U-shape, square-shape, and inverted U-shape patterns for each block, respectively. This robust extraction and permutation effectively disrupts the correlation within the image. Furthermore, the confusion module utilises bit-XOR and dynamic substitution techniques. For the bit-XOR operation, 2D Henon map has been utilised to generate a chaotic seed matrix, which is bit-XORed with the scrambled image. The resultant image then undergoes the dynamic substitution process to complete confusion phase. A statistical security analysis demonstrates the superior security of the proposed scheme, with being high uncertainty and unpredictability, achieving an entropy of 7.9974 and a correlation coefficient of 0.0014. These results validate the proposed scheme's effectiveness in securing digital images.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of training data impedes progress in this field. This paper introduces PanoGen++, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by generating varied and pertinent panoramic environments for VLN tasks. PanoGen++ incorporates pre-trained diffusion models with domain-specific fine-tuning, employing parameter-efficient techniques such as low-rank adaptation to minimize computational costs. We investigate two settings for environment generation: masked image inpainting and recursive image outpainting. The former maximizes novel environment creation by inpainting masked regions based on textual descriptions, while the latter facilitates agents' learning of spatial relationships within panoramas. Empirical evaluations on room-to-room (R2R), room-for-room (R4R), and cooperative vision-and-dialog navigation (CVDN) datasets reveal significant performance enhancements: a 2.44% increase in success rate on the R2R test leaderboard, a 0.63% improvement on the R4R validation unseen set, and a 0.75-meter enhancement in goal progress on the CVDN validation unseen set. PanoGen++ augments the diversity and relevance of training environments, resulting in improved generalization and efficacy in VLN tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by Neural Networks</p></details> |

Diffusion based models, among the various approaches to video generation, have achieved state of the art quality with their iterative denoising procedures. However, the intrinsic complexity of the video domain renders the training of such diffusion models exceedingly expensive in terms of both data curation and computational resources. Moreover, these models typically operate on a fixed noise tensor that represents the video, resulting in predetermined spatial and temporal dimensions. Although several high quality open-source pretrained video diffusion models, jointly trained on images and videos of varying lengths and resolutions, are available, it is generally not recommended to specify a video length at inference that was not included in the training set. Consequently, these models are not readily adaptable to the direct generation of longer videos by merely increasing the specified video length. In addition to feasibility challenges, long-video generation also encounters quality issues. The domain of long videos is inherently more complex than that of short videos: extended durations introduce greater variability and necessitate long-range temporal consistency, thereby increasing the overall difficulty of the task. We propose VideoMerge, a training-free method that can be seamlessly adapted to merge short videos generated by pretrained text-to-video diffusion model. Our approach preserves the model's original expressiveness and consistency while allowing for extended duration and dynamic variation as specified by the user. By leveraging the strengths of pretrained models, our method addresses challenges related to smoothness, consistency, and dynamic content through orthogonal strategies that operate collaboratively to achieve superior quality.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in image and video synthesis using diffusion models, producing high-quality stereo videos remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of maintaining consistent temporal and spatial coherence between left and right views. We introduce StereoCrafter-Zero, a novel framework for zero-shot stereo video generation that leverages video diffusion priors without requiring paired training data. Our key innovations include a noisy restart strategy to initialize stereo-aware latent representations and an iterative refinement process that progressively harmonizes the latent space, addressing issues like temporal flickering and view inconsistencies. In addition, we propose the use of dissolved depth maps to streamline latent space operations by reducing high-frequency depth information. Our comprehensive evaluations, including quantitative metrics and user studies, demonstrate that StereoCrafter-Zero produces high-quality stereo videos with enhanced depth consistency and temporal smoothness, even when depth estimations are imperfect.

While recent advancements have primarily focused on scaling diffusion backbones and improving autoencoder reconstruction quality, the interaction between these components has received comparatively less attention. In this work, we perform a spectral analysis of modern autoencoders and identify inordinate high-frequency components in their latent spaces, which are especially pronounced in the autoencoders with a large bottleneck channel size. We hypothesize that this high-frequency component interferes with the coarse-to-fine nature of the diffusion synthesis process and hinders the generation quality. To mitigate the issue, we propose scale equivariance: a simple regularization strategy that aligns latent and RGB spaces across frequencies by enforcing scale equivariance in the decoder. It requires minimal code changes and only up to 20K autoencoder fine-tuning steps, yet significantly improves generation quality, reducing FID by 19% for image generation on ImageNet-1K 256x256 and FVD by at least 44% for video generation on Kinetics-700 17x256x256.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 22 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

The derived formulas can be easily used in simulations, significantly decreasing the computation time. Moreover, we compute the fractional anisotropy formulas for the diffusion tensors derived from the bimodal von Mises-Fisher and peanut distributions, and show that the peanut distribution is limited in the amount of anisotropy it permits, making the von Mises-Fisher distribution a better choice when modelling anisotropy.</p></details> |  |

At their core is Novel View Synthesis (NVS), a crucial capability that generates diverse unseen viewpoints to accommodate the broad and continuous pose distribution of AVs. Recent advances in radiance fields, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieve photorealistic rendering at real-time speeds and have been widely used in modeling large-scale driving scenes. However, their performance is commonly evaluated using an interpolated setup with highly correlated training and test views. In contrast, extrapolation, where test views largely deviate from training views, remains underexplored, limiting progress in generalizable simulation technology. To address this gap, we leverage publicly available AV datasets with multiple traversals, multiple vehicles, and multiple cameras to build the first Extrapolated Urban View Synthesis (EUVS) benchmark. Meanwhile, we conduct both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of state-of-the-art NVS methods across different evaluation settings. Our results show that current NVS methods are prone to overfitting to training views. Besides, incorporating diffusion priors and improving geometry cannot fundamentally improve NVS under large view changes, highlighting the need for more robust approaches and large-scale training.

Although recent studies make efforts to improve generative quality by aligning denoising process across original and higher resolutions, the root cause of suboptimal generation is still lacking exploration.

To address this issue, we propose a novel training-free approach, introducing a Progressive Boundary Complement (PBC) method. This method creates dynamic virtual image boundaries inside the feature map to enhance position information propagation, enabling high-quality and rich-content high-resolution image synthesis.

A common strategy learns a world model and unrolls it step-by-step at inference, where small errors can rapidly compound. Geometric Horizon Models (GHMs) offer a compelling alternative by directly making predictions of future states, avoiding cumulative inference errors. While GHMs can be conveniently learned by a generative analog to temporal difference (TD) learning, existing methods are negatively affected by bootstrapping predictions at train time and struggle to generate high-quality predictions at long horizons. This paper introduces Temporal Difference Flows (TD-Flow), which leverages the structure of a novel Bellman equation on probability paths alongside flow-matching techniques to learn accurate GHMs at over 5x the horizon length of prior methods. Theoretically, we establish a new convergence result and primarily attribute TD-Flow's efficacy to reduced gradient variance during training. We further show that similar arguments can be extended to diffusion-based methods. Empirically, we validate TD-Flow across a diverse set of domains on both generative metrics and downstream tasks including policy evaluation. Moreover, integrating TD-Flow with recent behavior foundation models for planning over pre-trained policies demonstrates substantial performance gains, underscoring its promise for long-horizon decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Language Generation with Discrete Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09790v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constraints are critical in text generation as LLM outputs are often unreliable when it comes to ensuring generated outputs adhere to user defined instruction or general safety guidelines. To address this gap, we present Constrained Discrete Diffusion (CDD), a novel method for enforcing constraints on natural language by integrating discrete diffusion models with differentiable optimization. Unlike conventional text generators, which often rely on post-hoc filtering or model retraining for controllable generation, we propose imposing constraints directly into the discrete diffusion sampling process. We illustrate how this technique can be applied to satisfy a variety of natural language constraints, including (i) toxicity mitigation by preventing harmful content from emerging, (ii) character and sequence level lexical constraints, and (iii) novel molecule sequence generation with specific property adherence. Experimental results show that our constraint-aware procedure achieves high fidelity in meeting these requirements while preserving fluency and semantic coherence, outperforming auto-regressive and existing discrete diffusion approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure Language Models for Protein Conformation Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18403v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proteins adopt multiple structural conformations to perform their diverse biological functions, and understanding these conformations is crucial for advancing drug discovery. Traditional physics-based simulation methods often struggle with sampling equilibrium conformations and are computationally expensive. Recently, deep generative models have shown promise in generating protein conformations as a more efficient alternative. However, these methods predominantly rely on the diffusion process within a 3D geometric space, which typically centers around the vicinity of metastable states and is often inefficient in terms of runtime. In this paper, we introduce Structure Language Modeling (SLM) as a novel framework for efficient protein conformation generation. Specifically, the protein structures are first encoded into a compact latent space using a discrete variational auto-encoder, followed by conditional language modeling that effectively captures sequence-specific conformation distributions. This enables a more efficient and interpretable exploration of diverse ensemble modes compared to existing methods. Based on this general framework, we instantiate SLM with various popular LM architectures as well as proposing the ESMDiff, a novel BERT-like structure language model fine-tuned from ESM3 with masked diffusion. We verify our approach in various scenarios, including the equilibrium dynamics of BPTI, conformational change pairs, and intrinsically disordered proteins. SLM provides a highly efficient solution, offering a 20-100x speedup than existing methods in generating diverse conformations, shedding light on promising avenues for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025, see https://openreview.net/forum?id=OzUNDnpQyd</p></details> |

In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. For topologically structured data, we devise a frequency-based noising operator to purposefully manipulate, and set, these inductive biases. We first show that appropriate manipulations of the noising forward process can lead DPMs to focus on particular aspects of the distribution to learn. We show that different datasets necessitate different inductive biases, and that appropriate frequency-based noise control induces increased generative performance compared to standard diffusion. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of ignoring information at particular frequencies while learning. We show this in an image corruption and recovery task, where we train a DPM to recover the original target distribution after severe noise corruption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as workshop paper at DeLTa and FPI workshops, ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Our approach combines the precision of a computer graphics pipeline, enabling accurate control over elements such as camera movement, object rotation, and character animation, with the visual fidelity of generative AI to produce high-quality videos from coarsely rendered inputs. To support animations with any initial start point and extended sequences, we adopt a two-stage generation process guided by 3D geometry: 1) 3D-Guided Keyframe Generation, where a customized image diffusion model refines rendered keyframes to ensure consistency and quality, and 2) 3D-Guided Video Interpolation, a training-free approach that generates smooth, high-quality video frames between keyframes using bidirectional guidance. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our framework in producing controllable, high-quality animations from single input images by harmonizing 3D geometry with generative models.

We show that, even if the dynamics are stable (i.e. contracting exponentially quickly), and the expert is smooth and deterministic, any smooth, deterministic imitator policy necessarily suffers error on execution that is exponentially larger, as a function of problem horizon, than the error under the distribution of expert training data. Our negative result applies to both behavior cloning and offline-RL algorithms, unless they produce highly "improper" imitator policies--those which are non-smooth, non-Markovian, or which exhibit highly state-dependent stochasticity--or unless the expert trajectory distribution is sufficiently "spread." We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of these more complex policy parameterizations, explicating the benefits of today's popular policy parameterizations in robot learning (e.g. action-chunking and Diffusion Policies). We also establish a host of complementary negative and positive results for imitation in control systems.</p></details> | 98 pages, 2 figures |

These findings call into question the usability of generative models, especially in light of the legal and privacy risks brought about by memorization. To better understand this phenomenon, we propose the manifold memorization hypothesis (MMH), a geometric framework which leverages the manifold hypothesis into a clear language in which to reason about memorization. We propose to analyze memorization in terms of the relationship between the dimensionalities of (i) the ground truth data manifold and (ii) the manifold learned by the model. This framework provides a formal standard for "how memorized" a datapoint is and systematically categorizes memorized data into two types: memorization driven by overfitting and memorization driven by the underlying data distribution. By analyzing prior work in the context of the MMH, we explain and unify assorted observations in the literature. We empirically validate the MMH using synthetic data and image datasets up to the scale of Stable Diffusion, developing new tools for detecting and preventing generation of memorized samples in the process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

This work studies the process of post-training these models for accurate world modeling through the lens of the simple, yet fundamental, physics task of modeling object freefall. We show state-of-the-art video generation models struggle with this basic task, despite their visually impressive outputs. To remedy this problem, we find that fine-tuning on a relatively small amount of simulated videos is effective in inducing the dropping behavior in the model, and we can further improve results through a novel reward modeling procedure we introduce. Our study also reveals key limitations of post-training in generalization and distribution modeling. Additionally, we release a benchmark for this task that may serve as a useful diagnostic tool for tracking physical accuracy in large-scale video generative model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeformPAM: Data-Efficient Learning for Long-horizon Deformable Object Manipulation via Preference-based Action Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11584v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, imitation learning has made progress in the field of robotic manipulation. However, it still faces challenges when addressing complex long-horizon tasks with deformable objects, such as high-dimensional state spaces, complex dynamics, and multimodal action distributions. Traditional imitation learning methods often require a large amount of data and encounter distributional shifts and accumulative errors in these tasks. To address these issues, we propose a data-efficient general learning framework (DeformPAM) based on preference learning and reward-guided action selection. DeformPAM decomposes long-horizon tasks into multiple action primitives, utilizes 3D point cloud inputs and diffusion models to model action distributions, and trains an implicit reward model using human preference data. During the inference phase, the reward model scores multiple candidate actions, selecting the optimal action for execution, thereby reducing the occurrence of anomalous actions and improving task completion quality. Experiments conducted on three challenging real-world long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. Results show that DeformPAM improves both task completion quality and efficiency compared to baseline methods even with limited data. Code and data will be available at https://deform-pam.robotflow.ai.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025.

| **[Accelerating Diffusion Sampling via Exploiting Local Transition Coherence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09675v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based diffusion models have made significant breakthroughs in generating high-quality images and videos from textual descriptions. However, the lengthy sampling time of the denoising process remains a significant bottleneck in practical applications. Previous methods either ignore the statistical relationships between adjacent steps or rely on attention or feature similarity between them, which often only works with specific network structures. To address this issue, we discover a new statistical relationship in the transition operator between adjacent steps, focusing on the relationship of the outputs from the network. This relationship does not impose any requirements on the network structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel training-free acceleration method called LTC-Accel, which uses the identified relationship to estimate the current transition operator based on adjacent steps. Due to no specific assumptions regarding the network structure, LTC-Accel is applicable to almost all diffusion-based methods and orthogonal to almost all existing acceleration techniques, making it easy to combine with them. Experimental results demonstrate that LTC-Accel significantly speeds up sampling in text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis while maintaining competitive sample quality. Specifically, LTC-Accel achieves a speedup of 1.67-fold in Stable Diffusion v2 and a speedup of 1.55-fold in video generation models. When combined with distillation models, LTC-Accel achieves a remarkable 10-fold speedup in video generation, allowing real-time generation of more than 16FPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimax Optimality of the Probability Flow ODE for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09583v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion models have become a foundational paradigm for modern generative modeling, demonstrating exceptional capability in generating samples from complex high-dimensional distributions. Despite the dominant adoption of probability flow ODE-based samplers in practice due to their superior sampling efficiency and precision, rigorous statistical guarantees for these methods have remained elusive in the literature. This work develops the first end-to-end theoretical framework for deterministic ODE-based samplers that establishes near-minimax optimal guarantees under mild assumptions on target data distributions. Specifically, focusing on subgaussian distributions with $\beta$-H\"older smooth densities for $\beta\leq 2$, we propose a smooth regularized score estimator that simultaneously controls both the $L^2$ score error and the associated mean Jacobian error. Leveraging this estimator within a refined convergence analysis of the ODE-based sampling process, we demonstrate that the resulting sampler achieves the minimax rate in total variation distance, modulo logarithmic factors. Notably, our theory comprehensively accounts for all sources of error in the sampling process and does not require strong structural conditions such as density lower bounds or Lipschitz/smooth scores on target distributions, thereby covering a broad range of practical data distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClassDiffusion: More Aligned Personalization Tuning with Explicit Class Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17532v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-image customization works have proven successful in generating images of given concepts by fine-tuning diffusion models on a few examples. However, tuning-based methods inherently tend to overfit the concepts, resulting in failure to create the concept under multiple conditions (*e.g.*, headphone is missing when generating "a `dog wearing a headphone"). Interestingly, we notice that the base model before fine-tuning exhibits the capability to compose the base concept with other elements (*e.g.*, "a dog wearing a headphone"), implying that the compositional ability only disappears after personalization tuning. We observe a semantic shift in the customized concept after fine-tuning, indicating that the personalized concept is not aligned with the original concept, and further show through theoretical analyses that this semantic shift leads to increased difficulty in sampling the joint conditional probability distribution, resulting in the loss of the compositional ability. Inspired by this finding, we present **ClassDiffusion**, a technique that leverages a **semantic preservation loss** to explicitly regulate the concept space when learning a new concept. Although simple, this approach effectively prevents semantic drift during the fine-tuning process of the target concepts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the use of semantic preservation loss effectively improves the compositional abilities of fine-tuning models. Lastly, we also extend our ClassDiffusion to personalized video generation, demonstrating its flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR2025, Code is available at https://github.com/Rbrq03/ClassDiffusion</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models. Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching and parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance. Block diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length sequences.

To mitigate this challenge, we note that the reverse process of diffusion exhibits an inherent entropy-reducing nature. Given the inter-frame redundancy in video modality, maintaining full frame rates in high-entropy stages is unnecessary. Based on this insight, we propose TPDiff, a unified framework to enhance training and inference efficiency. By dividing diffusion into several stages, our framework progressively increases frame rate along the diffusion process with only the last stage operating on full frame rate, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. To train the multi-stage diffusion model, we introduce a dedicated training framework: stage-wise diffusion. By solving the partitioned probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODE) of diffusion under aligned data and noise, our training strategy is applicable to various diffusion forms and further enhances training efficiency. Comprehensive experimental evaluations validate the generality of our method, demonstrating 50% reduction in training cost and 1.5x improvement in inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://showlab.github.io/TPDiff/</p></details> |

These problems are often ill-posed, requiring regularization techniques to stabilize the solution. In this work, we employ Flow Matching (FM), a generative framework that integrates a deterministic processes to map a simple reference distribution, such as a Gaussian, to the target distribution. Our method DAWN-FM: Data-AWare and Noise-informed Flow Matching incorporates data and noise embedding, allowing the model to access representations about the measured data explicitly and also account for noise in the observations, making it particularly robust in scenarios where data is noisy or incomplete. By learning a time-dependent velocity field, FM not only provides accurate solutions but also enables uncertainty quantification by generating multiple plausible outcomes. Unlike pre-trained diffusion models, which may struggle in highly ill-posed settings, our approach is trained specifically for each inverse problem and adapts to varying noise levels. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method through extensive numerical experiments on tasks such as image deblurring and tomography.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, existing methods primarily focus on generating whole-organ or large-tissue structures, showing limited effectiveness for organs with fine-grained structure. Due to stringent topological consistency, fragile coronary features, and complex 3D morphological heterogeneity in cardiac imaging, accurately reconstructing fine-grained anatomical details of the heart remains a great challenge. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose the Fine-grained Cardiac image Synthesis(FCaS) framework, established on 3D template conditional diffusion model. FCaS achieves precise cardiac structure generation using Template-guided Conditional Diffusion Model (TCDM) through bidirectional mechanisms, which provides the fine-grained topological structure information of target image through the guidance of template. Meanwhile, we design a deformable Mask Generation Module (MGM) to mitigate the scarcity of high-quality and diverse reference mask in the generation process. Furthermore, to alleviate the confusion caused by imprecise synthetic images, we propose a Confidence-aware Adaptive Learning (CAL) strategy to facilitate the pre-training of downstream segmentation tasks. Specifically, we introduce the Skip-Sampling Variance (SSV) estimation to obtain confidence maps, which are subsequently employed to rectify the pre-training on downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that images generated from FCaS achieves state-of-the-art performance in topological consistency and visual quality, which significantly facilitates the downstream tasks as well.

However, their reliance on publicly available data and the growing trend of data sharing for fine-tuning make these models particularly vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce the Silent Branding Attack, a novel data poisoning method that manipulates text-to-image diffusion models to generate images containing specific brand logos or symbols without any text triggers. We find that when certain visual patterns are repeatedly in the training data, the model learns to reproduce them naturally in its outputs, even without prompt mentions. Leveraging this, we develop an automated data poisoning algorithm that unobtrusively injects logos into original images, ensuring they blend naturally and remain undetected. Models trained on this poisoned dataset generate images containing logos without degrading image quality or text alignment. We experimentally validate our silent branding attack across two realistic settings on large-scale high-quality image datasets and style personalization datasets, achieving high success rates even without a specific text trigger. Human evaluation and quantitative metrics including logo detection show that our method can stealthily embed logos.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

However, existing methods for infrared and visible image translation either achieve unidirectional modality translation or rely on cycle consistency for bidirectional modality translation, which may result in suboptimal performance. In this work, we present the cross-modality translation diffusion model (CM-Diff) for simultaneously modeling data distributions in both the infrared and visible modalities. We address this challenge by combining translation direction labels for guidance during training with cross-modality feature control. Specifically, we view the establishment of the mapping relationship between the two modalities as the process of learning data distributions and understanding modality differences, achieved through a novel Bidirectional Diffusion Training (BDT) strategy. Additionally, we propose a Statistical Constraint Inference (SCI) strategy to ensure the generated image closely adheres to the data distribution of the target modality. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our CM-Diff over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential for generating dual-modality datasets.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies indicate that the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME) highly affects the distribution of NPs across tumors. Hence, it has become a research hotspot to generate the NPs distribution by the aid of multi-modal TME components. However, the distribution divergence among multi-modal TME components may cause side effects i.e., the best uni-modal model may outperform the joint generative model. To address the above issues, we propose a \textbf{D}ivergence-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Diffusion} model (i.e., \textbf{DAMM-Diffusion}) to adaptively generate the prediction results from uni-modal and multi-modal branches in a unified network. In detail, the uni-modal branch is composed of the U-Net architecture while the multi-modal branch extends it by introducing two novel fusion modules i.e., Multi-Modal Fusion Module (MMFM) and Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Module (UAFM). Specifically, the MMFM is proposed to fuse features from multiple modalities, while the UAFM module is introduced to learn the uncertainty map for cross-attention computation. Following the individual prediction results from each branch, the Divergence-Aware Multi-Modal Predictor (DAMMP) module is proposed to assess the consistency of multi-modal data with the uncertainty map, which determines whether the final prediction results come from multi-modal or uni-modal predictions. We predict the NPs distribution given the TME components of tumor vessels and cell nuclei, and the experimental results show that DAMM-Diffusion can generate the distribution of NPs with higher accuracy than the comparing methods. Additional results on the multi-modal brain image synthesis task further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Previous studies have typically focused on either enhancing the visual quality of synthesized images at the expense of sampling efficiency or dramatically accelerating sampling without improving the base model's generative capacity. Moreover, nearly all inference methods have not been able to ensure stable performance simultaneously on both diffusion models (DMs) and visual autoregressive models (ARMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel plug-and-play inference paradigm, CoRe^2, which comprises three subprocesses: Collect, Reflect, and Refine. CoRe^2 first collects classifier-free guidance (CFG) trajectories, and then use collected data to train a weak model that reflects the easy-to-learn contents while reducing number of function evaluations during inference by half. Subsequently, CoRe^2 employs weak-to-strong guidance to refine the conditional output, thereby improving the model's capacity to generate high-frequency and realistic content, which is difficult for the base model to capture. To the best of our knowledge, CoRe^2 is the first to demonstrate both efficiency and effectiveness across a wide range of DMs, including SDXL, SD3.5, and FLUX, as well as ARMs like LlamaGen. It has exhibited significant performance improvements on HPD v2, Pick-of-Pic, Drawbench, GenEval, and T2I-Compbench. Furthermore, CoRe^2 can be seamlessly integrated with the state-of-the-art Z-Sampling, outperforming it by 0.3 and 0.16 on PickScore and AES, while achieving 5.64s time saving using SD3.5.Code is released at https://github.com/xie-lab-ml/CoRe/tree/main.</p></details> |  |

While extensive approaches have been proposed to erase unwanted concepts without requiring retraining from scratch, they inadvertently degrade performance on normal generation tasks. In this work, we propose Interpret then Deactivate (ItD), a novel framework to enable precise concept removal in T2I diffusion models while preserving overall performance. ItD first employs a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to interpret each concept as a combination of multiple features. By permanently deactivating the specific features associated with target concepts, we repurpose SAE as a zero-shot classifier that identifies whether the input prompt includes target concepts, allowing selective concept erasure in diffusion models. Moreover, we demonstrate that ItD can be easily extended to erase multiple concepts without requiring further training. Comprehensive experiments across celebrity identities, artistic styles, and explicit content demonstrate ItD's effectiveness in eliminating targeted concepts without interfering with normal concept generation. Additionally, ItD is also robust against adversarial prompts designed to circumvent content filters.

The recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in AI-empowered 3D content creation. However, although the latest state-of-the-arts are already capable of generating plausible structures and intricate appearances from images or text prompts, the actual mesh surfaces are typically over-smoothing and lack geometric details. This paper introduces SuperCarver, a 3D geometry super-resolution framework particularly tailored for adding texture-consistent surface details to given coarse meshes. Technically, we start by rendering the original textured mesh into the image domain from multiple viewpoints. To achieve geometric detail generation, we develop a deterministic prior-guided normal diffusion model fine-tuned on a carefully curated dataset of paired low-poly and high-poly normal renderings. To optimize mesh structures from potentially imperfect normal map predictions, we design a simple yet effective noise-resistant inverse rendering scheme based on distance field deformation. Extensive experiments show that SuperCarver generates realistic and expressive surface details as depicted by specific texture appearances, making it a powerful tool for automatically upgrading massive outdated low-quality assets and shortening the iteration cycle of high-quality mesh production in practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alias-Free Latent Diffusion Models:Improving Fractional Shift Equivariance of Diffusion Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09419v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are known to have an unstable generation process, where even small perturbations or shifts in the input noise can lead to significantly different outputs. This hinders their applicability in applications requiring consistent results. In this work, we redesign LDMs to enhance consistency by making them shift-equivariant. While introducing anti-aliasing operations can partially improve shift-equivariance, significant aliasing and inconsistency persist due to the unique challenges in LDMs, including 1) aliasing amplification during VAE training and multiple U-Net inferences, and 2) self-attention modules that inherently lack shift-equivariance. To address these issues, we redesign the attention modules to be shift-equivariant and propose an equivariance loss that effectively suppresses the frequency bandwidth of the features in the continuous domain. The resulting alias-free LDM (AF-LDM) achieves strong shift-equivariance and is also robust to irregular warping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AF-LDM produces significantly more consistent results than vanilla LDM across various applications, including video editing and image-to-image translation.

| **[Text-to-3D Generation by 2D Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05929v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilling 3D representations from pretrained 2D diffusion models is essential for 3D creative applications across gaming, film, and interior design. Current SDS-based methods are hindered by inefficient information distillation from diffusion models, which prevents the creation of photorealistic 3D contents. In this paper, we first reevaluate the SDS approach by analyzing its fundamental nature as a basic image editing process that commonly results in over-saturation, over-smoothing, lack of rich content and diversity due to the poor-quality single-step denoising. In light of this, we then propose a novel method called 3D Generation by Editing (GE3D). Each iteration of GE3D utilizes a 2D editing framework that combines a noising trajectory to preserve the information of the input image, alongside a text-guided denoising trajectory. We optimize the process by aligning the latents across both trajectories. This approach fully exploits pretrained diffusion models to distill multi-granularity information through multiple denoising steps, resulting in photorealistic 3D outputs. Both theoretical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach, which not only advances 3D generation technology but also establishes a novel connection between 3D generation and 2D editing. This could potentially inspire further research in the field. Code and demos are released at https://jahnsonblack.github.io/GE3D/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monte Carlo Diffusion for Generalizable Learning-Based RANSAC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09410v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) is a fundamental approach for robustly estimating parametric models from noisy data. Existing learning-based RANSAC methods utilize deep learning to enhance the robustness of RANSAC against outliers. However, these approaches are trained and tested on the data generated by the same algorithms, leading to limited generalization to out-of-distribution data during inference. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based paradigm that progressively injects noise into ground-truth data, simulating the noisy conditions for training learning-based RANSAC. To enhance data diversity, we incorporate Monte Carlo sampling into the diffusion paradigm, approximating diverse data distributions by introducing different types of randomness at multiple stages. We evaluate our approach in the context of feature matching through comprehensive experiments on the ScanNet and MegaDepth datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our Monte Carlo diffusion mechanism significantly improves the generalization ability of learning-based RANSAC. We also develop extensive ablation studies that highlight the effectiveness of key components in our framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diff-CL: A Novel Cross Pseudo-Supervision Method for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09408v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised learning utilizes insights from unlabeled data to improve model generalization, thereby reducing reliance on large labeled datasets. Most existing studies focus on limited samples and fail to capture the overall data distribution. We contend that combining distributional information with detailed information is crucial for achieving more robust and accurate segmentation results. On the one hand, with its robust generative capabilities, diffusion models (DM) learn data distribution effectively. However, it struggles with fine detail capture, leading to generated images with misleading details. Combining DM with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enables the former to learn data distribution while the latter corrects fine details. While capturing complete high-frequency details by CNNs requires substantial computational resources and is susceptible to local noise. On the other hand, given that both labeled and unlabeled data come from the same distribution, we believe that regions in unlabeled data similar to overall class semantics to labeled data are likely to belong to the same class, while regions with minimal similarity are less likely to. This work introduces a semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework from the distribution perspective (Diff-CL). Firstly, we propose a cross-pseudo-supervision learning mechanism between diffusion and convolution segmentation networks. Secondly, we design a high-frequency mamba module to capture boundary and detail information globally. Finally, we apply contrastive learning for label propagation from labeled to unlabeled data. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across three datasets, including left atrium, brain tumor, and NIH pancreas datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-Centric World Model for Language-Guided Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06170v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A world model is essential for an agent to predict the future and plan in domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. To achieve this, recent advancements have focused on video generation, which has gained significant attention due to the impressive success of diffusion models. However, these models require substantial computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a world model leveraging object-centric representation space using slot attention, guided by language instructions. Our model perceives the current state as an object-centric representation and predicts future states in this representation space conditioned on natural language instructions. This approach results in a more compact and computationally efficient model compared to diffusion-based generative alternatives. Furthermore, it flexibly predicts future states based on language instructions, and offers a significant advantage in manipulation tasks where object recognition is crucial. In this paper, we demonstrate that our latent predictive world model surpasses generative world models in visuo-linguo-motor control tasks, achieving superior sample and computation efficiency. We also investigate the generalization performance of the proposed method and explore various strategies for predicting actions using object-centric representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single Image, Any Face: Generalisable 3D Face Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16990v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The creation of 3D human face avatars from a single unconstrained image is a fundamental task that underlies numerous real-world vision and graphics applications. Despite the significant progress made in generative models, existing methods are either less suited in design for human faces or fail to generalise from the restrictive training domain to unconstrained facial images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, Gen3D-Face, which generates 3D human faces with unconstrained single image input within a multi-view consistent diffusion framework. Given a specific input image, our model first produces multi-view images, followed by neural surface construction. To incorporate face geometry information in a generalisable manner, we utilise input-conditioned mesh estimation instead of ground-truth mesh along with synthetic multi-view training data. Importantly, we introduce a multi-view joint generation scheme to enhance appearance consistency among different views. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt and benchmark for creating photorealistic 3D human face avatars from single images for generic human subject across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous alternatives for out-of-domain singe image 3D face generation and top competition for in-domain setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Layton: Latent Consistency Tokenizer for 1024-pixel Image Reconstruction and Generation by 256 Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08377v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image tokenization has significantly advanced visual generation and multimodal modeling, particularly when paired with autoregressive models. However, current methods face challenges in balancing efficiency and fidelity: high-resolution image reconstruction either requires an excessive number of tokens or compromises critical details through token reduction. To resolve this, we propose Latent Consistency Tokenizer (Layton) that bridges discrete visual tokens with the compact latent space of pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling efficient representation of 1024x1024 images using only 256 tokens-a 16 times compression over VQGAN. Layton integrates a transformer encoder, a quantized codebook, and a latent consistency decoder. Direct application of LDM as the decoder results in color and brightness discrepancies. Thus, we convert it to latent consistency decoder, reducing multi-step sampling to 1-2 steps for direct pixel-level supervision. Experiments demonstrate Layton's superiority in high-fidelity reconstruction, with 10.8 reconstruction Frechet Inception Distance on MSCOCO-2017 5K benchmark for 1024x1024 image reconstruction. We also extend Layton to a text-to-image generation model, LaytonGen, working in autoregression. It achieves 0.73 score on GenEval benchmark, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.

Building upon prior work by Careil et al., PerCoV2 extends the original formulation to the Stable Diffusion 3 ecosystem and enhances entropy coding efficiency by explicitly modeling the discrete hyper-latent image distribution. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of recent autoregressive methods (VAR and MaskGIT) for entropy modeling and evaluate our approach on the large-scale MSCOCO-30k benchmark. Compared to previous work, PerCoV2 (i) achieves higher image fidelity at even lower bit-rates while maintaining competitive perceptual quality, (ii) features a hybrid generation mode for further bit-rate savings, and (iii) is built solely on public components. Code and trained models will be released at https://github.com/Nikolai10/PerCoV2.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple and Effective Reinforcement Learning Method for Text-to-Image Diffusion Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00897v4)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a powerful approach for aligning diffusion models with black-box objectives. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is the most popular choice of method for policy optimization. While effective in terms of performance, PPO is highly sensitive to hyper-parameters and involves substantial computational overhead. REINFORCE, on the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high memory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal performance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of the REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and using a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose leave-one-out PPO (LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP combines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling multiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the robustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling. Our results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on various black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between computational efficiency and performance.</p></details> |  |

We utilize colormap to represent entity masks and depth maps, tightly integrating dense prediction with RGB video generation. Introducing dense prediction information improves video generation's consistency and motion smoothness without increasing computational costs. Incorporating learnable task embeddings brings multiple dense prediction tasks into a single model, enhancing flexibility and further boosting performance. We further propose a large-scale dense prediction video dataset~\datasetname, addressing the issue that existing datasets do not concurrently contain captions, videos, segmentation, or depth maps. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the high efficiency of our method, surpassing the state-of-the-art in terms of video quality, consistency, and motion smoothness.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Learning Few-Step Diffusion Models by Trajectory Distribution Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06674v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating diffusion model sampling is crucial for efficient AIGC deployment. While diffusion distillation methods -- based on distribution matching and trajectory matching -- reduce sampling to as few as one step, they fall short on complex tasks like text-to-image generation. Few-step generation offers a better balance between speed and quality, but existing approaches face a persistent trade-off: distribution matching lacks flexibility for multi-step sampling, while trajectory matching often yields suboptimal image quality. To bridge this gap, we propose learning few-step diffusion models by Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), a unified distillation paradigm that combines the strengths of distribution and trajectory matching. Our method introduces a data-free score distillation objective, aligning the student's trajectory with the teacher's at the distribution level. Further, we develop a sampling-steps-aware objective that decouples learning targets across different steps, enabling more adjustable sampling. This approach supports both deterministic sampling for superior image quality and flexible multi-step adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency. Our model, TDM, outperforms existing methods on various backbones, such as SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$, delivering superior quality and significantly reduced training costs. In particular, our method distills PixArt-$\alpha$ into a 4-step generator that outperforms its teacher on real user preference at 1024 resolution. This is accomplished with 500 iterations and 2 A800 hours -- a mere 0.01% of the teacher's training cost. In addition, our proposed TDM can be extended to accelerate text-to-video diffusion. Notably, TDM can outperform its teacher model (CogVideoX-2B) by using only 4 NFE on VBench, improving the total score from 80.91 to 81.65.

A traditional numerical method for solving the resulting high-dimensional coupled system of PDEs is replaced by deep learning techniques. In order to achieve this, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which typically operate on the strong residual of the PDE and can therefore be applied in a wide range of settings, are considered. As a second approach, the Deep Ritz method, which is a neural network that minimizes the Ritz energy functional to find the weak solution, is employed. While the second approach only works in special cases, it overcomes the necessity of testing in variational problems while maintaining mathematical rigor and ensuring the existence of a unique solution. Furthermore, the residual is of a lower differentiation order, reducing the training cost considerably. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on several model problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adding Additional Control to One-Step Diffusion with Joint Distribution Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06652v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion distillation has enabled one-step generation through methods like Variational Score Distillation, adapting distilled models to emerging new controls -- such as novel structural constraints or latest user preferences -- remains challenging. Conventional approaches typically requires modifying the base diffusion model and redistilling it -- a process that is both computationally intensive and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce Joint Distribution Matching (JDM), a novel approach that minimizes the reverse KL divergence between image-condition joint distributions. By deriving a tractable upper bound, JDM decouples fidelity learning from condition learning. This asymmetric distillation scheme enables our one-step student to handle controls unknown to the teacher model and facilitates improved classifier-free guidance (CFG) usage and seamless integration of human feedback learning (HFL). Experimental results demonstrate that JDM surpasses baseline methods such as multi-step ControlNet by mere one-step in most cases, while achieving state-of-the-art performance in one-step text-to-image synthesis through improved usage of CFG or HFL integration.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a theoretical mode-tracking process capable of pinpointing the exact mode of the denoising distribution, and we propose a practical high-density sampler that consistently generates images of higher likelihood than usual samplers. Our empirical findings reveal the existence of significantly higher likelihood samples that typical samplers do not produce, often manifesting as cartoon-like drawings or blurry images depending on the noise level. Curiously, these patterns emerge in datasets devoid of such examples. We also present a novel approach to track sample likelihoods in diffusion SDEs, which remarkably incurs no additional computational cost.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

This paper investigates leveraging generative models to synthesize training data, to train segmentation models for underrepresented modalities, particularly on annotation-scarce MRI. Concretely, our contributions are threefold: (i) we introduce MRGen-DB, a large-scale radiology image-text dataset comprising extensive samples with rich metadata, including modality labels, attributes, regions, and organs information, with a subset having pixelwise mask annotations; (ii) we present MRGen, a diffusion-based data engine for controllable medical image synthesis, conditioned on text prompts and segmentation masks. MRGen can generate realistic images for diverse MRI modalities lacking mask annotations, facilitating segmentation training in low-source domains; (iii) extensive experiments across multiple modalities demonstrate that MRGen significantly improves segmentation performance on unannotated modalities by providing high-quality synthetic data. We believe that our method bridges a critical gap in medical image analysis, extending segmentation capabilities to scenarios that are challenging to acquire manual annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; Project Page: https://haoningwu3639.github.io/MRGen/</p></details> |

Although existing methods can guide generation beyond text prompts, the challenge of effectively combining multiple conditional inputs while maintaining consistency with all of them remains unsolved. To address this, we introduce UniCombine, a DiT-based multi-conditional controllable generative framework capable of handling any combination of conditions, including but not limited to text prompts, spatial maps, and subject images. Specifically, we introduce a novel Conditional MMDiT Attention mechanism and incorporate a trainable LoRA module to build both the training-free and training-based versions. Additionally, we propose a new pipeline to construct SubjectSpatial200K, the first dataset designed for multi-conditional generative tasks covering both the subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditions. Extensive experimental results on multi-conditional generation demonstrate the outstanding universality and powerful capability of our approach with state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

To enhance inference performance while maintaining generation quality, we propose progressive rectified flow transformers. We divide the rectified flow into different stages according to resolution, using fewer transformer layers at the low-resolution stages to generate image layouts and concept contours, and progressively adding more layers as the resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves fast convergence and reduces inference time while ensuring generation quality. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (1) We introduce progressive rectified flow transformers that enable multi-resolution training, accelerating model convergence; (2) NAMI leverages piecewise flow and spatial cascading of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to rapidly generate images, reducing inference time by 40% to generate a 1024 resolution image; (3) We propose NAMI-1K benchmark to evaluate human preference performance, aiming to mitigate distributional bias and prevent data leakage from open-source benchmarks. The results show that our model is competitive with state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Learning Inspired ControlNet Guidance for Augmenting Semantic Segmentation Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09221v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in conditional image generation from diffusion models have shown great potential in achieving impressive image quality while preserving the constraints introduced by the user. In particular, ControlNet enables precise alignment between ground truth segmentation masks and the generated image content, allowing the enhancement of training datasets in segmentation tasks. This raises a key question: Can ControlNet additionally be guided to generate the most informative synthetic samples for a specific task? Inspired by active learning, where the most informative real-world samples are selected based on sample difficulty or model uncertainty, we propose the first approach to integrate active learning-based selection metrics into the backward diffusion process for sample generation. Specifically, we explore uncertainty, query by committee, and expected model change, which are commonly used in active learning, and demonstrate their application for guiding the sample generation process through gradient approximation. Our method is training-free, modifying only the backward diffusion process, allowing it to be used on any pretrained ControlNet. Using this process, we show that segmentation models trained with guided synthetic data outperform those trained on non-guided synthetic data. Our work underscores the need for advanced control mechanisms for diffusion-based models, which are not only aligned with image content but additionally downstream task performance, highlighting the true potential of synthetic data generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Image Generation with Vision Full-view Prompt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16965v3)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autoregressive (AR) image generation, models based on the 'next-token prediction' paradigm of LLMs have shown comparable performance to diffusion models by reducing inductive biases. However, directly applying LLMs to complex image generation can struggle with reconstructing the image's structure and details, impacting the generation's accuracy and stability. Additionally, the 'next-token prediction' paradigm in the AR model does not align with the contextual scanning and logical reasoning processes involved in human visual perception, limiting effective image generation. Prompt engineering, as a key technique for guiding LLMs, leverages specifically designed prompts to improve model performance on complex natural language processing (NLP) tasks, enhancing accuracy and stability of generation while maintaining contextual coherence and logical consistency, similar to human reasoning. Inspired by prompt engineering from the field of NLP, we propose Vision Full-view prompt (VF prompt) to enhance autoregressive image generation. Specifically, we design specialized image-related VF prompts for AR image generation to simulate the process of human image creation. This enhances contextual logic ability by allowing the model to first perceive overall distribution information before generating the image, and improve generation stability by increasing the inference steps. Compared to the AR method without VF prompts, our method shows outstanding performance and achieves an approximate improvement of 20%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Other Vehicle Trajectories Are Also Needed: A Driving World Model Unifies Ego-Other Vehicle Trajectories in Video Latant Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09215v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving \textbf{W}orld \textbf{M}odel named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying \textbf{E}go-\textbf{O}ther vehicle \textbf{T}rajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30\% in FID and 55\% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Incomplete Multi-view Clustering via Diffusion Contrastive Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09185v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to the common issue of missing data in multi-view datasets. The primary approach to address this challenge involves recovering the missing views before applying conventional multi-view clustering methods. Although imputation-based IMVC methods have achieved significant improvements, they still encounter notable limitations: 1) heavy reliance on paired data for training the data recovery module, which is impractical in real scenarios with high missing data rates; 2) the generated data often lacks diversity and discriminability, resulting in suboptimal clustering results. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel IMVC method called Diffusion Contrastive Generation (DCG). Motivated by the consistency between the diffusion and clustering processes, DCG learns the distribution characteristics to enhance clustering by applying forward diffusion and reverse denoising processes to intra-view data. By performing contrastive learning on a limited set of paired multi-view samples, DCG can align the generated views with the real views, facilitating accurate recovery of views across arbitrary missing view scenarios. Additionally, DCG integrates instance-level and category-level interactive learning to exploit the consistent and complementary information available in multi-view data, achieving robust and end-to-end clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

To support this novel task, we introduce a new large-scale motion dataset called PerMo (PersonaMotion), which captures the unique personas of multiple actors. We also propose a multi-modal finetuning method of a pretrained motion diffusion model called PersonaBooth. PersonaBooth addresses two main challenges: i) A significant distribution gap between the persona-focused PerMo dataset and the pretraining datasets, which lack persona-specific data, and ii) the difficulty of capturing a consistent persona from the motions vary in content (action type). To tackle the dataset distribution gap, we introduce a persona token to accept new persona features and perform multi-modal adaptation for both text and visuals during finetuning. To capture a consistent persona, we incorporate a contrastive learning technique to enhance intra-cohesion among samples with the same persona. Furthermore, we introduce a context-aware fusion mechanism to maximize the integration of persona cues from multiple input motions. PersonaBooth outperforms state-of-the-art motion style transfer methods, establishing a new benchmark for motion personalization.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Depth Any Video, a model that tackles the challenge through two key innovations. First, we develop a scalable synthetic data pipeline, capturing real-time video depth data from diverse virtual environments, yielding 40,000 video clips of 5-second duration, each with precise depth annotations. Second, we leverage the powerful priors of generative video diffusion models to handle real-world videos effectively, integrating advanced techniques such as rotary position encoding and flow matching to further enhance flexibility and efficiency. Unlike previous models, which are limited to fixed-length video sequences, our approach introduces a novel mixed-duration training strategy that handles videos of varying lengths and performs robustly across different frame rates-even on single frames. At inference, we propose a depth interpolation method that enables our model to infer high-resolution video depth across sequences of up to 150 frames. Our model outperforms all previous generative depth models in terms of spatial accuracy and temporal consistency. The code and model weights are open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://depthanyvideo.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling Concept Attribution in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02542v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable abilities in generating realistic and high-quality images from text prompts. However, a trained model remains largely black-box; little do we know about the roles of its components in exhibiting a concept such as objects or styles. Recent works employ causal tracing to localize knowledge-storing layers in generative models without showing how other layers contribute to the target concept. In this work, we approach diffusion models' interpretability problem from a more general perspective and pose a question: \textit{``How do model components work jointly to demonstrate knowledge?''}. To answer this question, we decompose diffusion models using component attribution, systematically unveiling the importance of each component (specifically the model parameter) in generating a concept. The proposed framework, called \textbf{C}omponent \textbf{A}ttribution for \textbf{D}iffusion Model (CAD), discovers the localization of concept-inducing (positive) components, while interestingly uncovers another type of components that contribute negatively to generating a concept, which is missing in the previous knowledge localization work. Based on this holistic understanding of diffusion models, we introduce two fast, inference-time model editing algorithms, CAD-Erase and CAD-Amplify; in particular, CAD-Erase enables erasure and CAD-Amplify allows amplification of a generated concept by ablating the positive and negative components, respectively, while retaining knowledge of other concepts.

| **[Light-A-Video: Training-free Video Relighting via Progressive Light Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08590v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in image relighting models, driven by large-scale datasets and pre-trained diffusion models, have enabled the imposition of consistent lighting. However, video relighting still lags, primarily due to the excessive training costs and the scarcity of diverse, high-quality video relighting datasets. A simple application of image relighting models on a frame-by-frame basis leads to several issues: lighting source inconsistency and relighted appearance inconsistency, resulting in flickers in the generated videos. In this work, we propose Light-A-Video, a training-free approach to achieve temporally smooth video relighting. Adapted from image relighting models, Light-A-Video introduces two key techniques to enhance lighting consistency. First, we design a Consistent Light Attention (CLA) module, which enhances cross-frame interactions within the self-attention layers of the image relight model to stabilize the generation of the background lighting source. Second, leveraging the physical principle of light transport independence, we apply linear blending between the source video's appearance and the relighted appearance, using a Progressive Light Fusion (PLF) strategy to ensure smooth temporal transitions in illumination. Experiments show that Light-A-Video improves the temporal consistency of relighted video while maintaining the relighted image quality, ensuring coherent lighting transitions across frames.

Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on static view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video surpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video generation. We will publicly release our code and data.

| **[Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging with Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy for Air Quality Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09646v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of sensors for air quality monitoring is constrained by high costs, leading to inadequate network coverage and data deficits in some areas. Utilizing existing observations, spatio-temporal kriging is a method for estimating air quality at unobserved locations during a specific period. Inductive spatio-temporal kriging with increment training strategy has demonstrated its effectiveness using virtual nodes to simulate unobserved nodes. However, a disparity between virtual and real nodes persists, complicating the application of learning patterns derived from virtual nodes to actual unobserved ones. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy (PGITS). Specifically, we design a dynamic graph generation module to incorporate the advection and diffusion processes of airborne particles as physical knowledge into the graph structure, dynamically adjusting the adjacency matrix to reflect physical interactions between nodes. By using physics principles as a bridge between virtual and real nodes, this strategy ensures the features of virtual nodes and their pseudo labels are closer to actual nodes. Consequently, the learned patterns of virtual nodes can be applied to actual unobserved nodes for effective kriging.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the impact of observation error correlations in data assimilation, with application to along-track altimeter data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09140v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data assimilation involves estimating the state of a system by combining observations from various sources with a background estimate of the state. The weights given to the observations and background state depend on their specified error covariance matrices. Observation errors are often assumed to be uncorrelated even though this assumption is inaccurate for many modern data-sets such as those from satellite observing systems. As methods allowing for a more realistic representation of observation-error correlations are emerging, our aim in this article is to provide insight on their expected impact in data assimilation. First, we use a simple idealised system to analyse the effect of observation-error correlations on the spectral characteristics of the solution. Next, we assess the relevance of these results in a more realistic setting in which simulated alongtrack (nadir) altimeter observations with correlated errors are assimilated in a global ocean model using a three-dimensional variational assimilation (3D-Var) method. Correlated observation errors are modelled in the 3D-Var system using a diffusion operator. When the correlation length scale of observation error is small compared to that of background error, inflating the observation-error variances can mitigate most of the negative effects from neglecting the observation-error correlations. Accounting for observation-error correlations in this situation still outperforms variance inflation since it allows small-scale information in the observations to be more effectively extracted and does not affect the convergence of the minimization. Conversely, when the correlation length scale of observation error is large compared to that of background error, the effect of observation-error correlations cannot be properly approximated with variance inflation. However, the correlation model needs to be constructed carefully to ensure the minimization problem is adequately conditioned so that a robust solution can be obtained. Practical ways to achieve this are discussed.</p></details> |  |

| **[AdvAD: Exploring Non-Parametric Diffusion for Imperceptible Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09124v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imperceptible adversarial attacks aim to fool DNNs by adding imperceptible perturbation to the input data. Previous methods typically improve the imperceptibility of attacks by integrating common attack paradigms with specifically designed perception-based losses or the capabilities of generative models. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Attacks in Diffusion (AdvAD), a novel modeling framework distinct from existing attack paradigms. AdvAD innovatively conceptualizes attacking as a non-parametric diffusion process by theoretically exploring basic modeling approach rather than using the denoising or generation abilities of regular diffusion models requiring neural networks. At each step, much subtler yet effective adversarial guidance is crafted using only the attacked model without any additional network, which gradually leads the end of diffusion process from the original image to a desired imperceptible adversarial example. Grounded in a solid theoretical foundation of the proposed non-parametric diffusion process, AdvAD achieves high attack efficacy and imperceptibility with intrinsically lower overall perturbation strength. Additionally, an enhanced version AdvAD-X is proposed to evaluate the extreme of our novel framework under an ideal scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AdvAD and AdvAD-X. Compared with state-of-the-art imperceptible attacks, AdvAD achieves an average of 99.9$\%$ (+17.3$\%$) ASR with 1.34 (-0.97) $l_2$ distance, 49.74 (+4.76) PSNR and 0.9971 (+0.0043) SSIM against four prevalent DNNs with three different architectures on the ImageNet-compatible dataset.

| **[On the Generalization Properties of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01797v4)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are a class of generative models that serve to establish a stochastic transport map between an empirically observed, yet unknown, target distribution and a known prior. Despite their remarkable success in real-world applications, a theoretical understanding of their generalization capabilities remains underdeveloped. This work embarks on a comprehensive theoretical exploration of the generalization attributes of diffusion models. We establish theoretical estimates of the generalization gap that evolves in tandem with the training dynamics of score-based diffusion models, suggesting a polynomially small generalization error ($O(n^{-2/5}+m^{-4/5})$) on both the sample size $n$ and the model capacity $m$, evading the curse of dimensionality (i.e., not exponentially large in the data dimension) when early-stopped. Furthermore, we extend our quantitative analysis to a data-dependent scenario, wherein target distributions are portrayed as a succession of densities with progressively increasing distances between modes. This precisely elucidates the adverse effect of "modes shift" in ground truths on the model generalization. Moreover, these estimates are not solely theoretical constructs but have also been confirmed through numerical simulations. Our findings contribute to the rigorous understanding of diffusion models' generalization properties and provide insights that may guide practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
| **[Training Data Provenance Verification: Did Your Model Use Synthetic Data from My Generative Model for Training?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09122v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality open-source text-to-image models have lowered the threshold for obtaining photorealistic images significantly, but also face potential risks of misuse. Specifically, suspects may use synthetic data generated by these generative models to train models for specific tasks without permission, when lacking real data resources especially. Protecting these generative models is crucial for the well-being of their owners. In this work, we propose the first method to this important yet unresolved issue, called Training data Provenance Verification (TrainProVe). The rationale behind TrainProVe is grounded in the principle of generalization error bound, which suggests that, for two models with the same task, if the distance between their training data distributions is smaller, their generalization ability will be closer. We validate the efficacy of TrainProVe across four text-to-image models (Stable Diffusion v1.4, latent consistency model, PixArt-$\alpha$, and Stable Cascade). The results show that TrainProVe achieves a verification accuracy of over 99\% in determining the provenance of suspicious model training data, surpassing all previous methods.

However, generating and understanding interactive human-like motion, where multiple individuals engage in coordinated movements, remains challenging due to the complexity of modeling these interactions. Additionally, a unified and versatile model is needed to handle diverse interactive scenarios, such as chat systems that dynamically adapt to user instructions and assigned roles. To address these challenges, we introduce VIM, the Versatile Interactive Motion-language model, which integrates both language and motion modalities to effectively understand, generate, and control interactive motions in multi-turn conversational contexts. Unlike previous studies that primarily focus on uni-directional tasks such as text-to-motion or motion-to-text, VIM employs a unified architecture capable of simultaneously understanding and generating both motion and text modalities. Given the absence of an appropriate dataset to support this task, we introduce Inter-MT2, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset containing 82.7K multi-turn interactive motion instructions, covering 153K interactive motion samples. Inter-MT2 spans diverse instructional scenarios, including motion editing, question answering, and story generation, leveraging off-the-shelf large language models and motion diffusion models to construct a broad set of interactive motion instructions. We extensively evaluate the versatility of VIM across multiple interactive motion-related tasks, including motion-to-text, text-to-motion, reaction generation, motion editing, and reasoning about motion sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://vim-motion-language.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Multi-Object Grasping with One Dexterous Hand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09078v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequentially grasping multiple objects with multi-fingered hands is common in daily life, where humans can fully leverage the dexterity of their hands to enclose multiple objects. However, the diversity of object geometries and the complex contact interactions required for high-DOF hands to grasp one object while enclosing another make sequential multi-object grasping challenging for robots. In this paper, we propose SeqMultiGrasp, a system for sequentially grasping objects with a four-fingered Allegro Hand. We focus on sequentially grasping two objects, ensuring that the hand fully encloses one object before lifting it and then grasps the second object without dropping the first. Our system first synthesizes single-object grasp candidates, where each grasp is constrained to use only a subset of the hand's links. These grasps are then validated in a physics simulator to ensure stability and feasibility. Next, we merge the validated single-object grasp poses to construct multi-object grasp configurations. For real-world deployment, we train a diffusion model conditioned on point clouds to propose grasp poses, followed by a heuristic-based execution strategy. We test our system using $8 \times 8$ object combinations in simulation and $6 \times 3$ object combinations in real. Our diffusion-based grasp model obtains an average success rate of 65.8% over 1600 simulation trials and 56.7% over 90 real-world trials, suggesting that it is a promising approach for sequential multi-object grasping with multi-fingered hands.

| **[Theoretical Guarantees for High Order Trajectory Refinement in Generative Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09069v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, offering computational advantages over diffusion models by leveraging deterministic Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) instead of stochastic dynamics. While prior work established the worst case optimality of standard flow matching under Wasserstein distances, the theoretical guarantees for higher-order flow matching - which incorporates acceleration terms to refine sample trajectories - remain unexplored. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proving that higher-order flow matching preserves worst case optimality as a distribution estimator. We derive upper bounds on the estimation error for second-order flow matching, demonstrating that the convergence rates depend polynomially on the smoothness of the target distribution (quantified via Besov spaces) and key parameters of the ODE dynamics. Our analysis employs neural network approximations with carefully controlled depth, width, and sparsity to bound acceleration errors across both small and large time intervals, ultimately unifying these results into a general worst case optimal bound for all time steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.11261</p></details> |

To resolve these trade-offs, we propose Inductive Moment Matching (IMM), a new class of generative models for one- or few-step sampling with a single-stage training procedure. Unlike distillation, IMM does not require pre-training initialization and optimization of two networks; and unlike Consistency Models, IMM guarantees distribution-level convergence and remains stable under various hyperparameters and standard model architectures. IMM surpasses diffusion models on ImageNet-256x256 with 1.99 FID using only 8 inference steps and achieves state-of-the-art 2-step FID of 1.98 on CIFAR-10 for a model trained from scratch.</p></details> |  |

SANA-Sprint is built on a pre-trained foundation model and augmented with hybrid distillation, dramatically reducing inference steps from 20 to 1-4. We introduce three key innovations: (1) We propose a training-free approach that transforms a pre-trained flow-matching model for continuous-time consistency distillation (sCM), eliminating costly training from scratch and achieving high training efficiency. Our hybrid distillation strategy combines sCM with latent adversarial distillation (LADD): sCM ensures alignment with the teacher model, while LADD enhances single-step generation fidelity. (2) SANA-Sprint is a unified step-adaptive model that achieves high-quality generation in 1-4 steps, eliminating step-specific training and improving efficiency. (3) We integrate ControlNet with SANA-Sprint for real-time interactive image generation, enabling instant visual feedback for user interaction. SANA-Sprint establishes a new Pareto frontier in speed-quality tradeoffs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.59 FID and 0.74 GenEval in only 1 step - outperforming FLUX-schnell (7.94 FID / 0.71 GenEval) while being 10x faster (0.1s vs 1.1s on H100). It also achieves 0.1s (T2I) and 0.25s (ControlNet) latency for 1024 x 1024 images on H100, and 0.31s (T2I) on an RTX 4090, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and potential for AI-powered consumer applications (AIPC).

Recent advancements in Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) have shown great promise in leveraging multi-view images generated by 2D diffusion models to extract 3D content. However, challenges remain as 2D diffusion models often struggle to produce dense images with strong multi-view consistency, and LRMs tend to amplify these inconsistencies during the 3D reconstruction process. Addressing these issues is critical for achieving high-quality and efficient 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we present CDI3D, a feed-forward framework designed for efficient, high-quality image-to-3D generation with view interpolation. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose to integrate 2D diffusion-based view interpolation into the LRM pipeline to enhance the quality and consistency of the generated mesh. Specifically, our approach introduces a Dense View Interpolation (DVI) module, which synthesizes interpolated images between main views generated by the 2D diffusion model, effectively densifying the input views with better multi-view consistency. We also design a tilt camera pose trajectory to capture views with different elevations and perspectives. Subsequently, we employ a tri-plane-based mesh reconstruction strategy to extract robust tokens from these interpolated and original views, enabling the generation of high-quality 3D meshes with superior texture and geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches across various benchmarks, producing 3D content with enhanced texture fidelity and geometric accuracy.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a new image encryption scheme using DNA encoding, snake permutation and chaotic substitution techniques that ensures robust security of the image data with reduced computational overhead. The DNA encoding and snake permutation modules ensure effective scrambling of the pixels and result in efficient diffusion in the plaintext image. For the confusion part, the chaotic substitution technique is implemented, which substitutes the pixel values chosen randomly from 3 S-boxes. Extensive security analysis validate the efficacy of the image encryption algorithm proposed in this paper and results demonstrate that the encrypted images have an ideal information entropy of 7.9895 and an almost zero correlation coefficient of -0.001660. These results indicate a high degree of randomness and no correlation in the encrypted image.</p></details> |  |

By analyzing existing cache-based methods, we observe that \textit{directly reusing adjacent-step features degrades video quality due to the loss of subtle variations}. We further perform a pioneering investigation of the acceleration potential of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and reveal significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional features within the same timestep. Capitalizing on these observations, we introduce FasterCache to substantially accelerate diffusion-based video generation. Our key contributions include a dynamic feature reuse strategy that preserves both feature distinction and temporal continuity, and CFG-Cache which optimizes the reuse of conditional and unconditional outputs to further enhance inference speed without compromising video quality. We empirically evaluate FasterCache on recent video diffusion models. Experimental results show that FasterCache can significantly accelerate video generation (\eg 1.67$\times$ speedup on Vchitect-2.0) while keeping video quality comparable to the baseline, and consistently outperform existing methods in both inference speed and video quality.</p></details> |  |

Due to their ability to handle complex data distributions and their strong model capacity, generative models can be effectively incorporated into decision-making systems by generating trajectories that guide agents toward high-reward state-action regions or intermediate sub-goals. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the application of generative models in decision-making tasks. We classify seven fundamental types of generative models: energy-based models, generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, diffusion models, generative flow networks, and autoregressive models. Regarding their applications, we categorize their functions into three main roles: controllers, modelers and optimizers, and discuss how each role contributes to decision-making. Furthermore, we examine the deployment of these models across five critical real-world decision-making scenarios. Finally, we summarize the strengths and limitations of current approaches and propose three key directions for advancing next-generation generative directive models: high-performance algorithms, large-scale generalized decision-making models, and self-evolving and adaptive models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page:https://github.com/xyshao23/Awesome-Generative-Models-for-Decision-Making-Taxonomy</p></details> |
| **[Two Simple Principles for Diffusion-Based Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05274v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based test-time adaptations (TTA) have shown great advances, which leverage a diffusion model to map the images in the unknown test domain to the training domain. The unseen and diverse test domains make diffusion-based TTA an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we unravel two simple principles of the design tricks for diffusion-based methods. Intuitively, \textit{Principle 1} says semantic similarity preserving. We should preserve the semantic similarity between the original and generated test images. \textit{Principle 2} suggests minimal modifications. This principle enables the diffusion to map the test images to the training domain with minimal modifications of the test images. In particular, following the two principles, we propose our simple yet effective principle-guided diffusion-based test-time adaptation method (PDDA). Concretely, following Principle 1, we propose a semantic keeper, the method to preserve feature similarity, where the semantic keeper could filter the corruption introduced from the test domain, thus better preserving the semantics. Following Principle 2, we propose a modification keeper, where we introduce a regularization constraint into the generative process to minimize modifications to the test image. Meanwhile, there is a hidden conflict between the two principles. We further introduce the gradient-based view to unify the direction generated from two principles. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-W, and ImageNet-C with WideResNet-28-10, ResNet-50, Swin-T, and ConvNext-T demonstrate that PDDA significantly performs better than the complex state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, PDDA achieves 2.4\% average accuracy improvements in ImageNet-C without any training process.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel image compression framework, Semantically Disentangled Image Compression (SEDIC) in this paper. Our proposed SEDIC leverages large multimodal models (LMMs) to disentangle the image into several essential semantic information, including an extremely compressed reference image, overall and object-level text descriptions, and the semantic masks. A multi-stage semantic decoder is designed to progressively restore the transmitted reference image object-by-object, ultimately producing high-quality and perceptually consistent reconstructions. In each decoding stage, a pre-trained controllable diffusion model is utilized to restore the object details on the reference image conditioned by the text descriptions and semantic masks. Experimental results demonstrate that SEDIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior perceptual quality and semantic consistency at ultra-low bitrates ($\le$ 0.05 bpp).</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Anything: Any to Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06955v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional motion generation has been extensively studied in computer vision, yet two critical challenges remain. First, while masked autoregressive methods have recently outperformed diffusion-based approaches, existing masking models lack a mechanism to prioritize dynamic frames and body parts based on given conditions. Second, existing methods for different conditioning modalities often fail to integrate multiple modalities effectively, limiting control and coherence in generated motion. To address these challenges, we propose Motion Anything, a multimodal motion generation framework that introduces an Attention-based Mask Modeling approach, enabling fine-grained spatial and temporal control over key frames and actions. Our model adaptively encodes multimodal conditions, including text and music, improving controllability. Additionally, we introduce Text-Music-Dance (TMD), a new motion dataset consisting of 2,153 pairs of text, music, and dance, making it twice the size of AIST++, thereby filling a critical gap in the community. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Motion Anything surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, achieving a 15% improvement in FID on HumanML3D and showing consistent performance gains on AIST++ and TMD.

Commonly used publicly-available AD datasets typically contain large amounts of car and vehicle object instances but a low number of cyclist instances, usually with limited appearance and pose diversity. This cyclist training data scarcity problem not only limits the generalization of deep-learning perception models for cyclist semantic segmentation, pose estimation, and cyclist crossing intention prediction, but also limits research on new cyclist-related tasks such as fine-grained cyclist pose estimation and spatio-temporal analysis under complex interactions between humans and articulated objects. To address this data scarcity problem, in this paper we propose a framework to generate synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist data assets that can be used to generate training data for different tasks. In our framework, we designed a methodology for creating a new part-based multi-view articulated synthetic 3D bicycle dataset that we call 3DArticBikes that we use to train a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based reconstruction and image rendering method. We then propose a parametric bicycle 3DGS composition model to assemble 8-DoF pose-controllable 3D bicycles. Finally, using dynamic information from cyclist videos, we build a complete synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist (rider pedaling a bicycle) by re-posing a selectable synthetic 3D person, while automatically placing the rider onto one of our new articulated 3D bicycles using a proposed 3D Keypoint optimization-based Inverse Kinematics pose refinement. We present both, qualitative and quantitative results where we compare our generated cyclists against those from a recent stable diffusion-based method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthio: Augmenting Small-Scale Audio Classification Datasets with Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02056v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Synthio, a novel approach for augmenting small-scale audio classification datasets with synthetic data. Our goal is to improve audio classification accuracy with limited labeled data. Traditional data augmentation techniques, which apply artificial transformations (e.g., adding random noise or masking segments), struggle to create data that captures the true diversity present in real-world audios. To address this shortcoming, we propose to augment the dataset with synthetic audio generated from text-to-audio (T2A) diffusion models. However, synthesizing effective augmentations is challenging because not only should the generated data be acoustically consistent with the underlying small-scale dataset, but they should also have sufficient compositional diversity. To overcome the first challenge, we align the generations of the T2A model with the small-scale dataset using preference optimization. This ensures that the acoustic characteristics of the generated data remain consistent with the small-scale dataset. To address the second challenge, we propose a novel caption generation technique that leverages the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models to (1) generate diverse and meaningful audio captions and (2) iteratively refine their quality. The generated captions are then used to prompt the aligned T2A model. We extensively evaluate Synthio on ten datasets and four simulated limited-data settings. Results indicate our method consistently outperforms all baselines by 0.1%-39% using a T2A model trained only on weakly-captioned AudioSet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

| **[Identity Preserving Latent Diffusion for Brain Aging Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09634v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structural and appearance changes in brain imaging over time are crucial indicators of neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. The rapid advancement of large-scale generative models provides a promising backbone for modeling these complex global and local changes in brain images, such as transforming the age of a source image to a target age. However, current generative models, typically trained on independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data, may struggle to maintain intra-subject spatiotemporal consistency during transformations. We propose the Identity-Preserving Longitudinal Diffusion Model (IP-LDM), designed to accurately transform brain ages while preserving subject identity. Our approach involves first extracting the identity representation from the source image. Then, conditioned on the target age, the latent diffusion model learns to generate the age-transformed target image. To ensure consistency within the same subject over time, we regularize the identity representation using a triplet contrastive formulation. Our experiments on both elderly and infant brain datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing conditional generative models, producing realistic age transformations while preserving intra-subject identity.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[FP3: A 3D Foundation Policy for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08950v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following its success in natural language processing and computer vision, foundation models that are pre-trained on large-scale multi-task datasets have also shown great potential in robotics. However, most existing robot foundation models rely solely on 2D image observations, ignoring 3D geometric information, which is essential for robots to perceive and reason about the 3D world. In this paper, we introduce FP3, a first large-scale 3D foundation policy model for robotic manipulation. FP3 builds on a scalable diffusion transformer architecture and is pre-trained on 60k trajectories with point cloud observations. With the model design and diverse pre-training data, FP3 can be efficiently fine-tuned for downstream tasks while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities. Experiments on real robots demonstrate that with only 80 demonstrations, FP3 is able to learn a new task with over 90% success rates in novel environments with unseen objects, significantly surpassing existing robot foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://3d-foundation-policy.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Reconstruct Anything Model: a lightweight foundation model for computational imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08915v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing learning-based methods for solving imaging inverse problems can be roughly divided into two classes: iterative algorithms, such as plug-and-play and diffusion methods, that leverage pretrained denoisers, and unrolled architectures that are trained end-to-end for specific imaging problems. Iterative methods in the first class are computationally costly and often provide suboptimal reconstruction performance, whereas unrolled architectures are generally specific to a single inverse problem and require expensive training. In this work, we propose a novel non-iterative, lightweight architecture that incorporates knowledge about the forward operator (acquisition physics and noise parameters) without relying on unrolling. Our model is trained to solve a wide range of inverse problems beyond denoising, including deblurring, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, inpainting, and super-resolution. The proposed model can be easily adapted to unseen inverse problems or datasets with a few fine-tuning steps (up to a few images) in a self-supervised way, without ground-truth references. Throughout a series of experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance from medical imaging to low-photon imaging and microscopy.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAViD: Modeling Dynamic Affordance of 3D Objects using Pre-trained Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08333v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling how humans interact with objects is crucial for AI to effectively assist or mimic human behaviors. Existing studies for learning such ability primarily focus on static human-object interaction (HOI) patterns, such as contact and spatial relationships, while dynamic HOI patterns, capturing the movement of humans and objects over time, remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel framework for learning Dynamic Affordance across various target object categories. To address the scarcity of 4D HOI datasets, our method learns the 3D dynamic affordance from synthetically generated 4D HOI samples. Specifically, we propose a pipeline that first generates 2D HOI videos from a given 3D target object using a pre-trained video diffusion model, then lifts them into 3D to generate 4D HOI samples. Leveraging these synthesized 4D HOI samples, we train DAViD, our generative 4D human-object interaction model, which is composed of two key components: (1) a human motion diffusion model (MDM) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to fine-tune a pre-trained MDM to learn the HOI motion concepts from limited HOI motion samples, (2) a motion diffusion model for 4D object poses conditioned by produced human interaction motions. Interestingly, DAViD can integrate newly learned HOI motion concepts with pre-trained human motions to create novel HOI motions, even for multiple HOI motion concepts, demonstrating the advantage of our pipeline with LoRA in integrating dynamic HOI concepts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DAViD outperforms baselines in synthesizing HOI motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://snuvclab.github.io/david/</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Fine-Tuning and Concept Suppression for Pruned Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15341v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion generative models have yielded remarkable progress. While the quality of generated content continues to improve, these models have grown considerably in size and complexity. This increasing computational burden poses significant challenges, particularly in resource-constrained deployment scenarios such as mobile devices. The combination of model pruning and knowledge distillation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce computational demands while preserving generation quality. However, this technique inadvertently propagates undesirable behaviors, including the generation of copyrighted content and unsafe concepts, even when such instances are absent from the fine-tuning dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel bilevel optimization framework for pruned diffusion models that consolidates the fine-tuning and unlearning processes into a unified phase. Our approach maintains the principal advantages of distillation-namely, efficient convergence and style transfer capabilities-while selectively suppressing the generation of unwanted content. This plug-in framework is compatible with various pruning and concept unlearning methods, facilitating efficient, safe deployment of diffusion models in controlled environments.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Adaptive Anomaly Recovery for Telemanipulation: A Diffusion Model Approach to Vision-Based Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09632v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous telemanipulation critically relies on the continuous and stable tracking of the human operator's commands to ensure robust operation. Vison-based tracking methods are widely used but have low stability due to anomalies such as occlusions, inadequate lighting, and loss of sight. Traditional filtering, regression, and interpolation methods are commonly used to compensate for explicit information such as angles and positions. These approaches are restricted to low-dimensional data and often result in information loss compared to the original high-dimensional image and video data. Recent advances in diffusion-based approaches, which can operate on high-dimensional data, have achieved remarkable success in video reconstruction and generation. However, these methods have not been fully explored in continuous control tasks in robotics. This work introduces the Diffusion-Enhanced Telemanipulation (DET) framework, which incorporates the Frame-Difference Detection (FDD) technique to identify and segment anomalies in video streams. These anomalous clips are replaced after reconstruction using diffusion models, ensuring robust telemanipulation performance under challenging visual conditions. We validated this approach in various anomaly scenarios and compared it with the baseline methods. Experiments show that DET achieves an average RMSE reduction of 17.2% compared to the cubic spline and 51.1% compared to FFT-based interpolation for different occlusion durations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Voltage-Controlled Magnetoelectric Devices for Neuromorphic Diffusion Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12261v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic diffusion processes are pervasive in nature, from the seemingly erratic Brownian motion to the complex interactions of synaptically-coupled spiking neurons. Recently, drawing inspiration from Langevin dynamics, neuromorphic diffusion models were proposed and have become one of the major breakthroughs in the field of generative artificial intelligence. Unlike discriminative models that have been well developed to tackle classification or regression tasks, diffusion models as well as other generative models such as ChatGPT aim at creating content based upon contexts learned. However, the more complex algorithms of these models result in high computational costs using today's technologies, creating a bottleneck in their efficiency, and impeding further development. Here, we develop a spintronic voltage-controlled magnetoelectric memory hardware for the neuromorphic diffusion process. The in-memory computing capability of our spintronic devices goes beyond current Von Neumann architecture, where memory and computing units are separated. Together with the non-volatility of magnetic memory, we can achieve high-speed and low-cost computing, which is desirable for the increasing scale of generative models in the current era. We experimentally demonstrate that the hardware-based true random diffusion process can be implemented for image generation and achieve comparable image quality to software-based training as measured by the Frechet inception distance (FID) score, achieving ~10^3 better energy-per-bit-per-area over traditional hardware.</p></details> |  |
