| **[A modified Cayley transform for SU(3) molecular dynamics simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11337v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a modification to the Cayley transform that defines a suitable local parameterization for the special unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(3)$. The new mapping is used to construct splitting methods for separable Hamiltonian systems whose phase space is the cotangent bundle of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ or, more general, $\mathrm{SU(3)}^N$, $N \in \mathbb{N}$. Special attention is given to the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm for gauge field generation in lattice quantum chromodynamics. We show that the use of the modified Cayley transform instead of the matrix exponential neither affects the time-reversibility nor the volume-preservation of the splitting method. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of the Cayley-based algorithms are discussed and illustrated in pure gauge field simulations.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Generative flow-based warm start of the variational quantum eigensolver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01726v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) show promise for quantum simulations on near-term quantum devices, but are often limited by complex objective functions and expensive optimization procedures. Here, we propose Flow-VQE, a generative framework leveraging conditional normalizing flows with parameterized quantum circuits to efficiently generate high-quality variational parameters. By embedding a generative model into the VQE optimization loop through preference-based training, Flow-VQE enables quantum gradient-free optimization and offers a systematic approach for parameter transfer, accelerating convergence across related problems through warm-started optimization. We compare Flow-VQE to a number of standard benchmarks through numerical simulations on molecular systems, including hydrogen chains, water, ammonia, and benzene. We find that Flow-VQE outperforms baseline optimization algorithms, achieving computational accuracy with fewer circuit evaluations (improvements range from modest to more than two orders of magnitude) and, when used to warm-start the optimization of new systems, accelerates subsequent fine-tuning by up to 50-fold compared with Hartree--Fock initialization. Therefore, we believe Flow-VQE can become a pragmatic and versatile paradigm for leveraging generative modeling to reduce the costs of variational quantum algorithms.</p></details> | 20 pages; 8 figures |
| **[Symbolic identification of tensor equations in multidimensional physical fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01466v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, data-driven methods have shown great promise for discovering governing equations from simulation or experimental data. However, most existing approaches are limited to scalar equations, with few capable of identifying tensor relationships. In this work, we propose a general data-driven framework for identifying tensor equations, referred to as Symbolic Identification of Tensor Equations (SITE). The core idea of SITE--representing tensor equations using a host-plasmid structure--is inspired by the multidimensional gene expression programming (M-GEP) approach. To improve the robustness of the evolutionary process, SITE adopts a genetic information retention strategy. Moreover, SITE introduces two key innovations beyond conventional evolutionary algorithms. First, it incorporates a dimensional homogeneity check to restrict the search space and eliminate physically invalid expressions. Second, it replaces traditional linear scaling with a tensor linear regression technique, greatly enhancing the efficiency of numerical coefficient optimization. We validate SITE using two benchmark scenarios, where it accurately recovers target equations from synthetic data, showing robustness to noise and small sample sizes. Furthermore, SITE is applied to identify constitutive relations directly from molecular simulation data, which are generated without reliance on macroscopic constitutive models. It adapts to both compressible and incompressible flow conditions and successfully identifies the corresponding macroscopic forms, highlighting its potential for data-driven discovery of tensor equation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Drug Discovery SMILES-to-Pharmacokinetics Diffusion Models with Deep Molecular Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07636v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in every stage of drug development. One challenge facing drug discovery AI is that drug pharmacokinetic (PK) datasets are often collected independently from each other, often with limited overlap, creating data overlap sparsity. Data sparsity makes data curation difficult for researchers looking to answer research questions in poly-pharmacy, drug combination research, and high-throughput screening. We propose Imagand, a novel SMILES-to-Pharmacokinetic (S2PK) diffusion model capable of generating an array of PK target properties conditioned on SMILES inputs. We show that Imagand-generated synthetic PK data closely resembles real data univariate and bivariate distributions, and improves performance for downstream tasks. Imagand is a promising solution for data overlap sparsity and allows researchers to efficiently generate ligand PK data for drug discovery research. Code is available at https://github.com/bing1100/Imagand.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

| **[TABASCO: A Fast, Simplified Model for Molecular Generation with Improved Physical Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00899v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art models for 3D molecular generation are based on significant inductive biases, SE(3), permutation equivariance to respect symmetry and graph message-passing networks to capture local chemistry, yet the generated molecules still struggle with physical plausibility. We introduce TABASCO which relaxes these assumptions: The model has a standard non-equivariant transformer architecture, treats atoms in a molecule as sequences and reconstructs bonds deterministically after generation. The absence of equivariant layers and message passing allows us to significantly simplify the model architecture and scale data throughput. On the GEOM-Drugs benchmark TABASCO achieves state-of-the-art PoseBusters validity and delivers inference roughly 10x faster than the strongest baseline, while exhibiting emergent rotational equivariance despite symmetry not being hard-coded. Our work offers a blueprint for training minimalist, high-throughput generative models suited to specialised tasks such as structure- and pharmacophore-based drug design. We provide a link to our implementation at github.com/carlosinator/tabasco.</p></details> |  |
| **[SegAnyPET: Universal Promptable Segmentation from Positron Emission Tomography Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14351v3)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a powerful molecular imaging tool that plays a crucial role in modern medical diagnostics by visualizing radio-tracer distribution to reveal physiological processes. Accurate organ segmentation from PET images is essential for comprehensive multi-systemic analysis of interactions between different organs and pathologies. Existing segmentation methods are limited by insufficient annotation data and varying levels of annotation, resulting in weak generalization ability and difficulty in clinical application. Recent developments in segmentation foundation models have shown superior versatility across diverse segmentation tasks. Despite the efforts of medical adaptations, these works primarily focus on structural medical images with detailed physiological structural information and exhibit limited generalization performance on molecular PET imaging. In this paper, we collect and construct PETS-5k, the largest PET segmentation dataset to date, comprising 5,731 three-dimensional whole-body PET images and encompassing over 1.3M 2D images. Based on the established dataset, we develop SegAnyPET, a modality-specific 3D foundation model for universal promptable segmentation from PET images. To issue the challenge of discrepant annotation quality, we adopt a cross prompting confident learning (CPCL) strategy with an uncertainty-guided self-rectification process to robustly learn segmentation from high-quality labeled data and low-quality noisy labeled data for promptable segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that SegAnyPET can segment seen and unseen target organs using only one or a few prompt points, outperforming state-of-the-art foundation models and task-specific fully supervised models with higher accuracy and strong generalization ability for universal segmentation.</p></details> | Accept for ICCV 2025 |
| **[Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Sampler](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22565v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational methods for learning to sample from the Boltzmann distribution -- where the target distribution is known only up to an unnormalized energy function -- have advanced significantly recently. Due to the lack of explicit target samples, however, prior diffusion-based methods, known as diffusion samplers, often require importance-weighted estimation or complicated learning processes. Both trade off scalability with extensive evaluations of the energy and model, thereby limiting their practical usage. In this work, we propose Adjoint Schr\"odinger Bridge Sampler (ASBS), a new diffusion sampler that employs simple and scalable matching-based objectives yet without the need to estimate target samples during training. ASBS is grounded on a mathematical model -- the Schr\"odinger Bridge -- which enhances sampling efficiency via kinetic-optimal transportation. Through a new lens of stochastic optimal control theory, we demonstrate how SB-based diffusion samplers can be learned at scale via Adjoint Matching and prove convergence to the global solution. Notably, ASBS generalizes the recent Adjoint Sampling (Havens et al., 2025) to arbitrary source distributions by relaxing the so-called memoryless condition that largely restricts the design space. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ASBS on sampling from classical energy functions, amortized conformer generation, and molecular Boltzmann distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diverse Mini-Batch Selection in Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Chemical Exploration in de novo Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21158v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations, in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment (i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps. Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.</p></details> |  |
| **[A standard transformer and attention with linear biases for molecular conformer generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19834v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling low-energy molecular conformations, spatial arrangements of atoms in a molecule, is a critical task for many different calculations performed in the drug discovery and optimization process. Numerous specialized equivariant networks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D molecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as a viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve generalization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models require a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this paper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively addresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating relative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million parameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model with 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative positional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with the shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different attention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional encoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to serve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular conformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revision of paper at OpenReview: https://openreview.net/forum?id=BjjerMYL3F</p></details> |
| **[Controlled Generation with Equivariant Variational Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18340v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models, or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Bad Molecules: Are MLLMs Ready for Structure-Level Molecular Detoxification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10912v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure. Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sampling 3D Molecular Conformers with Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15378v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative modeling of molecular structures.

| **[Reimagining Target-Aware Molecular Generation through Retrieval-Enhanced Aligned Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14488v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Breakthroughs in high-accuracy protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have established receptor-based molecule design as a critical driver for rapid early-phase drug discovery. However, most approaches still struggle to balance pocket-specific geometric fit with strict valence and synthetic constraints. To resolve this trade-off, a Retrieval-Enhanced Aligned Diffusion termed READ is introduced, which is the first to merge molecular Retrieval-Augmented Generation with an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model. Specifically, a contrastively pre-trained encoder aligns atom-level representations during training, then retrieves graph embeddings of pocket-matched scaffolds to guide each reverse-diffusion step at inference. This single mechanism can inject real-world chemical priors exactly where needed, producing valid, diverse, and shape-complementary ligands. Experimental results demonstrate that READ can achieve very competitive performance in CBGBench, surpassing state-of-the-art generative models and even native ligands. That suggests retrieval and diffusion can be co-optimized for faster, more reliable structure-based drug design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Rao-Blackwell Gradient Estimators for Equivariant Denoising Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09890v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In domains such as molecular and protein generation, physical systems exhibit inherent symmetries that are critical to model. Two main strategies have emerged for learning invariant distributions: designing equivariant network architectures and using data augmentation to approximate equivariance. While equivariant architectures preserve symmetry by design, they often involve greater complexity and pose optimization challenges. Data augmentation, on the other hand, offers flexibility but may fall short in fully capturing symmetries. Our framework enhances both approaches by reducing training variance and providing a provably lower-variance gradient estimator. We achieve this by interpreting data augmentation as a Monte Carlo estimator of the training gradient and applying Rao-Blackwellization. This leads to more stable optimization, faster convergence, and reduced variance, all while requiring only a single forward and backward pass per sample. We also present a practical implementation of this estimator incorporating the loss and sampling procedure through a method we call Orbit Diffusion. Theoretically, we guarantee that our loss admits equivariant minimizers. Empirically, Orbit Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art results on GEOM-QM9 for molecular conformation generation, improves crystal structure prediction, and advances text-guided crystal generation on the Perov-5 and MP-20 benchmarks. Additionally, it enhances protein designability in protein structure generation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Graph-Based Deep Learning for Component Segmentation of Maize Plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00182v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In precision agriculture, one of the most important tasks when exploring crop production is identifying individual plant components. There are several attempts to accomplish this task by the use of traditional 2D imaging, 3D reconstructions, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, they have several drawbacks when processing 3D data and identifying individual plant components. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning architecture to detect components of individual plants on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) 3D Point Cloud (PC) data sets. This architecture is based on the concept of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and feature enhancing with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, each point is taken as a vertex and by the use of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) layer, the edges are established, thus representing the 3D PC data set. Subsequently, Edge-Conv layers are used to further increase the features of each point. Finally, Graph Attention Networks (GAT) are applied to classify visible phenotypic components of the plant, such as the leaf, stem, and soil. This study demonstrates that our graph-based deep learning approach enhances segmentation accuracy for identifying individual plant components, achieving percentages above 80% in the IoU average, thus outperforming other existing models based on point clouds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Power Control and Precoding for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems With Sparse Multi-Dimensional Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01876v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO) has emerged as a prominent candidate for future networks due to its ability to significantly enhance spectral efficiency by eliminating inter-cell interference. However, its practical deployment faces considerable challenges, such as high computational complexity and the optimization of its complex processing. To address these challenges, this correspondence proposes a framework based on a sparse multi-dimensional graph neural network (SP-MDGNN), which sparsifies the connections between access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs) to significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining high performance. In addition, the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm is introduced as a comparative method to further analyze the trade-off between performance and complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the sparse method achieves an optimal balance between performance and complexity, significantly reducing the computational complexity of the original MDGNN method while incurring only a slight performance degradation, providing insights for the practical deployment of CF mMIMO systems in large-scale network.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MILP-SAT-GNN: Yet Another Neural SAT Solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01825v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We proposes a novel method that enables Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to solve SAT problems by leveraging a technique developed for applying GNNs to Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Specifically, k-CNF formulae are mapped into MILP problems, which are then encoded as weighted bipartite graphs and subsequently fed into a GNN for training and testing. From a theoretical perspective: (i) we establish permutation and equivalence invariance results, demonstrating that the method produces outputs that are stable under reordering of clauses and variables; (ii) we identify a theoretical limitation, showing that for a class of formulae called foldable formulae, standard GNNs cannot always distinguish satisfiable from unsatisfiable instances; (iii) we prove a universal approximation theorem, establishing that with Random Node Initialization (RNI), the method can approximate SAT solving to arbitrary precision on finite datasets, that is, the GNN becomes approximately sound and complete on such datasets. Furthermore, we show that for unfoldable formulae, the same approximation guarantee can be achieved without the need for RNI. Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation of our approach, which show that, despite the simplicity of the neural architecture, the method achieves promising results.</p></details> |  |

Uncertainty can also be used in critical applications to verify the results of the model by an expert or additional models. In this paper, we propose Variational Neural Network versions of spatial and spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Networks. We estimate uncertainty in both outputs and layer-wise attentions of the models, which has the potential for improving model explainability. We showcase the benefits of these models in the social trading analysis and the skeleton-based human action recognition tasks on the Finnish board membership, NTU-60, NTU-120 and Kinetics datasets, where we show improvement in model accuracy in addition to estimated model uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. 9 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Vehicle-group-based Crash Risk Prediction and Interpretation on Highways](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12415v3)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies in predicting crash risks primarily associated the number or likelihood of crashes on a road segment with traffic parameters or geometric characteristics, usually neglecting the impact of vehicles' continuous movement and interactions with nearby vehicles. Recent technology advances, such as Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are able to collect high-resolution trajectory data, which enables trajectory-based risk analysis. This study investigates a new vehicle group (VG) based risk analysis method and explores risk evolution mechanisms considering VG features. An impact-based vehicle grouping method is proposed to cluster vehicles into VGs by evaluating their responses to the erratic behaviors of nearby vehicles. The risk of a VG is aggregated based on the risk between each vehicle pair in the VG, measured by inverse Time-to-Collision (iTTC). A Logistic Regression and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) are then employed to predict VG risks using aggregated and disaggregated VG information. Both methods achieve excellent performance with AUC values exceeding 0.93. For the GNN model, GNNExplainer with feature perturbation is applied to identify critical individual vehicle features and their directional impact on VG risks. Overall, this research contributes a new perspective for identifying, predicting, and interpreting traffic risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and published in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, vol. 26, no. 6, pp. 7807-7818, June 2025.

However, existing lidar and camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in visually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data processing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer a cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging regardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers from sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this work, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph neural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in complex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the low-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such resource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources. We evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and autonomous navigation, in three different environments. Our results demonstrate strong reliability and generalizability, making RaGNNarok a robust solution for low-cost indoor mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream visuomotor tasks.

| **[Understanding Generalization in Node and Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00927v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) for node and link prediction is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, which has led to the development of diverse MPNN architectures. Besides working well in practical settings, their ability to generalize beyond the training set remains poorly understood. While some studies have explored MPNNs' generalization in graph-level prediction tasks, much less attention has been given to node- and link-level predictions. Existing works often rely on unrealistic i.i.d.\@ assumptions, overlooking possible correlations between nodes or links, and assuming fixed aggregation and impractical loss functions while neglecting the influence of graph structure. In this work, we introduce a unified framework to analyze the generalization properties of MPNNs in inductive and transductive node and link prediction settings, incorporating diverse architectural parameters and loss functions and quantifying the influence of graph structure. Additionally, our proposed generalization framework can be applied beyond graphs to any classification task under the inductive or transductive setting. Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, deepening our understanding of MPNNs' generalization capabilities in these tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.07106</p></details> |

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformers have shown promising performance in representing neural architectures. However, each of both methods has its disadvantages. GNNs lack the capabilities to represent complicated features, while transformers face poor generalization when the depth of architecture grows. To mitigate the above issues, we rethink neural architecture topology and show that sibling nodes are pivotal while overlooked in previous research. We thus propose a novel predictor leveraging the strengths of GNNs and transformers to learn the enhanced topology. We introduce a novel token mixer that considers siblings, and a new channel mixer named bidirectional graph isomorphism feed-forward network. Our approach consistently achieves promising performance in both accuracy and latency prediction, providing valuable insights for learning Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology.

| **[Studying and Improving Graph Neural Network-based Motif Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15709v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript represents a revised version from the paper on https://openreview.net/forum?id=PZVVOeu6xx.

Road network data can be used to reduce the impact of these errors and enhance the accuracy of a positioning system. Previous works employing road network data are either limited to offline applications, or rely on Kalman Filter (KF) heuristics with little flexibility and robustness. We instead propose training a Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN) to integrate road network information into a KF. The TGNN is designed to predict the correct road segment and its associated uncertainty to be used in the measurement update step of the KF. We validate our approach with real-world GNSS data and open-source road networks, observing a 29% decrease in positioning error for challenging scenarios compared to a GNSS-only KF. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first deep learning-based approach jointly employing road network data and GNSS measurements to determine the user position on Earth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 workshop ML4Wireless</p></details> |
| **[Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00647v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sheaf diffusion has recently emerged as a promising design pattern for graph representation learning due to its inherent ability to handle heterophilic data and avoid oversmoothing. Meanwhile, cooperative message passing has also been proposed as a way to enhance the flexibility of information diffusion by allowing nodes to independently choose whether to propagate/gather information from/to neighbors. A natural question ensues: is sheaf diffusion capable of exhibiting this cooperative behavior? Here, we provide a negative answer to this question. In particular, we show that existing sheaf diffusion methods fail to achieve cooperative behavior due to the lack of message directionality. To circumvent this limitation, we introduce the notion of cellular sheaves over directed graphs and characterize their in- and out-degree Laplacians. We leverage our construction to propose Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs). Theoretically, we characterize the receptive field of CSNN and show it allows nodes to selectively attend (listen) to arbitrarily far nodes while ignoring all others in their path, potentially mitigating oversquashing. Our experiments show that CSNN presents overall better performance compared to prior art on sheaf diffusion as well as cooperative graph neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rotational Sampling: A Plug-and-Play Encoder for Rotation-Invariant 3D Molecular GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01073v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in molecular property prediction. However, traditional graph representations struggle to effectively encode the inherent 3D spatial structures of molecules, as molecular orientations in 3D space introduce significant variability, severely limiting model generalization and robustness. Existing approaches primarily focus on rotation-invariant and rotation-equivariant methods. Invariant methods often rely heavily on prior knowledge and lack sufficient generalizability, while equivariant methods suffer from high computational costs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel plug-and-play 3D encoding module leveraging rotational sampling. By computing the expectation over the SO(3) rotational group, the method naturally achieves approximate rotational invariance. Furthermore, by introducing a carefully designed post-alignment strategy, strict invariance can be achieved without compromising performance. Experimental evaluations on the QM9 and C10 Datasets demonstrate superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, the proposed approach maintains low computational complexity and enhanced interpretability, providing a promising direction for efficient and effective handling of 3D molecular information in drug discovery and material design.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Automatic Graph Construction Framework based on Large Language Models for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18241v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art methods to learn from graph-structured data for recommendation. However, most existing GNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures and learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance of the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually rely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or too labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs) to automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world knowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally suffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking contextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we introduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs for recommendation. Specifically, we first use LLMs to infer the user preference and item knowledge, which is encoded as semantic vectors. Next, we employ vector quantization to extract the latent factors from the semantic vectors. The latent factors are then incorporated as extra nodes to link the user/item nodes, resulting in a graph with in-depth global-view semantics. We further design metapath-based message aggregation to effectively aggregate the semantic and collaborative information. The framework is model-agnostic and compatible with different backbone models. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and efffciency of AutoGraph compared to existing baseline methods. We have deployed AutoGraph in Huawei advertising platform, and gain a 2.69% improvement on RPM and a 7.31% improvement on eCPM in the online A/B test. Currently AutoGraph has been used as the main trafffc model, serving hundreds of millions of people.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD'25 |
| **[A Recipe for Causal Graph Regression: Confounding Effects Revisited](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00440v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Through recognizing causal subgraphs, causal graph learning (CGL) has risen to be a promising approach for improving the generalizability of graph neural networks under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. However, the empirical successes of CGL techniques are mostly exemplified in classification settings, while regression tasks, a more challenging setting in graph learning, are overlooked. We thus devote this work to tackling causal graph regression (CGR); to this end we reshape the processing of confounding effects in existing CGL studies, which mainly deal with classification. Specifically, we reflect on the predictive power of confounders in graph-level regression, and generalize classification-specific causal intervention techniques to regression through a lens of contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on graph OOD benchmarks validate the efficacy of our proposals for CGR. The model implementation and the code are provided on https://github.com/causal-graph/CGR.</p></details> | ICML 2025 accepted |
| **[Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17064v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (main text), 4 figures, 2 tables.

Yet, theoretical understanding of their expressive power has focused almost entirely on graph-level representations. In this work, we shift the focus to links and provide the first comprehensive study of GNN expressiveness in link representation. We introduce a unifying framework, the $k_\phi$-$k_\rho$-$m$ framework, that subsumes existing message-passing link models and enables formal expressiveness comparisons. Using this framework, we derive a hierarchy of state-of-the-art methods and offer theoretical tools to analyze future architectures. To complement our analysis, we propose a synthetic evaluation protocol comprising the first benchmark specifically designed to assess link-level expressiveness. Finally, we ask: does expressiveness matter in practice? We use a graph symmetry metric that quantifies the difficulty of distinguishing links and show that while expressive models may underperform on standard benchmarks, they significantly outperform simpler ones as symmetry increases, highlighting the need for dataset-aware model selection.</p></details> |  |

| **[AC-DiT: Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer for Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01961v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling language-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing methods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator, primarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly model the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily leads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand, they treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual observation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct multimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile manipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination for end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base directly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body conditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion representations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body actions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact of the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at different stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware multimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights between various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features tailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for example, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial for action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric information when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreeMorph: Tuning-Free Generalized Image Morphing with Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01953v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present FreeMorph, the first tuning-free method for image morphing that accommodates inputs with different semantics or layouts. Unlike existing methods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by time constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers high-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

| **[Reasoning to Edit: Hypothetical Instruction-Based Image Editing with Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01908v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting, moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities. Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis, incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our dataset and code will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[FramePrompt: In-context Controllable Animation with Zero Structural Changes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17301v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating controllable character animation from a reference image and motion guidance remains a challenging task due to the inherent difficulty of injecting appearance and motion cues into video diffusion models. Prior works often rely on complex architectures, explicit guider modules, or multi-stage processing pipelines, which increase structural overhead and hinder deployment. Inspired by the strong visual context modeling capacity of pre-trained video diffusion transformers, we propose FramePrompt, a minimalist yet powerful framework that treats reference images, skeleton-guided motion, and target video clips as a unified visual sequence. By reformulating animation as a conditional future prediction task, we bypass the need for guider networks and structural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms representative baselines across various evaluation metrics while also simplifying training. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of sequence-level visual conditioning and demonstrate the potential of pre-trained models for controllable animation without architectural changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://frameprompt.github.io/</p></details> |

This survey provides a comprehensive review and critical analysis of GenAI in network optimization. We focus on the two dominant paradigms of GenAI including generative diffusion models (GDMs) and large pre-trained models (LPTMs), and organize our discussion around a categorization we introduce, dividing network optimization problems into two primary formulations: one-shot optimization and Markov decision process (MDP). We first trace key works, including foundational contributions from the AI community, and categorize current efforts in network optimization. We also review frontier applications of GDMs and LPTMs in other networking tasks, providing additional context. Furthermore, we present theoretical generalization bounds for GDMs in both one-shot and MDP settings, offering insights into the fundamental factors affecting model performance. Most importantly, we reflect on the overestimated perception of GenAI's general capabilities and caution against the all-in-one illusion it may convey. We highlight critical limitations, including difficulties in constraint satisfying, limited concept understanding, and the inherent probabilistic nature of outputs. We also propose key future directions, such as bridging the gap between generation and optimization. Although they are increasingly integrated in implementations, they differ fundamentally in both objectives and underlying mechanisms, necessitating a deeper understanding of their theoretical connections. Ultimately, this survey aims to provide a structured overview and a deeper insight into the strengths, limitations, and potential of GenAI in network optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Consistency Models with Generator-Augmented Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09570v4)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistency models imitate the multi-step sampling of score-based diffusion in a single forward pass of a neural network. They can be learned in two ways: consistency distillation and consistency training. The former relies on the true velocity field of the corresponding differential equation, approximated by a pre-trained neural network. In contrast, the latter uses a single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of this velocity field. The related estimation error induces a discrepancy between consistency distillation and training that, we show, still holds in the continuous-time limit. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel flow that transports noisy data towards their corresponding outputs derived from a consistency model. We prove that this flow reduces the previously identified discrepancy and the noise-data transport cost. Consequently, our method not only accelerates consistency training convergence but also enhances its overall performance.

Existing methods treat human and object motions independently, resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training, preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the quality of generated interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE(3)-Equivariant Diffusion Policy in Spherical Fourier Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01723v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policies are effective at learning closed-loop manipulation policies from human demonstrations but generalize poorly to novel arrangements of objects in 3D space, hurting real-world performance. To address this issue, we propose Spherical Diffusion Policy (SDP), an SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy that adapts trajectories according to 3D transformations of the scene. Such equivariance is achieved by embedding the states, actions, and the denoising process in spherical Fourier space. Additionally, we employ novel spherical FiLM layers to condition the action denoising process equivariantly on the scene embeddings. Lastly, we propose a spherical denoising temporal U-net that achieves spatiotemporal equivariance with computational efficiency. In the end, SDP is end-to-end SE(3) equivariant, allowing robust generalization across transformed 3D scenes. SDP demonstrates a large performance improvement over strong baselines in 20 simulation tasks and 5 physical robot tasks including single-arm and bi-manual embodiments.

Consequently, the optimal coupling is often singular with respect to Lebesgue measure. Regularizing the optimal transport problem with an entropy term yields an approximation called entropic optimal transport. Entropic penalties steer the induced coupling toward a reference measure with desired properties. For instance, when seeking a diffuse coupling, the most popular reference measures are the Lebesgue measure and the product of the two input measures. In this work, we study the case where the reference coupling is not necessarily assumed to be a product. We focus on the Gaussian case as a motivating paradigm, and provide a reduction of this more general optimal transport criterion to a matrix optimization problem. This reduction enables us to provide a complete description of the solution, both in terms of the primal variable and the dual variables. We argue that flexibility in terms of the reference measure can be important in statistical contexts, for instance when one has prior information, when there is uncertainty regarding the measures to be coupled, or to reduce bias when the entropic problem is used to estimate the un-regularized transport problem. In particular, we show in numerical examples that choosing a suitable reference plan allows to reduce the bias caused by the entropic penalty.</p></details> | 32 pages, 4 figures |

Inversion-based methods address this by reversing the denoising trajectory, mapping each image back to its approximated starting noise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the relation between the initial Gaussian noise, the generated samples, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we show that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise predicted for smooth image regions. As a consequence of this divergence, we present that the space of image inversions is notably less manipulative than the original Gaussian noise. Next, we explain the origin of the phenomenon, demonstrating that, during the first inversion steps, the noise prediction error is much more significant for the plain areas than for the rest of the image. As a surprisingly simple solution, we propose to replace the first DDIM Inversion steps with a forward diffusion process, which successfully decorrelates latent encodings, leading to higher quality editions and interpolations. The code is available at https://github.com/luk-st/taba.</p></details> | Preprint |

Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress in multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pretrained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module, Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It incorporates vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we introduce a VLM-guided pretraining strategy that leverages the strong image understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, supported by quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://weizhi-zhong.github.io/Mod-Adapter</p></details> |

Using this dataset, we compare human judgments and VLM predictions using three different evaluation methods. Our findings show that VLMs, like humans, are influenced by object counts in vague quantifier use. However, we find significant inconsistencies across models in different evaluation settings, suggesting that judging and producing vague quantifiers rely on two different processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ACL 2025, 10 pages</p></details> |

Despite progress in computer vision, existing benchmarks reveal significant gaps in models' abilities to accurately recognize object attributes and reason about spatial relationships, both essential for dynamic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose MIRAGE, a multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate models' capabilities in Counting (object attribute recognition), Relation (spatial relational reasoning), and Counting with Relation. Through diverse and complex scenarios requiring fine-grained recognition and reasoning, MIRAGE highlights critical limitations in state-of-the-art models, underscoring the need for improved representations and reasoning frameworks. By targeting these foundational abilities, MIRAGE provides a pathway toward spatiotemporal reasoning in future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Theory of Conditional Feature Alignment for Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17137v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object counting models suffer when deployed across domains with differing density variety, since density shifts are inherently task-relevant and violate standard domain adaptation assumptions. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets (e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in unsupervised domain-adaptive counting.

The results show that our method outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Assembler: Scalable 3D Part Assembly via Anchor Point Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17074v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Assembler, a scalable and generalizable framework for 3D part assembly that reconstructs complete objects from input part meshes and a reference image. Unlike prior approaches that mostly rely on deterministic part pose prediction and category-specific training, Assembler is designed to handle diverse, in-the-wild objects with varying part counts, geometries, and structures. It addresses the core challenges of scaling to general 3D part assembly through innovations in task formulation, representation, and data. First, Assembler casts part assembly as a generative problem and employs diffusion models to sample plausible configurations, effectively capturing ambiguities arising from symmetry, repeated parts, and multiple valid assemblies. Second, we introduce a novel shape-centric representation based on sparse anchor point clouds, enabling scalable generation in Euclidean space rather than SE(3) pose prediction. Third, we construct a large-scale dataset of over 320K diverse part-object assemblies using a synthesis and filtering pipeline built on existing 3D shape repositories. Assembler achieves state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and is the first to demonstrate high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects. Based on Assembler, we further introduce an interesting part-aware 3D modeling system that generates high-resolution, editable objects from images, demonstrating potential for interactive and compositional design.

| **[Open-World Object Counting in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15368v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the CountVid model, and all the code are available at https://github.com/niki-amini-naieni/CountVid/.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViCrit: A Verifiable Reinforcement Learning Proxy Task for Visual Perception in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10128v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle, synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math, showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Same Task, Different Circuits: Disentangling Modality-Specific Mechanisms in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09047v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the \textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach for reducing it.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARMOT: Masked Autoencoder for Modeling Transient Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08470v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained models have demonstrated impressive success in many modalities such as language and vision. Recent works facilitate the pretraining paradigm in imaging research. Transients are a novel modality, which are captured for an object as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved sensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of hidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using NLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or surfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned from datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling transient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a self-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient datasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features from partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the unmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts full measurements. Pretrained on TransVerse-a synthesized transient dataset of 500K 3D models-MARMOT adapts to downstream imaging tasks using direct feature transfer or decoder finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the efficiency of our MARMOT.</p></details> |  |
| **[ComPtr: Towards Diverse Bi-source Dense Prediction Tasks via A Simple yet General Complementary Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12349v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) has advanced the field of dense prediction, while gradually dissolving the inherent barriers between different tasks. However, most existing works focus on designing architectures and constructing visual cues only for the specific task, which ignores the potential uniformity introduced by the DL paradigm. In this paper, we attempt to construct a novel $\underline{ComP}$lementary $\underline{tr}$ansformer, $\textbf{ComPtr}$, for diverse bi-source dense prediction tasks. Specifically, unlike existing methods that over-specialize in a single task or a subset of tasks, ComPtr starts from the more general concept of bi-source dense prediction. Based on the basic dependence on information complementarity, we propose consistency enhancement and difference awareness components with which ComPtr can evacuate and collect important visual semantic cues from different image sources for diverse tasks, respectively. ComPtr treats different inputs equally and builds an efficient dense interaction model in the form of sequence-to-sequence on top of the transformer. This task-generic design provides a smooth foundation for constructing the unified model that can simultaneously deal with various bi-source information. In extensive experiments across several representative vision tasks, i.e. remote sensing change detection, RGB-T crowd counting, RGB-D/T salient object detection, and RGB-D semantic segmentation, the proposed method consistently obtains favorable performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/lartpang/ComPtr.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination at a Glance: Controlled Visual Edits and Fine-Grained Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07227v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on vision-language tasks but still struggle with fine-grained visual differences, leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts. We attribute this to limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute, count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines, including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Challenging Vision-Language Models with Surgical Data: A New Dataset and Broad Benchmarking Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06232v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions: (1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3) How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context? Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key areas for improvement in medical visual language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection-Driven Object Count Optimization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11721v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately controlling object count in text-to-image generation remains a key challenge. Supervised methods often fail, as training data rarely covers all count variations. Methods that manipulate the denoising process to add or remove objects can help; however, they still require labeled data, limit robustness and image quality, and rely on a slow, iterative process. Pre-trained differentiable counting models that rely on soft object density summation exist and could steer generation, but employing them presents three main challenges: (i) they are pre-trained on clean images, making them less effective during denoising steps that operate on noisy inputs; (ii) they are not robust to viewpoint changes; and (iii) optimization is computationally expensive, requiring repeated model evaluations per image. We propose a new framework that uses pre-trained object counting techniques and object detectors to guide generation. First, we optimize a counting token using an outer-loop loss computed on fully generated images. Second, we introduce a detection-driven scaling term that corrects errors caused by viewpoint and proportion shifts, among other factors, without requiring backpropagation through the detection model. Third, we show that the optimized parameters can be reused for new prompts, removing the need for repeated optimization. Our method provides efficiency through token reuse, flexibility via compatibility with various detectors, and accuracy with improved counting across diverse object categories.</p></details> | Pre-print |

To evaluate them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However, such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception, reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology, inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant. This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities.

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

While extensive research has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object counting, these tasks represent only the most fundamental level of spatial reasoning. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology. OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained subcategories. Through Internet data crawling and careful manual annotation, we construct over 1.5K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both open- and closed-source VLMs, as well as existing reasoning and spatial understanding models, exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial understanding. We further analyze failure cases and propose potential directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://qizekun.github.io/omnispatial/</p></details> |
| **[IMAGHarmony: Controllable Image Editing with Consistent Object Quantity and Layout](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01949v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent diffusion models have advanced image editing by enhancing visual quality and control, supporting broad applications across creative and personalized domains. However, current image editing largely overlooks multi-object scenarios, where precise control over object categories, counts, and spatial layouts remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce a new task, quantity-and-layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit), which aims to enable fine-grained control of object quantity and spatial structure in complex scenes. We further propose IMAGHarmony, a structure-aware framework that incorporates harmony-aware attention (HA) to integrate multimodal semantics, explicitly modeling object counts and layouts to enhance editing accuracy and structural consistency. In addition, we observe that diffusion models are susceptible to initial noise and exhibit strong preferences for specific noise patterns. Motivated by this, we present a preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that chooses semantically aligned initial noise samples based on vision-language matching, thereby improving generation stability and layout consistency in multi-object editing. To support evaluation, we construct HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGHarmony consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural alignment and semantic accuracy. The code and model are available at https://github.com/muzishen/IMAGHarmony.</p></details> |  |
| **[ComposeAnything: Composite Object Priors for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24086v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating images from text involving complex and novel object arrangements remains a significant challenge for current text-to-image (T2I) models. Although prior layout-based methods improve object arrangements using spatial constraints with 2D layouts, they often struggle to capture 3D positioning and sacrifice quality and coherence. In this work, we introduce ComposeAnything, a novel framework for improving compositional image generation without retraining existing T2I models. Our approach first leverages the chain-of-thought reasoning abilities of LLMs to produce 2.5D semantic layouts from text, consisting of 2D object bounding boxes enriched with depth information and detailed captions. Based on this layout, we generate a spatial and depth aware coarse composite of objects that captures the intended composition, serving as a strong and interpretable prior that replaces stochastic noise initialization in diffusion-based T2I models. This prior guides the denoising process through object prior reinforcement and spatial-controlled denoising, enabling seamless generation of compositional objects and coherent backgrounds, while allowing refinement of inaccurate priors. ComposeAnything outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the T2I-CompBench and NSR-1K benchmarks for prompts with 2D/3D spatial arrangements, high object counts, and surreal compositions. Human evaluations further demonstrate that our model generates high-quality images with compositions that faithfully reflect the text.</p></details> |  |

Despite their advanced visual perception, large vision-language models (LVLMs) are known to struggle with counting tasks. In this work, we evaluate the performance of several recent LVLMs on visual counting tasks across multiple counting and vision datasets. We observe that while their performance may be less prone to error for small numbers of objects, they exhibit significant weaknesses as the number of objects increases. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple yet effective baseline method that enhances LVLMs' counting ability for large numbers of objects using a divide-and-conquer approach. Our method decomposes counting problems into sub-tasks. Moreover, it incorporates a mechanism to prevent objects from being split during division, which could otherwise lead to repetitive counting -- a common issue in a naive divide-and-conquer implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various datasets and benchmarks, establishing it as a valuable reference for evaluating future solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 24 Figures, 19 Tables</p></details> |

In this work, we test how the knowledge about popular subjects hurt the accuracy of vision language models (VLMs) on standard, objective visual tasks of counting and identification. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs are strongly biased (e.g, unable to recognize a fourth stripe has been added to a 3-stripe Adidas logo) scoring an average of 17.05% accuracy in counting (e.g., counting stripes in an Adidas-like logo) across 7 diverse domains from animals, logos, chess, board games, optical illusions, to patterned grids. Insert text (e.g., "Adidas") describing the subject name into the counterfactual image further decreases VLM accuracy. The biases in VLMs are so strong that instructing them to double-check their results or rely exclusively on image details to answer improves counting accuracy by only +2 points, on average. Our work presents an interesting failure mode in VLMs and an automated framework for testing VLM biases.

This paper seeks to understand how such models behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing specifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g., an image of a dog paired with the caption "A photo of a cat") and ask the model to report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g., "What does the caption say / What is in the image?"). We find that models often favor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what the caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they favor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in the internal representational structure of the model, and that specific attention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over the other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic "router heads" which appear to promote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can be manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets and modalities. Together, the work provides essential steps towards identifying and controlling if and how models detect and resolve conflicting signals within complex multimodal environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>All c...</summary><p>All code and resources are available at: https://github.com/ethahtz/vlm_conflicting_info_processing</p></details> |

In this setup, a convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts feature representations from the input image, which then guide the decoder in a sequence-to-sequence caption generation process. Although much research has focused on refining the decoder, the quality of image representations from the encoder remains crucial for accurate captioning. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates features from two distinct CNN based encoders, capturing complementary information to enhance caption generation. Additionally, we propose a weighted averaging technique to combine the outputs of all GRUs in the stacked decoder. Furthermore, a comparison-based beam search strategy is incorporated to refine caption selection. The results demonstrate that our fusion-based approach, along with the enhanced stacked decoder, significantly outperforms both the transformer-based state-of-the-art model and other LSTM-based baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaptionSmiths: Flexibly Controlling Language Pattern in Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01409v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An image captioning model flexibly switching its language pattern, e.g., descriptiveness and length, should be useful since it can be applied to diverse applications. However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative vision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated captions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the properties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot smoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given this challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single captioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach quantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and uniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation. Given the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two endpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very short caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate that the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output captions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines. For instance, CaptionSmiths reduces the error in controlling caption length by 506\% despite better lexical alignment. Code will be available on https://github.com/omron-sinicx/captionsmiths.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |

Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation). However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways, limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor (NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning benchmarks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

However, these metrics generate explanations without standardized criteria, and the overall quality of the generated explanations remains unverified. In this paper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides structured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency, relevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of high-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation template to effectively supervise a vision-language model for both scoring and explanation generation. EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets while providing significantly higher-quality explanations than existing metrics, as validated through comprehensive human evaluation.

This work delves into the intricacies of hallucinatory phenomena exhibited by widely used image captioners, unraveling interesting patterns. Specifically, we step upon previously introduced techniques of conceptual counterfactual explanations to address VL hallucinations. The deterministic and efficient nature of the employed conceptual counterfactuals backbone is able to suggest semantically minimal edits driven by hierarchical knowledge, so that the transition from a hallucinated caption to a non-hallucinated one is performed in a black-box manner. HalCECE, our proposed hallucination detection framework is highly interpretable, by providing semantically meaningful edits apart from standalone numbers, while the hierarchical decomposition of hallucinated concepts leads to a thorough hallucination analysis. Another novelty tied to the current work is the investigation of role hallucinations, being one of the first works to involve interconnections between visual concepts in hallucination detection. Overall, HalCECE recommends an explainable direction to the crucial field of VL hallucination detection, thus fostering trustworthy evaluation of current and future VL systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoCa: Modality-aware Continual Pre-training Makes Better Bidirectional Multimodal Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23115v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs), have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with both model size and training data on MMEB.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://haon-chen.github.io/MoCa/</p></details> |

However, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in scenarios where both visual and textual modalities can be manipulated. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study of "An Image is Worth 1000 Lies: Adversarial Transferability Across Prompts on Vision-Language Models" validating the Cross-Prompt Attack (CroPA) and confirming its superior cross-prompt transferability compared to existing baselines. Beyond replication we propose several key improvements: (1) A novel initialization strategy that significantly improves Attack Success Rate (ASR). (2) Investigate cross-image transferability by learning universal perturbations. (3) A novel loss function targeting vision encoder attention mechanisms to improve generalization. Our evaluation across prominent VLMs -- including Flamingo, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP as well as extended experiments on LLaVA validates the original results and demonstrates that our improvements consistently boost adversarial effectiveness. Our work reinforces the importance of studying adversarial vulnerabilities in VLMs and provides a more robust framework for generating transferable adversarial examples, with significant implications for understanding the security of VLMs in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MLRC 2025</p></details> |

Meanwhile, referring expression segmentation (RES) enables precise object localization based on natural language descriptions but is computationally expensive when applied across large image collections. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mask-aware TIR (MaTIR), a new task that unifies TIR and RES, requiring both efficient image search and accurate object segmentation. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework, comprising a first stage for segmentation-aware image retrieval and a second stage for reranking and object grounding with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). We leverage SAM 2 to generate object masks and Alpha-CLIP to extract region-level embeddings offline at first, enabling effective and scalable online retrieval. Secondly, MLLM is used to refine retrieval rankings and generate bounding boxes, which are matched to segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on COCO and D$^3$ datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in both retrieval accuracy and segmentation quality over previous methods.</p></details> | ICMR 2025 |
| **[On the Feasibility of Poisoning Text-to-Image AI Models via Adversarial Mislabeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21874v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's text-to-image generative models are trained on millions of images sourced from the Internet, each paired with a detailed caption produced by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This part of the training pipeline is critical for supplying the models with large volumes of high-quality image-caption pairs during training. However, recent work suggests that VLMs are vulnerable to stealthy adversarial attacks, where adversarial perturbations are added to images to mislead the VLMs into producing incorrect captions. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of adversarial mislabeling attacks on VLMs as a mechanism to poisoning training pipelines for text-to-image models. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, allowing attackers to produce benign-looking images that are consistently miscaptioned by the VLM models. This has the effect of injecting strong "dirty-label" poison samples into the training pipeline for text-to-image models, successfully altering their behavior with a small number of poisoned samples. We find that while potential defenses can be effective, they can be targeted and circumvented by adaptive attackers. This suggests a cat-and-mouse game that is likely to reduce the quality of training data and increase the cost of text-to-image model development. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of these attacks, achieving high attack success (over 73%) even in black-box scenarios against commercial VLMs (Google Vertex AI and Microsoft Azure).</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM C...</summary><p>ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2025</p></details> |

While recent approaches offer some grounding capabilities, they cannot track object identities across multiple references or ground both actions and objects simultaneously. We propose a novel ID-based grounding system that enables consistent object reference tracking and action-object linking. We present GroundCap, a dataset containing 52,016 images from 77 movies, with 344 human-annotated and 52,016 automatically generated captions. Each caption is grounded on detected objects (132 classes) and actions (51 classes) using a tag system that maintains object identity while linking actions to the corresponding objects. Our approach features persistent object IDs for reference tracking, explicit action-object linking, and the segmentation of background elements through K-means clustering. We propose gMETEOR, a metric combining caption quality with grounding accuracy, and establish baseline performance by fine-tuning Pixtral-12B and Qwen2.5-VL 7B on GroundCap. Human evaluation demonstrates our approach's effectiveness in producing verifiable descriptions with coherent object references.</p></details> | 37 pages |

Two scenarios were developed, and 644 images were generated based on input prompts that specified nationalities. The results show that in one scenario, 52.88% of images, and in the other, 27.4%, depict individuals wearing traditional attire. A statistically significant relationship was observed between this representation pattern and regions. This indicates that the issue disproportionately affects certain areas, particularly the Middle East & North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. A notable association with income groups was also found. CLIP, ALIGN, and GPT-4.1 mini were used to measure alignment scores between generated images and 3320 prompts and captions, with findings indicating statistically significant higher scores for images featuring individuals in traditional attire in one scenario. The study also examined revised prompts, finding that the word "traditional" was added by the model to 88.46% of prompts for one scenario. These findings provide valuable insights into T2I models' representation of individuals across different countries, demonstrating how the examined model prioritizes traditional characteristics despite their impracticality for the given activities.</p></details> |  |

After partitioning each untrimmed long video as multiple event proposals, where each event proposal consists of a set of short video segments, we extract visual feature (e.g., C3D feature) from each segment and use the existing image/video captioning approach to generate one sentence description for this segment. Considering that the generated sentences contain rich semantic descriptions about the whole event proposal, we formulate the dense video captioning task as a visual cue aided sentence summarization problem and propose a new two stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach equipped with a new hierarchical attention mechanism to summarize all generated sentences as one descriptive sentence with the aid of visual features. Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for this event proposal. Our comprehensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed DaS framework for dense video captioning.</p></details> | 10 pages |

The key challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity, offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others; linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects. To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy, which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic coverage.

| **[Low-Complexity Semantic Packet Aggregation for Token Communication via Lookahead Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19451v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokens are fundamental processing units of generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), and token communication (TC) is essential for enabling remote AI-generate content (AIGC) and wireless LLM applications. Unlike traditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each token depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency makes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can significantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this paper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token similarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage channels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is combinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To address this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with lookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces the residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the message-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain token packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a lookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates without replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates sampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity. Experiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned images) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores comparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up to 40$\times$. Compared to other linear-complexity algorithms such as the genetic algorithm (GA), SemPA-Look achieves 10$\times$ lower complexity, demonstrating its practicality for remote AIGC and other TC applications.</p></details> |  |

Owing to massive and diverse information conveyed in real images, it is challenging for text-to-image generative models to synthesize informative training data with hand-crafted prompts. Considering the impressive ability of large generative models, could such models directly synthesize good training images for prediction tasks with proper prompts? We offer an affirmative response to this question by proposing a simple yet effective method, validated through ImageNet classification. Specifically, we caption each real image with the advanced captioning model to obtain informative and faithful prompts that extract class-relevant information and clarify the polysemy of class names. The image captions and class names are concatenated to prompt generative models for training image synthesis. We show that this simple caption incorporation significantly boosts the informativeness of synthetic data therefore enhancing downstream model generalization. More importantly, besides improvements in data augmentation and privacy preservation, our experiments demonstrate that synthesized images can exceed real data in terms of out-of-distribution robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 2 figure, 15 tables.

The dataset contains over 200,000 news articles and 400,000 associated images sourced from CNN and The Guardian, spanning diverse domains and time periods.

In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/oyt9306/RePIC</p></details> |

Throughout the years, several approaches have been adopted to explain an input image fed by the user. From detecting an object in a given image to explaining it in human understandable sentence, to having a conversation describing the image, this problem has seen an immense change throughout the years, However, the existing works have been often found to (a) hallucinate objects that do not exist in the image and/or (b) lack identifying the complete set of objects present in the image. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigate these drawbacks of inconsistency and incompleteness of the objects recognized during the image explanation. To enable this, we propose an interpretable framework that can be plugged atop diverse image explaining frameworks including Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Prompt-based AI using LLMs, thereby enhancing their explanation capabilities by rectifying the incorrect or missing objects. We further measure the efficacy of the rectified explanations generated through our proposed approaches leveraging object based precision metrics, and showcase the improvements in the inconsistency and completeness of image explanations. Quantitatively, the proposed framework is able to improve the explanations over the baseline architectures of Image Captioning (improving the completeness by 81.81% and inconsistency by 37.10%), Visual Question Answering(average of 9.6% and 37.10% in completeness and inconsistency respectively) and Prompt-based AI model (0.01% and 5.2% for completeness and inconsistency respectively) surpassing the current state-of-the-art by a substantial margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CODS-COMAD December 2024</p></details> |

| **[Characterizing control between interacting subsystems with deep Jacobian estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01946v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological function arises through the dynamical interactions of multiple subsystems, including those between brain areas, within gene regulatory networks, and more. A common approach to understanding these systems is to model the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between them. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the subsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the directionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between subsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically linear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by nonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven nonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions via the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning Jacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning method that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for arbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs outperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems, including high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we show that the "sensory" area gains greater control over the "cognitive" area over learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the trained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior. Our work lays the foundation for a theoretically grounded and data-driven understanding of interactions among biological subsystems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

We assume that the function $f$ is regular and that it is a sum of $k$-variate functions, where $k$ varies from $1$ to $s$ ($1\leq s\leq d$). These functions are unknown to us and only few of them are nonzero. In this article, we address the problem of identifying the nonzero components of $f$ in the case when $d=d_\varepsilon\to \infty$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$ and $s$ is either fixed or $s=s_\varepsilon\to \infty$, $s=o(d)$ as $\varepsilon\to \infty$. This may be viewed as a variable selection problem. We derive the conditions when exact variable selection in the model at hand is possible and provide a selection procedure that achieves this type of selection. The procedure is adaptive to a degree of model sparsity described by the sparsity parameter $\beta\in(0,1)$. We also derive conditions that make the exact variable selection impossible. Our results augment previous work in this area.</p></details> | 24 pages, 0 figures |

The averaged $J_2$ orbital parameters that describe the drift and periodic orbital motion were derived along with their target values to achieve a distributed space structure in a decentralized manner. This enabled the design of a distance-based orbital stabilizer to ensure autonomous deployment into a monolithic formation of a coplanar equidistant configuration on a user-defined orbital plane. Continuous formation control was assumed to be achieved through fuel-free actuation, such as satellite magnetic field interaction and differential aerodynamic forces, thereby maintaining long-term formation stability without thruster usage. A major challenge for such actuation systems is the potential loss of control capability due to increasing inter-satellite distances resulting from unstable orbital dynamics, particularly for autonomous satellite swarms. To mitigate this risk, our decentralized deployment controller minimized drift distance during unexpected communication outages. As a case study, we consider the deployment of palm-sized satellites into a coplanar equidistant formation in a $J_2$-perturbed orbit. Moreover, centralized grouping strategies are presented.</p></details> |  |

This work bridges the gap between theory and practice by engineering and empirically evaluating recently developed approximation algorithms for dynamically maintaining graph orientations. We comprehensively describe the underlying data structures, including efficient bucketing techniques and round-robin updates. Our implementation has a natural parameter $\lambda$, which allows for a trade-off between algorithmic efficiency and the quality of the solution. In the extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our implementation offers a considerable speedup. Using different quality metrics, we show that our implementations are very competitive and can outperform previous methods. Overall, our approach solves more instances than other methods while being up to 112 times faster on instances that are solvable by all methods compared.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ESA 2025</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we have developed a method to significantly reduce memory requirements and accelerate computations, thus facilitating the analysis of large data sets. The following cases are demonstrated: univariate and multivariate distance variance, distance covariance, partial distance correlation, energy distance, and hypothesis testing for the equality of univariate distributions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing lidar and camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in visually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data processing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer a cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging regardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers from sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this work, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph neural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in complex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the low-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such resource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources. We evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and autonomous navigation, in three different environments. Our results demonstrate strong reliability and generalizability, making RaGNNarok a robust solution for low-cost indoor mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

Current approaches extract the surface through costly post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds, with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior, our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics simulations or animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

Most existing machine learning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each microstructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained foundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic microstructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a microstructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained state-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM) in two case studies on machine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on simulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys based on experimental data published in literature.

We propose a light-weight, target-speaker-based extension to an existing streaming ASR system to enable practical transcription of overlapping speech with minimal computational overhead. Our approach combines a speaker-independent (SI) model for standard operation with a speaker-conditioned (SC) model selectively applied in overlapping scenarios. Overlap detection is achieved using a compact binary classifier trained on frozen SI model output, offering accurate segmentation at negligible cost. The SC model employs Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to incorporate speaker embeddings and is trained on synthetically mixed data to transcribe only the target speaker. Our method supports dynamic speaker tracking and reuses existing modules with minimal modifications. Evaluated on a challenging set of Czech television debates with 16% overlap, the system reduced WER on overlapping segments from 68.0% (baseline) to 35.78% while increasing total computational load by only 44%. The proposed system offers an effective and scalable solution for overlap transcription in continuous ASR services.</p></details> |  |

Thus, this paper presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting robust point correspondences between pairs of noisy, sparse and unstructured 3D point clouds from a light-weight, low-power, inexpensive, consumer-grade System-on-Chip (SoC) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensor. Our network is based on the transformer architecture which allows leveraging the attention mechanism to discover pairs of points in consecutive scans with the greatest mutual affinity. The proposed network is trained in a self-supervised way using set-based multi-label classification cross-entropy loss, where the ground-truth set of matches is found by solving the Linear Sum Assignment (LSA) optimization problem, which avoids tedious hand annotation of the training data. Additionally, posing the loss calculation as multi-label classification permits supervising on point correspondences directly instead of on odometry error, which is not feasible for sparse and noisy data from the SoC radar we use. We evaluate our method with an open-source state-of-the-art Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) framework in real-world Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights and with the widely used public Coloradar dataset. Evaluation shows that the proposed method improves the position estimation accuracy by over 14 % and 19 % on average, respectively.

| **[Global Microprocessor Correctness in the Presence of Transient Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17154v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Correctness for microprocessors is generally understood to be conformance with the associated instruction set architecture (ISA). This is the basis for one of the most important abstractions in computer science, allowing hardware designers to develop highly-optimized processors that are functionally "equivalent" to an ideal processor that executes instructions atomically. This specification is almost always informal, e.g., commercial microprocessors generally do not come with conformance specifications. In this paper, we advocate for the use of formal specifications, using the theory of refinement. We introduce notions of correctness that can be used to deal with transient execution attacks, including Meltdown and Spectre. Such attacks have shown that ubiquitous microprocessor optimizations, appearing in numerous processors for decades, are inherently buggy. Unlike alternative approaches that use non-interference properties, our notion of correctness is global, meaning it is single specification that: formalizes conformance, includes functional correctness and is parameterized by an microarchitecture. We introduce action skipping refinement, a new type of refinement and we describe how our notions of refinement can be decomposed into properties that are more amenable to automated verification using the the concept of shared-resource commitment refinement maps. We do this in the context of formal, fully executable bit- and cycle-accurate models of an ISA and a microprocessor. Finally, we show how light-weight formal methods based on property-based testing can be used to identify transient execution bugs.</p></details> |  |

However, training the candidates generated by the search algorithm for performance evaluation incurs considerable computational overhead. Our method, dubbed nasgraph, remarkably reduces the computational costs by converting neural architectures to graphs and using the average degree, a graph measure, as the proxy in lieu of the evaluation metric. Our training-free NAS method is data-agnostic and light-weight. It can find the best architecture among 200 randomly sampled architectures from NAS-Bench201 in 217 CPU seconds. Besides, our method is able to achieve competitive performance on various datasets including NASBench-101, NASBench-201, and NDS search spaces. We also demonstrate that nasgraph generalizes to more challenging tasks on Micro TransNAS-Bench-101.</p></details> |  |

Such models are light-weight and computationally efficient, allowing them to be trained on consumer laptops. SHRED-based models rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the temporal encoding and spatial decoding respectively. Despite the relatively simple structure of SHRED, they are able to predict chaotic dynamical systems on different physical, spatial, and temporal scales directly from a sparse set of sensor measurements. In this work, we improve SHRED by leveraging transformers (T-SHRED) for the temporal encoding which improves performance on next-step state prediction on large datasets. We also introduce a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) attention mechanism into T-SHRED to perform symbolic regression directly on the latent space as part of the model regularization architecture. Symbolic regression improves model interpretability by learning and regularizing the dynamics of the latent space during training. We analyze the performance of T-SHRED on three different dynamical systems ranging from low-data to high-data regimes. We observe that SINDy attention T-SHRED accurately predicts future frames based on an interpretable symbolic model across all tested datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Transactions of the Royal Society (Symbolic Regression in the Physical Sciences)</p></details> |
| **[Semantic and Feature Guided Uncertainty Quantification of Visual Localization for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15851v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The uncertainty quantification of sensor measurements coupled with deep learning networks is crucial for many robotics systems, especially for safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars. This paper develops an uncertainty quantification approach in the context of visual localization for autonomous driving, where locations are selected based on images. Key to our approach is to learn the measurement uncertainty using light-weight sensor error model, which maps both image feature and semantic information to 2-dimensional error distribution. Our approach enables uncertainty estimation conditioned on the specific context of the matched image pair, implicitly capturing other critical, unannotated factors (e.g., city vs highway, dynamic vs static scenes, winter vs summer) in a latent manner. We demonstrate the accuracy of our uncertainty prediction framework using the Ithaca365 dataset, which includes variations in lighting and weather (sunny, night, snowy). Both the uncertainty quantification of the sensor+network is evaluated, along with Bayesian localization filters using unique sensor gating method. Results show that the measurement error does not follow a Gaussian distribution with poor weather and lighting conditions, and is better predicted by our Gaussian Mixture model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Delayed Expansion AGT: Kinodynamic Planning with Application to Tractor-Trailer Parking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13421v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kinodynamic planning of articulated vehicles in cluttered environments faces additional challenges arising from high-dimensional state space and complex system dynamics. Built upon [1],[2], this work proposes the DE-AGT algorithm that grows a tree using pre-computed motion primitives (MPs) and A* heuristics. The first feature of DE-AGT is a delayed expansion of MPs. In particular, the MPs are divided into different modes, which are ranked online. With the MP classification and prioritization, DE-AGT expands the most promising mode of MPs first, which eliminates unnecessary computation and finds solutions faster. To obtain the cost-to-go heuristic for nonholonomic articulated vehicles, we rely on supervised learning and train neural networks for fast and accurate cost-to-go prediction. The learned heuristic is used for online mode ranking and node selection. Another feature of DE-AGT is the improved goal-reaching. Exactly reaching a goal state usually requires a constant connection checking with the goal by solving steering problems -- non-trivial and time-consuming for articulated vehicles. The proposed termination scheme overcomes this challenge by tightly integrating a light-weight trajectory tracking controller with the search process. DE-AGT is implemented for autonomous parking of a general car-like tractor with 3-trailer. Simulation results show an average of 10x acceleration compared to a previous method.</p></details> |  |

However, fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set. Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module, which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities. Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to individual users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

| **[Teacher-student training improves accuracy and efficiency of machine learning interatomic potentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05379v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing the field of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Recent MLIPs have tended towards more complex architectures trained on larger datasets. The resulting increase in computational and memory costs may prohibit the application of these MLIPs to perform large-scale MD simulations. Here, we present a teacher-student training framework in which the latent knowledge from the teacher (atomic energies) is used to augment the students' training. We show that the light-weight student MLIPs have faster MD speeds at a fraction of the memory footprint compared to the teacher models. Remarkably, the student models can even surpass the accuracy of the teachers, even though both are trained on the same quantum chemistry dataset. Our work highlights a practical method for MLIPs to reduce the resources required for large-scale MD simulations.</p></details> |  |

The paper establishes, for small sources, the existence of solutions on the continuous and discrete level of lowest-order piecewise divergence-free Crouzeix--Raviart finite elements. The vorticity employs a vector version of the pressure space with normal and tangential velocity jump penalisation terms. A simple Raviart--Thomas interpolant leads to pressure-robust a priori error estimates. An explicit residual-based a posteriori error estimate allows for efficient and reliable a posteriori error control. The efficiency for the Forchheimer nonlinearity requires a novel discrete inequality of independent interest. The implementation is based upon a light-weight forest-of-trees data structure handled by a highly parallel set of adaptive {mesh refining} algorithms. Numerical simulations reveal robustness of the a posteriori error estimates and improved convergence rates by adaptive mesh-refining.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPU Acceleration of SQL Analytics on Compressed Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10092v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPUs are uniquely suited to accelerate (SQL) analytics workloads thanks to their massive compute parallelism and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) -- when datasets fit in the GPU HBM, performance is unparalleled. Unfortunately, GPU HBMs remain typically small when compared with lower-bandwidth CPU main memory. Besides brute-force scaling across many GPUs, current solutions to accelerate queries on large datasets include leveraging data partitioning and loading smaller data batches in GPU HBM, and hybrid execution with a connected device (e.g., CPUs). Unfortunately, these approaches are exposed to the limitations of lower main memory and host-to-device interconnect bandwidths, introduce additional I/O overheads, or incur higher costs. This is a substantial problem when trying to scale adoption of GPUs on larger datasets. Data compression can alleviate this bottleneck, but to avoid paying for costly decompression/decoding, an ideal solution must include computation primitives to operate directly on data in compressed form. This is the focus of our paper: a set of new methods for running queries directly on light-weight compressed data using schemes such as Run-Length Encoding (RLE), index encoding, bit-width reductions, and dictionary encoding. Our novelty includes operating on multiple RLE columns without decompression, handling heterogeneous column encodings, and leveraging PyTorch tensor operations for portability across devices. Experimental evaluations show speedups of an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art commercial CPU-only analytics systems, for real-world queries on a production dataset that would not fit into GPU memory uncompressed. This work paves the road for GPU adoption in a much broader set of use cases, and it is complementary to most other scale-out or fallback mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpikeSMOKE: Spiking Neural Networks for Monocular 3D Object Detection with Cross-Scale Gated Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07737v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low energy consumption for 3D object detection is an important research area because of the increasing energy consumption with their wide application in fields such as autonomous driving. The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with low-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this research. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose the SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power monocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will generate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared with the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue, inspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose a cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature representation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated filtering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the speed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can maintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection performance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection, the proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2, Moderate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by AP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively. It is important to note that the results of SpikeSMOKE can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to the results on SMOKE. For example,the energy consumption can be reduced by 72.2% on the hard category, while the detection performance is reduced by only 4%. SpikeSMOKE-L (lightweight) can further reduce the amount of parameters by 3 times and computation by 10 times compared to SMOKE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis of Anonymous User Interaction Relationships and Prediction of Advertising Feedback Based on Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13787v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While online advertising is highly dependent on implicit interaction networks of anonymous users for engagement inference, and for the selection and optimization of delivery strategies, existing graph models seldom can capture the multi-scale temporal, semantic and higher-order dependency features of these interaction networks, thus it's hard to describe the complicated patterns of the anonymous behavior. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Temporal-Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (DTH-GNN), which achieves three main contributions. Above all, we introduce temporal edge decomposition, which divides each interaction into three types of channels: short-term burst, diurnal cycle and long-range memory, and conducts feature extraction using the convolution kernel of parallel dilated residuals; Furthermore, our model builds a hierarchical heterogeneous aggregation, where user-user, user-advertisement, advertisement-advertisement subgraphs are combined through the meta-path conditional Transformer encoder, where the noise structure is dynamically tamped down via the synergy of cross-channel self-attention and gating relationship selector. Thirdly, the contrast regularity of feedback perception is formulated, the consistency of various time slices is maximized, the entropy of control exposure information with dual-view target is maximized, the global prototype of dual-momentum queue distillation is presented, and the strategy gradient layer with light weight is combined with delaying transformation signal to fine-tune the node representation for benefit-oriented. The AUC of DTH-GNN improved by 8.2% and the logarithmic loss improved by 5.7% in comparison with the best baseline model.</p></details> |  |

Despite existing pre-trained model (PTM) based methods performing excellently in CIL, it is better to fine-tune them on downstream incremental tasks with massive patterns unknown to PTMs. However, using task streams for fine-tuning could lead to \textit{catastrophic forgetting} that will erase the knowledge in PTMs. This paper proposes the Dual Prototype network for Task-wise Adaption (DPTA) of PTM-based CIL. For each incremental learning task, an adapter module is built to fine-tune the PTM, where the center-adapt loss forces the representation to be more centrally clustered and class separable. The dual prototype network improves the prediction process by enabling test-time adapter selection, where the raw prototypes deduce several possible task indexes of test samples to select suitable adapter modules for PTM, and the augmented prototypes that could separate highly correlated classes are utilized to determine the final result. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the excellent performance of DPTA.

Existing methods, primarily based on regularization techniques like knowledge distillation, help preserve old knowledge but often face challenges in effectively integrating new knowledge, resulting in limited overall improvement. Endpoints Weight Fusion (EWF) method, while simple, effectively addresses some of these limitations by dynamically fusing the model weights from previous steps with those from the current step, using a fusion parameter alpha determined by the relative number of previously known classes and newly introduced classes. However, the simplicity of the alpha calculation may limit its ability to fully capture the complexities of different task scenarios, potentially leading to suboptimal fusion outcomes. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach called Adaptive Weight Fusion (AWF), which introduces an alternating training strategy for the fusion parameter, allowing for more flexible and adaptive weight integration. AWF achieves superior performance by better balancing the retention of old knowledge with the learning of new classes, significantly improving results on benchmark CISS tasks compared to the original EWF. And our experiment code will be released on Github.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Prototype Calibration of Vision-Language Models for Generalized Few-shot Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22979v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) aims to extend a segmentation model to novel classes with only a few annotated examples while maintaining performance on base classes. Recently, pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve generalization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning. However, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic, limiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples, particularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we propose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over multi-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive prototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype calibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable visual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive representation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning techniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these calibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and uncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to limited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental results on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed FewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS and class-incremental setting.

Existing methods face a critical dilemma: static architectures rely on a fixed parameter space to learn from data that arrive sequentially, prone to overfitting to the current session, while dynamic architectures require the expansion of the parameter space continually, leading to increased complexity. In this study, we explore the potential of Selective State Space Models (SSMs) for FSCIL. Mamba leverages its input-dependent parameters to dynamically adjust its processing patterns and generate content-aware scan patterns within a fixed architecture. This enables it to configure distinct processing for base and novel classes, effectively preserving existing knowledge while adapting to new ones. To leverage Mamba's potential for FSCIL, we design two key modules: First, we propose a dual selective SSM projector that dynamically adjusts the projection parameters based on the intermediate features for dynamic adaptation. The dual-design structurally decouples base and novel class processing with a frozen base branch, employing a frozen base branch to maintain robust base-class features and a dynamic incremental branch that adaptively learns distinctive feature shifts for novel classes. Second, we develop a class-sensitive selective scan mechanism to guide dynamic adaptation of the incremental branch. It minimizes the disruption to base-class representations caused by training on novel data, and meanwhile, forces the selective scan to perform in distinct patterns between base and novel classes. Extensive experiments on miniImageNet, CUB-200, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that Mamba-FSCIL achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[ConCM: Consistency-Driven Calibration and Matching for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19558v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM) that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL. Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures(Excluding the appendix)</p></details> |
| **[MOS: Model Surgery for Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09441v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continually acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting old ones. Despite Pre-trained Models (PTMs) have shown excellent performance in CIL, catastrophic forgetting still occurs as the model learns new concepts. Existing work seeks to utilize lightweight components to adjust the PTM, while the forgetting phenomenon still comes from {\em parameter and retrieval} levels. Specifically, iterative updates of the model result in parameter drift, while mistakenly retrieving irrelevant modules leads to the mismatch during inference. To this end, we propose MOdel Surgery (MOS) to rescue the model from forgetting previous knowledge. By training task-specific adapters, we continually adjust the PTM to downstream tasks. To mitigate parameter-level forgetting, we present an adapter merging approach to learn task-specific adapters, which aims to bridge the gap between different components while reserve task-specific information. Besides, to address retrieval-level forgetting, we introduce a training-free self-refined adapter retrieval mechanism during inference, which leverages the model's inherent ability for better adapter retrieval. By jointly rectifying the model with those steps, MOS can robustly resist catastrophic forgetting in the learning process. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate MOS's state-of-the-art performance.

Recently, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, like prompt pool-based approaches and adapter tuning, have shown great attraction in CIL. However, these methods either introduce additional parameters that increase memory usage, or rely on rigid regularization techniques which reduce forgetting but compromise model flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Elastic Knowledge Preservation and Compensation (EKPC) method, integrating Importance-aware Parameter Regularization (IPR) and Trainable Semantic Drift Compensation (TSDC) for CIL. Specifically, the IPR method assesses the sensitivity of network parameters to prior tasks using a novel parameter-importance algorithm. It then selectively constrains updates within the shared adapter according to these importance values, thereby preserving previously acquired knowledge while maintaining the model's flexibility. However, it still exhibits slight semantic differences in previous knowledge to accommodate new incremental tasks, leading to decision boundaries confusion in classifier. To eliminate this confusion, TSDC trains a unified classifier by compensating prototypes with trainable semantic drift. Extensive experiments on five CIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing superior performances to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Honey types of different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits, thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers' interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation. Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB) algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability into neural networks.

Most hyperbolic feature augmentation is confined to closed-environment, assuming the number of classes is fixed (\emph{i.e.}, seen classes) and generating features only for these classes. In this paper, we propose a hyperbolic dual feature augmentation method for open-environment, which augments features for both seen and unseen classes in the hyperbolic space. To obtain a more precise approximation of the real data distribution for efficient training, (1) we adopt a neural ordinary differential equation module, enhanced by meta-learning, estimating the feature distributions of both seen and unseen classes; (2) we then introduce a regularizer to preserve the latent hierarchical structures of data in the hyperbolic space; (3) we also derive an upper bound for the hyperbolic dual augmentation loss, allowing us to train a hyperbolic model using infinite augmentations for seen and unseen classes. Extensive experiments on five open-environment tasks: class-incremental learning, few-shot open-set recognition, few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, and general image classification, demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the performance of hyperbolic algorithms in open-environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2207.03824, arXiv:2304.11855 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Neural Collapse Detection Transformer for Class Incremental Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08562v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, object detection models have witnessed notable performance improvements, particularly with transformer-based models. However, new objects frequently appear in the real world, requiring detection models to continually learn without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. Although Incremental Object Detection (IOD) has emerged to address this challenge, these existing models are still not practical due to their limited performance and prolonged inference time. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for IOD, called Hier-DETR: Hierarchical Neural Collapse Detection Transformer, ensuring both efficiency and competitive performance by leveraging Neural Collapse for imbalance dataset and Hierarchical relation of classes' labels.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPFormer: Dynamic Prompt Transformer for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07414v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In continual learning, solving the catastrophic forgetting problem may make the models fall into the stability-plasticity dilemma. Moreover, inter-task confusion will also occur due to the lack of knowledge exchanges between different tasks. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel dynamic prompt transformer (DPFormer) with prompt schemes. The prompt schemes help the DPFormer memorize learned knowledge of previous classes and tasks, and keep on learning new knowledge from new classes and tasks under a single network structure with a nearly fixed number of model parameters. Moreover, they also provide discrepant information to represent different tasks to solve the inter-task confusion problem. Based on prompt schemes, a unified classification module with the binary cross entropy loss, the knowledge distillation loss and the auxiliary loss is proposed to train the whole model in an end-to-end trainable manner. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves the best performance in the CIFAR-100, ImageNet100 and ImageNet1K datasets under different class-incremental settings in continual learning. The source code will be available at our GitHub after acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample Compression for Self Certified Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10503v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning algorithms aim to learn from a sequence of tasks, making the training distribution non-stationary. The majority of existing continual learning approaches in the literature rely on heuristics and do not provide learning guarantees. In this paper, we present a new method called Continual Pick-to-Learn (CoP2L), which is able to retain the most representative samples for each task in an efficient way. CoP2L combines the Pick-to-Learn algorithm (rooted in the sample compression theory) and the experience replay continual learning scheme. This allows us to provide non-vacuous upper bounds on the generalization loss of the learned predictors, numerically computable after each task. We empirically evaluate our approach on several standard continual learning benchmarks across Class-Incremental, Task-Incremental, and Domain-Incremental settings. Our results show that CoP2L is highly competitive across all setups, often outperforming existing baselines, and significantly mitigating catastrophic forgetting compared to vanilla experience replay in the Class-Incremental setting. It is possible to leverage the bounds provided by CoP2L in practical scenarios to certify the predictor reliability on previously learned tasks, in order to improve the trustworthiness of the continual learning algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tripartite Weight-Space Ensemble for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15720v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) enables the continual learning of new concepts with only a few training examples. In FSCIL, the model undergoes substantial updates, making it prone to forgetting previous concepts and overfitting to the limited new examples. Most recent trend is typically to disentangle the learning of the representation from the classification head of the model. A well-generalized feature extractor on the base classes (many examples and many classes) is learned, and then fixed during incremental learning. Arguing that the fixed feature extractor restricts the model's adaptability to new classes, we introduce a novel FSCIL method to effectively address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. Our method enables to seamlessly update the entire model with a few examples. We mainly propose a tripartite weight-space ensemble (Tri-WE). Tri-WE interpolates the base, immediately previous, and current models in weight-space, especially for the classification heads of the models. Then, it collaboratively maintains knowledge from the base and previous models. In addition, we recognize the challenges of distilling generalized representations from the previous model from scarce data. Hence, we suggest a regularization loss term using amplified data knowledge distillation. Simply intermixing the few-shot data, we can produce richer data enabling the distillation of critical knowledge from the previous model. Consequently, we attain state-of-the-art results on the miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100 datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Exemplar-condensed Federated Class-incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18926v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Exemplar-Condensed federated class-incremental learning (ECoral) to distil the training characteristics of real images from streaming data into informative rehearsal exemplars. The proposed method eliminates the limitations of exemplar selection in replay-based approaches for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in federated continual learning (FCL). The limitations particularly related to the heterogeneity of information density of each summarized data. Our approach maintains the consistency of training gradients and the relationship to past tasks for the summarized exemplars to represent the streaming data compared to the original images effectively. Additionally, our approach reduces the information-level heterogeneity of the summarized data by inter-client sharing of the disentanglement generative model. Extensive experiments show that our ECoral outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and can be seamlessly integrated with many existing approaches to enhance performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class Incremental Learning for Algorithm Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01545v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithm selection is commonly used to predict the best solver from a portfolio per per-instance. In many real scenarios, instances arrive in a stream: new instances become available over time, while the number of class labels can also grow as new data distributions arrive downstream. As a result, the classification model needs to be periodically updated to reflect additional solvers without catastrophic forgetting of past data. In machine-learning (ML), this is referred to as Class Incremental Learning (CIL). While commonly addressed in ML settings, its relevance to algorithm-selection in optimisation has not been previously studied. Using a bin-packing dataset, we benchmark 8 continual learning methods with respect to their ability to withstand catastrophic forgetting. We find that rehearsal-based methods significantly outperform other CIL methods. While there is evidence of forgetting, the loss is small at around 7%. Hence, these methods appear to be a viable approach to continual learning in streaming optimisation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at GECCO 2025. 4 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[STSA: Federated Class-Incremental Learning via Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01327v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) enables Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) from distributed data. Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[L3A: Label-Augmented Analytic Adaptation for Multi-Label Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00816v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes continually without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Multi-label CIL (MLCIL) extends CIL to a real-world scenario where each sample may belong to multiple classes, introducing several challenges: label absence, which leads to incomplete historical information due to missing labels, and class imbalance, which results in the model bias toward majority classes. To address these challenges, we propose Label-Augmented Analytic Adaptation (L3A), an exemplar-free approach without storing past samples. L3A integrates two key modules. The pseudo-label (PL) module implements label augmentation by generating pseudo-labels for current phase samples, addressing the label absence problem. The weighted analytic classifier (WAC) derives a closed-form solution for neural networks. It introduces sample-specific weights to adaptively balance the class contribution and mitigate class imbalance. Experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that L3A outperforms existing methods in MLCIL tasks.
