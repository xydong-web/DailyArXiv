From an algorithmic perspective, there is a sharp difference in complexity between detecting and counting the copies of a given length-$k$ pattern in a length-$n$ permutation. The former admits a $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^2)} \cdot n$ time algorithm (Guillemot and Marx, 2014) while the latter cannot be solved in time $f(k)\cdot n^{o(k/\log k)}$ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails (Berendsohn, Kozma, and Marx, 2021). In fact already for patterns of length 4, exact counting is unlikely to admit near-linear time algorithms under standard fine-grained complexity assumptions (Dudek and Gawrychowski, 2020). Recently, Ben-Eliezer, Mitrović and Sristava (2026) showed that for patterns of length up to 5, a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of the pattern count can be computed in near-linear time, yielding a separation between exact and approximate counting for small patterns, and conjectured that approximate counting is asymptotically easier than exact counting in general. We strongly refute their conjecture by showing that, under ETH, no algorithm running in time $f(k)\cdot n^{o(k/\log k)}$ can approximate the number of copies of a length-$k$ pattern within a multiplicative factor $n^{(1/2-\varepsilon)k}$. The lower bound on runtime matches the conditional lower bound for exact pattern counting, and the obtained bound on the multiplicative error factor is essentially tight, as an $n^{k/2}$-approximation can be computed in $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^2)}\cdot n$ time using an algorithm for pattern detection.</p></details> |  |

However, even state-of-the-art methods often degrade under unseen conditions, highlighting the need for robust and generalizable robot sensing. The RoboSense 2025 Challenge is designed to advance robustness and adaptability in robot perception across diverse sensing scenarios. It unifies five complementary research tracks spanning language-grounded decision making, socially compliant navigation, sensor configuration generalization, cross-view and cross-modal correspondence, and cross-platform 3D perception. Together, these tasks form a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating real-world sensing reliability under domain shifts, sensor failures, and platform discrepancies. RoboSense 2025 provides standardized datasets, baseline models, and unified evaluation protocols, enabling large-scale and reproducible comparison of robust perception methods. The challenge attracted 143 teams from 85 institutions across 16 countries, reflecting broad community engagement. By consolidating insights from 23 winning solutions, this report highlights emerging methodological trends, shared design principles, and open challenges across all tracks, marking a step toward building robots that can sense reliably, act robustly, and adapt across platforms in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Offic...</summary><p>Official IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Report; 51 pages, 37 figures, 5 tables; Competition Website at https://robosense2025.github.io/</p></details> |

| **[Belief Is All You Need: Modeling Narrative Archetypes in Conspiratorial Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10105v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded within digital communication ecosystems, yet its structure and spread remain difficult to study. This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features. Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.</p></details> |  |

| **[Neural Algorithmic Reasoning for Approximate $k$-Coloring with Recursive Warm Starts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05137v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node coloring is the task of assigning colors to the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color, while using as few colors as possible. It is the most widely studied instance of graph coloring and of central importance in graph theory; major results include the Four Color Theorem and work on the Hadwiger-Nelson Problem. As an abstraction of classical combinatorial optimization tasks, such as scheduling and resource allocation, it is also rich in practical applications. Here, we focus on a relaxed version, approximate $k$-coloring, which is the task of assigning at most $k$ colors to the nodes of a graph such that the number of edges whose vertices have the same color is approximately minimized. While classical approaches leverage mathematical programming or SAT solvers, recent studies have explored the use of machine learning. We follow this route and explore the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for node coloring. We first present an optimized differentiable algorithm that improves a prior approach by Schuetz et al. with orthogonal node feature initialization and a loss function that penalizes conflicting edges more heavily when their endpoints have higher degree; the latter inspired by the classical result that a graph is $k$-colorable if and only if its $k$-core is $k$-colorable. Next, we introduce a lightweight greedy local search algorithm and show that it may be improved by recursively computing a $(k-1)$-coloring to use as a warm start. We then show that applying such recursive warm starts to the GNN approach leads to further improvements. Numerical experiments on a range of different graph structures show that while the local search algorithms perform best on small inputs, the GNN exhibits superior performance at scale. The recursive warm start may be of independent interest beyond graph coloring for local search methods for combinatorial optimization.</p></details> | 33 pages, 10 figures |

Given a monocular video of a dynamic object, our model reconstructs the object's complete 3D shape and motion, represented as a deformation field. Our key contribution is a compact latent space that encodes the entire animation sequence in a single pass. This latent space is learned by an autoencoder that, during training, is guided by the skeletal structure of the training objects, providing strong priors on plausible deformations. Crucially, skeletal information is not required at inference time. The encoder employs spatio-temporal attention, yielding a more stable representation of the object's overall deformation. Building on this representation, we train a latent diffusion model that, conditioned on the input video and the mesh reconstructed from the first frame, predicts the full animation in one shot. We evaluate Mesh4D on reconstruction and novel view synthesis benchmarks, outperforming prior methods in recovering accurate 3D shape and deformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, project page: https://mesh-4d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Pixel-Perfect Visual Geometry Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05246v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering clean and accurate geometry from images is essential for robotics and augmented reality. However, existing geometry foundation models still suffer severely from flying pixels and the loss of fine details. In this paper, we present pixel-perfect visual geometry models that can predict high-quality, flying-pixel-free point clouds by leveraging generative modeling in the pixel space. We first introduce Pixel-Perfect Depth (PPD), a monocular depth foundation model built upon pixel-space diffusion transformers (DiT). To address the high computational complexity associated with pixel-space diffusion, we propose two key designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted DiT, which incorporates semantic representations from vision foundation models to prompt the diffusion process, preserving global semantics while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT architecture that progressively increases the number of image tokens, improving both efficiency and accuracy. To further extend PPD to video (PPVD), we introduce a new Semantics-Consistent DiT, which extracts temporally consistent semantics from a multi-view geometry foundation model. We then perform reference-guided token propagation within the DiT to maintain temporal coherence with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our models achieve the best performance among all generative monocular and video depth estimation models and produce significantly cleaner point clouds than all other models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/gangweix/pixel-perfect-depth</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Clinical Text and Class Conditioning for 3D Prostate MRI Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10230v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, nonmedical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM pipeline centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.070. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74% and outperforms classifiers trained on images generated by prior state-of-the-art. Classifier training solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to real image training. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric pipeline enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 2025.

However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup. To this end, we also build a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets. Using our augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Deep Learning: A Probabilistic Framework for Modeling Uncertainty in Structured Temporal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05227v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I propose a novel framework that integrates stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with deep generative models to improve uncertainty quantification in machine learning applications involving structured and temporal data. This approach, termed Stochastic Latent Differential Inference (SLDI), embeds an Itô SDE in the latent space of a variational autoencoder, allowing for flexible, continuous-time modeling of uncertainty while preserving a principled mathematical foundation. The drift and diffusion terms of the SDE are parameterized by neural networks, enabling data-driven inference and generalizing classical time series models to handle irregular sampling and complex dynamic structure. A central theoretical contribution is the co-parameterization of the adjoint state with a dedicated neural network, forming a coupled forward-backward system that captures not only latent evolution but also gradient dynamics. I introduce a pathwise-regularized adjoint loss and analyze variance-reduced gradient flows through the lens of stochastic calculus, offering new tools for improving training stability in deep latent SDEs. My paper unifies and extends variational inference, continuous-time generative modeling, and control-theoretic optimization, providing a rigorous foundation for future developments in stochastic probabilistic machine learning.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6330 words |

One key application is Brain Age Prediction (BAP), which estimates an individual's biological brain age from MRI data. Effective BAP models require large, diverse, and age-balanced datasets, whereas existing 3D MRI datasets are demographically skewed, limiting fairness and generalizability. Acquiring new data is costly and ethically constrained, motivating generative data augmentation. Current generative methods are often based on latent diffusion models, which operate in learned low dimensional latent spaces to address the memory demands of volumetric MRI data. However, these methods are typically slow at inference, may introduce artifacts due to latent compression, and are rarely conditioned on age, thereby affecting the BAP performance. In this work, we propose FlowLet, a conditional generative framework that synthesizes age-conditioned 3D MRIs by leveraging flow matching within an invertible 3D wavelet domain, helping to avoid reconstruction artifacts and reducing computational demands. Experiments show that FlowLet generates high-fidelity volumes with few sampling steps. Training BAP models with data generated by FlowLet improves performance for underrepresented age groups, and region-based analysis confirms preservation of anatomical structures.</p></details> |  |

From an algorithmic perspective, there is a sharp difference in complexity between detecting and counting the copies of a given length-$k$ pattern in a length-$n$ permutation. The former admits a $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^2)} \cdot n$ time algorithm (Guillemot and Marx, 2014) while the latter cannot be solved in time $f(k)\cdot n^{o(k/\log k)}$ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails (Berendsohn, Kozma, and Marx, 2021).

We strongly refute their conjecture by showing that, under ETH, no algorithm running in time $f(k)\cdot n^{o(k/\log k)}$ can approximate the number of copies of a length-$k$ pattern within a multiplicative factor $n^{(1/2-\varepsilon)k}$. The lower bound on runtime matches the conditional lower bound for exact pattern counting, and the obtained bound on the multiplicative error factor is essentially tight, as an $n^{k/2}$-approximation can be computed in $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^2)}\cdot n$ time using an algorithm for pattern detection.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce VerseCrafter, a 4D-aware video world model that enables explicit and coherent control over both camera and object dynamics within a unified 4D geometric world state. Our approach is centered on a novel 4D Geometric Control representation, which encodes the world state through a static background point cloud and per-object 3D Gaussian trajectories. This representation captures not only an object's path but also its probabilistic 3D occupancy over time, offering a flexible, category-agnostic alternative to rigid bounding boxes or parametric models. These 4D controls are rendered into conditioning signals for a pretrained video diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-fidelity, view-consistent videos that precisely adhere to the specified dynamics. Unfortunately, another major challenge lies in the scarcity of large-scale training data with explicit 4D annotations. We address this by developing an automatic data engine that extracts the required 4D controls from in-the-wild videos, allowing us to train our model on a massive and diverse dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sixiaozheng.github.io/VerseCrafter_page/</p></details> |

We study this failure mode in a controlled object-counting setting, where the prompt overstates the number of objects in the image (e.g., asking a model to describe four waterlilies when only three are present). At low object counts, models often correct the overestimation, but as the number of objects increases, they increasingly conform to the prompt regardless of the discrepancy. Through mechanistic analysis of three VLMs, we identify a small set of attention heads whose ablation substantially reduces prompt-induced hallucinations (PIH) by at least 40% without additional training. Across models, PIH-heads mediate prompt copying in model-specific ways. We characterize these differences and show that PIH ablation increases correction toward visual evidence. Our findings offer insights into the internal mechanisms driving prompt-induced hallucinations, revealing model-specific differences in how these behaviors are implemented.</p></details> |  |

The RoboSense 2025 Challenge is designed to advance robustness and adaptability in robot perception across diverse sensing scenarios. It unifies five complementary research tracks spanning language-grounded decision making, socially compliant navigation, sensor configuration generalization, cross-view and cross-modal correspondence, and cross-platform 3D perception. Together, these tasks form a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating real-world sensing reliability under domain shifts, sensor failures, and platform discrepancies. RoboSense 2025 provides standardized datasets, baseline models, and unified evaluation protocols, enabling large-scale and reproducible comparison of robust perception methods. The challenge attracted 143 teams from 85 institutions across 16 countries, reflecting broad community engagement.

Existing datasets and methods commonly support single-target expressions only, i.e., one expression refers to one object, not considering multi-target and no-target expressions. This greatly limits the real applications of REx (RES/REC/REG). This paper introduces three new benchmarks called Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES), Comprehension (GREC), and Generation (GREG), collectively denoted as GREx, which extend the classic REx to allow expressions to identify an arbitrary number of objects. We construct the first large-scale GREx dataset gRefCOCO that contains multi-target, no-target, and single-target expressions and their corresponding images with labeled targets. GREx and gRefCOCO are designed to be backward-compatible with REx, facilitating extensive experiments to study the performance gap of the existing REx methods on GREx tasks. One of the challenges of GRES/GREC is complex relationship modeling, for which we propose a baseline ReLA that adaptively divides the image into regions with sub-instance clues and explicitly models the region-region and region-language dependencies. The proposed ReLA achieves the state-of-the-art results on the both GRES and GREC tasks. The proposed gRefCOCO dataset and method are available at https://henghuiding.github.io/GREx.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCV,...</summary><p>IJCV, Project Page: https://henghuiding.com/GREx/</p></details> |

Le~Cam showed that, when $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ have a common dominating measure, a test that has power exceeding its level by more than $\varepsilon$ exists if and only if the convex hulls of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are separated in total variation distance by more than $\varepsilon$. The requirement of a dominating measure is frequently violated in nonparametric statistics. In a passing remark, Le~Cam described an approach to address more general scenarios, but he stopped short of stating a formal theorem. This work completes Le~Cam's program, by presenting a matching necessary and sufficient condition for testability: for the aforementioned theorem to hold without assumptions, one must take the closures of the convex hulls of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ in the space of bounded finitely additive measures. We provide simple elucidating examples, and elaborate on various subtle measure theoretic and topological points regarding compactness and achievability.</p></details> | 28 pages |

Recently, Ben-Eliezer, Mitrović and Sristava (2026) showed that for patterns of length up to 5, a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of the pattern count can be computed in near-linear time, yielding a separation between exact and approximate counting for small patterns, and conjectured that approximate counting is asymptotically easier than exact counting in general. We strongly refute their conjecture by showing that, under ETH, no algorithm running in time $f(k)\cdot n^{o(k/\log k)}$ can approximate the number of copies of a length-$k$ pattern within a multiplicative factor $n^{(1/2-\varepsilon)k}$. The lower bound on runtime matches the conditional lower bound for exact pattern counting, and the obtained bound on the multiplicative error factor is essentially tight, as an $n^{k/2}$-approximation can be computed in $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^2)}\cdot n$ time using an algorithm for pattern detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arabic Prompts with English Tools: A Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05101v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral to numerous industries, increasingly serving as the core reasoning engine for autonomous agents that perform complex tasks through tool-use. While the development of Arabic-native LLMs is accelerating, the benchmarks for evaluating their capabilities lag behind, with most existing frameworks focusing on English. A critical and overlooked area is tool-calling, where the performance of models prompted in non-English languages like Arabic is poorly understood, especially since these models are often pretrained on predominantly English data. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating the tool-calling and agentic capabilities of LLMs in the Arabic language. Our work provides a standardized framework to measure the functional accuracy and robustness of models in Arabic agentic workflows. Our findings reveal a huge performance gap: when users interact in Arabic, tool-calling accuracy drops by an average of 5-10\%, regardless of whether the tool descriptions themselves are in Arabic or English. By shedding light on these critical challenges, this benchmark aims to foster the development of more reliable and linguistically equitable AI agents for Arabic-speaking users.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, LLMs, Big Data, and Multilinguality for All (LLMs4All) Workshop at IEEE BigData 2025 Conference, Macau, December 10, 2025</p></details> |
| **[The RoboSense Challenge: Sense Anything, Navigate Anywhere, Adapt Across Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05014v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in open and dynamic environments -- from city streets to aerial and indoor spaces -- where perception models must remain reliable under sensor noise, environmental variation, and platform shifts. However, even state-of-the-art methods often degrade under unseen conditions, highlighting the need for robust and generalizable robot sensing. The RoboSense 2025 Challenge is designed to advance robustness and adaptability in robot perception across diverse sensing scenarios. It unifies five complementary research tracks spanning language-grounded decision making, socially compliant navigation, sensor configuration generalization, cross-view and cross-modal correspondence, and cross-platform 3D perception. Together, these tasks form a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating real-world sensing reliability under domain shifts, sensor failures, and platform discrepancies. RoboSense 2025 provides standardized datasets, baseline models, and unified evaluation protocols, enabling large-scale and reproducible comparison of robust perception methods. The challenge attracted 143 teams from 85 institutions across 16 countries, reflecting broad community engagement. By consolidating insights from 23 winning solutions, this report highlights emerging methodological trends, shared design principles, and open challenges across all tracks, marking a step toward building robots that can sense reliably, act robustly, and adapt across platforms in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Offic...</summary><p>Official IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Report; 51 pages, 37 figures, 5 tables; Competition Website at https://robosense2025.github.io/</p></details> |
