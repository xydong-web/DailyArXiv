| **[Importance Sampling Approximation of Sequence Evolution Models with Site-Dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11461v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider models for molecular sequence evolution in which the transition rates at each site depend on the local sequence context, giving rise to a time-inhomogeneous Markov process in which sites evolve under a complex dependency structure. We introduce a randomized approximation algorithm for the marginal sequence likelihood under these models using importance sampling, and provide matching order upper and lower bounds on the finite sample approximation error. Given two sequences of length $n$ with $r$ observed mutations, we show that for practical regimes of $r/n$, the complexity of the importance sampler does not grow exponentially $n$, but rather in $r$, making the algorithm practical for many applied problems. We demonstrate the use of our techniques to obtain problem-specific complexity bounds for a well-known dependent-site model from the phylogenetics literature.</p></details> |  |

In particular, generative AI-led by diffusion models and transformer architectures-has enabled significant breakthroughs in medical imaging (including image reconstruction, image-to-image translation, generation, and classification), protein structure prediction, clinical documentation, diagnostic assistance, radiology interpretation, clinical decision support, medical coding, and billing, as well as drug design and molecular representation. These innovations have enhanced clinical diagnosis, data reconstruction, and drug synthesis. This review paper aims to offer a comprehensive synthesis of recent advances in healthcare applications of generative AI, with an emphasis on diffusion and transformer models. Moreover, we discuss current capabilities, highlight existing limitations, and outline promising research directions to address emerging challenges.

| **[Molecule Mixture Detection and Alphabet Design for Non-linear, Cross-reactive Receiver Arrays in MC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10856v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Air-based molecular communication (MC) has the potential to be one of the first MC systems to be deployed in real-world applications, enabled by existing sensor technologies such as metal-oxide semi-conductor (MOS) sensors. However, commercially available sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive behavior, contrary to the idealizing assumptions about linear and perfectly molecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature. To address this gap, we propose a detector for molecule mixture communication with a general non-linear, cross-reactive receiver (RX) array that performs approximate maximum likelihood detection on the sensor outputs. Additionally, we introduce an algorithm for the design of mixture alphabets that accounts for the RX characteristics. We evaluate our detector and alphabet design algorithm through simulations that are based on measurements reported for two commercial MOS sensors. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed detector achieves similar symbol error rates as data-driven methods without requiring large numbers of training samples and that the alphabet design algorithm outperforms methods that do not account for the RX characteristics. Since the proposed detector and alphabet design algorithm are also applicable to other chemical sensors, they pave the way for reliable air-based MC.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures.

| **[IBEX: Information-Bottleneck-EXplored Coarse-to-Fine Molecular Generation under Limited Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10775v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design. Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to 64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus 3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation error.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Chem3DLLM: 3D Multimodal Large Language Models for Chemistry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10696v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the real world, a molecule is a 3D geometric structure. Compared to 1D SMILES sequences and 2D molecular graphs, 3D molecules represent the most informative molecular modality. Despite the rapid progress of autoregressive-based language models, they cannot handle the generation of 3D molecular conformation due to several challenges: 1) 3D molecular structures are incompatible with LLMs' discrete token space, 2) integrating heterogeneous inputs like proteins, ligands, and text remains difficult within a unified model, and 3) LLMs lack essential scientific priors, hindering the enforcement of physical and chemical constraints during generation. To tackle these issues, we present Chem3DLLM, a unified protein-conditioned multimodal large language model. Our approach designs a novel reversible text encoding for 3D molecular structures using run-length compression, achieving 3x size reduction while preserving complete structural information. This enables seamless integration of molecular geometry with protein pocket features in a single LLM architecture. We employ reinforcement learning with stability-based rewards to optimize chemical validity and incorporate a lightweight protein embedding projector for end-to-end training. Experimental results on structure-based drug design demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with a Vina score of -7.21, validating our unified multimodal approach for practical drug discovery applications.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[$\text{M}^{2}$LLM: Multi-view Molecular Representation Learning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08657v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery. Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that $\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced reasoning processes.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |
| **[A DNN Biophysics Model with Topological and Electrostatic Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03658v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this project, we provide a deep-learning neural network (DNN) based biophysics model to predict protein properties. The model uses multi-scale and uniform topological and electrostatic features generated with protein structural information and force field, which governs the molecular mechanics. The topological features are generated using the element specified persistent homology (ESPH) while the electrostatic features are fast computed using a Cartesian treecode. These features are uniform in number for proteins with various sizes thus the broadly available protein structure database can be used in training the network. These features are also multi-scale thus the resolution and computational cost can be balanced by the users. The machine learning simulation on over 4000 protein structures shows the efficiency and fidelity of these features in representing the protein structure and force field for the predication of their biophysical properties such as electrostatic solvation energy. Tests on topological or electrostatic features alone and the combination of both showed the optimal performance when both features are used. This model shows its potential as a general tool in assisting biophysical properties and function prediction for the broad biomolecules using data from both theoretical computing and experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolSnap: Snap-Fast Molecular Generation with Latent Variational Mean Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05411v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation. Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over diffusion-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Small Step with Fingerprints, One Giant Leap for De Novo Molecule Generation from Mass Spectra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04180v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common approach to the de novo molecular generation problem from mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into molecular structures. In our work, we adopt MIST as the encoder and MolForge as the decoder, leveraging pretraining to enhance performance. Notably, pretraining MolForge proves especially effective, enabling it to serve as a robust fingerprint-to-structure decoder. Additionally, instead of passing the probability of each bit in the fingerprint, thresholding the probabilities as a step function helps focus the decoder on the presence of substructures, improving recovery of accurate molecular structures even when the fingerprints predicted by MIST only moderately resembles the ground truth in terms of Tanimoto similarity. This combination of encoder and decoder results in a tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1 28% / top-10 36% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra. We position this pipeline as a strong baseline for future research in de novo molecule elucidation from mass spectra.</p></details> |  |
| **[Potential Score Matching: Debiasing Molecular Structure Sampling with Potential Energy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14569v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolReasoner: Toward Effective and Interpretable Reasoning for Molecular LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02066v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics, while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT) samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently, Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions, thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[BSL: A Unified and Generalizable Multitask Learning Platform for Virtual Drug Discovery from Design to Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01195v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health, prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced, open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery, offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor, successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery. The platform is accessible at https://www.baishenglai.net.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolPIF: A Parameter Interpolation Flow Model for Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13762v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space. However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore, the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design, demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for model design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Super-resolution Inspired Electron Density Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12335v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drawing inspiration from the domain of image super-resolution, we view the electron density as a 3D grayscale image and use a convolutional residual network to transform a crude and trivially generated guess of the molecular density into an accurate ground-state quantum mechanical density. We find that this model outperforms all prior density prediction approaches. Because the input is itself a real-space density, the predictions are equivariant to molecular symmetry transformations even though the model is not constructed to be. Due to its simplicity, the model is directly applicable to unseen molecular conformations and chemical elements. We show that fine-tuning on limited new data provides high accuracy even in challenging cases of exotic elements and charge states. Our work suggests new routes to learning real-space physical quantities drawing from the established ideas of image processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Representation Condition Improves Equivariant Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03655v4)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in molecular generative models have demonstrated great promise for accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often struggle to generate high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to improve molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared with single-stage generation, the easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second stage generation toward a high-quality molecule in a goal-oriented way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 50\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations. Furthermore, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly reducing the generation iterations needed. Code is available at https://github.com/GraphPKU/GeoRCG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 as a Spotlight Poster</p></details> |

| **[Towards Faithful Class-level Self-explainability in Graph Neural Networks by Subgraph Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11513v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the interpretability of graph neural networks (GNNs) is crucial to ensure their safe and fair deployment. Recent work has introduced self-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving both faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN and PGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway toward class-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely on instance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether these prototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In this paper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN framework designed to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our model jointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs that are discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training that captures graph$\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependencies efficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluation strategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether prior methods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Our results show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superior fidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graph classification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids the computational bottlenecks of previous methods$\unicode{x2014}$like Monte Carlo Tree Search$\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection and lightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training. These findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution for faithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

| **[Diffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15857v6)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. Finally, we explain why diffusion models excel in this regime: their randomized masking objective implicitly trains over a rich distribution of token orderings, acting as an implicit data augmentation that AR's fixed left-to-right factorization lacks. Our results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm. Our code is available at: https://diffusion-scaling.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://diffusion-scaling.github.io</p></details> |
| **[LoRAtorio: An intrinsic approach to LoRA Skill Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11624v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique in text-to-image diffusion models, enabling the personalisation of visual concepts such as characters, styles, and objects. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended settings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in advance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for multi-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is motivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains produce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when operating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base model than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two observations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario, which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method operates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing cosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base model. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight matrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain drift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that incorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We extend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling inference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in ClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises effectively to multiple latent diffusion models.</p></details> | 32 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Dataset Creation for Visual Entailment using Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11605v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we present and validate a new synthetic dataset for training visual entailment models. Existing datasets for visual entailment are small and sparse compared to datasets for textual entailment. Manually creating datasets is labor-intensive. We base our synthetic dataset on the SNLI dataset for textual entailment. We take the premise text from SNLI as input prompts in a generative image model, Stable Diffusion, creating an image to replace each textual premise. We evaluate our dataset both intrinsically and extrinsically. For extrinsic evaluation, we evaluate the validity of the generated images by using them as training data for a visual entailment classifier based on CLIP feature vectors. We find that synthetic training data only leads to a slight drop in quality on SNLI-VE, with an F-score 0.686 compared to 0.703 when trained on real data. We also compare the quality of our generated training data to original training data on another dataset: SICK-VTE. Again, there is only a slight drop in F-score: from 0.400 to 0.384. These results indicate that in settings with data sparsity, synthetic data can be a promising solution for training visual entailment models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NALOM...</summary><p>NALOMA: Natural Logic meets Machine Learning workshop @ ESSLLI 2025</p></details> |
| **[CoreEditor: Consistent 3D Editing via Correspondence-constrained Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11603v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven 3D editing seeks to modify 3D scenes according to textual descriptions, and most existing approaches tackle this by adapting pre-trained 2D image editors to multi-view inputs. However, without explicit control over multi-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-view consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduce CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The key innovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforces precise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughout the diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment, we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enabling more reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. In addition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choose preferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility and user control. Extensive experiments show that CoreEditor produces high-quality, 3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Free Anomaly Generation via Dual-Attention Enhancement in Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11550v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly detection (AD) plays a significant role in manufacturing where a long-standing challenge is data scarcity. A growing body of works have emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However, these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement (CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Informed Diffusion Models for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11528v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a physics-informed diffusion model for multivariate time series data. Over the past years, diffusion model has demonstrated its effectiveness in forecasting, imputation, generation, and anomaly detection in the time series domain. In this paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent temporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted physics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted physics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This approach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data distribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection performance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that physics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it generates better data diversity and log-likelihood. Our model outperforms baseline approaches, additionally, it surpasses prior physics-informed work and purely data-driven diffusion models on a synthetic dataset and one real-world dataset while remaining competitive on others.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Even with scaled-up models and massive datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable, largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing baselines across all criteria.</p></details> | 27 pages, 20 figures |
| **[SPG: Style-Prompting Guidance for Style-Specific Content Creation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11476v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at aligning generated images with textual prompts, controlling the visual style of the output remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose Style-Prompting Guidance (SPG), a novel sampling strategy for style-specific image generation. SPG constructs a style noise vector and leverages its directional deviation from unconditional noise to guide the diffusion process toward the target style distribution. By integrating SPG with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), our method achieves both semantic fidelity and style consistency. SPG is simple, robust, and compatible with controllable frameworks like ControlNet and IPAdapter, making it practical and widely applicable.

| **[Introducing Unbiased Depth into 2D Gaussian Splatting for High-accuracy Surface Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06587v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has demonstrated superior geometry reconstruction quality than the popular 3DGS by using 2D surfels to approximate thin surfaces. However, it falls short when dealing with glossy surfaces, resulting in visible holes in these areas. We find that the reflection discontinuity causes the issue. To fit the jump from diffuse to specular reflection at different viewing angles, depth bias is introduced in the optimized Gaussian primitives. To address that, we first replace the depth distortion loss in 2DGS with a novel depth convergence loss, which imposes a strong constraint on depth continuity. Then, we rectify the depth criterion in determining the actual surface, which fully accounts for all the intersecting Gaussians along the ray. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations across various datasets reveal that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality, with more complete and accurate surfaces than 2DGS.

| **[Simulation-based inference using splitting schemes for partially observed diffusions in chemical reaction networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11438v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of simulation and parameter inference for chemical reaction networks described by the chemical Langevin equation, a stochastic differential equation (SDE) representation of the dynamics of the chemical species. This is challenging for two main reasons. First, the (multi-dimensional) SDEs cannot be explicitly solved and are driven by multiplicative and non-commutative noise, requiring the development of advanced numerical schemes for their approximation and simulation. Second, not all components of the SDEs are directly observed, as the available discrete-time data are typically incomplete and/or perturbed with measurement error. We tackle these issues via three contributions. First, we show that these models can be rewritten as perturbed conditionally Cox-Ingersoll-Ross-type SDEs, i.e., each coordinate, conditioned on all other coordinates being fixed, follows an SDE with linear drift and square root diffusion coefficient perturbed by additional Brownian motions. Second, for this class of SDEs, we develop a numerical splitting scheme that preserves structural properties of the model, such as oscillations, state space and invariant distributions, unlike the commonly used Euler-Maruyama scheme. Our numerical method is robust for large integration time steps. Third, we propose a sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation algorithm incorporating "data-conditional" simulation and sequential learning of summary statistics, allowing inference for multidimensional partially observed systems, further developing previous results on fully observed systems based on the Euler-Maruyama scheme. We validate our approach on models of interest in chemical reaction networks, such as the stochastic Repressilator, Lotka-Volterra, and two-pool systems, demonstrating its effectiveness, in terms of both numerical and inferential accuracy, and reduced computational cost.</p></details> | 35 pages, 7 figures |
| **[KDPE: A Kernel Density Estimation Strategy for Diffusion Policy Trajectory Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10511v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data has been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with generative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on a diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories. While achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that may lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First, the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach, it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms. Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that filters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while keeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation, we propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for actions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper state. KDPE overall achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on simulated single-arm tasks and real robot experiments. Additional material and code are available on our project page at https://hsp-iit.github.io/KDPE/.</p></details> | <details><summary>9th C...</summary><p>9th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025), Seoul, Korea</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Model for Slate Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06883v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Slate generation is a common task in streaming and e-commerce platforms, where multiple items are presented together as a list or ``slate''. Traditional systems focus mostly on item-level ranking and often fail to capture the coherence of the slate as a whole. A key challenge lies in the combinatorial nature of selecting multiple items jointly. To manage this, conventional approaches often assume users interact with only one item at a time, assumption that breaks down when items are meant to be consumed together. In this paper, we introduce DMSG, a generative framework based on diffusion models for prompt-conditioned slate generation. DMSG learns high-dimensional structural patterns and generates coherent, diverse slates directly from natural language prompts. Unlike retrieval-based or autoregressive models, DMSG models the joint distribution over slates, enabling greater flexibility and diversity. We evaluate DMSG in two key domains: music playlist generation and e-commerce bundle creation. In both cases, DMSG produces high-quality slates from textual prompts without explicit personalization signals. Offline and online results show that DMSG outperforms strong baselines in both relevance and diversity, offering a scalable, low-latency solution for prompt-driven recommendation. A live A/B test on a production playlist system further demonstrates increased user engagement and content diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables.

GANDiff FR unifies StyleGAN3-based identity-preserving generation with diffusion-based attribute control, enabling fine-grained manipulation of pose around 30 degrees, illumination (four directions), and expression (five levels) under ceteris paribus conditions. We synthesize 10,000 demographically balanced faces across five cohorts validated for realism via automated detection (98.2%) and human review (89%) to isolate and quantify bias drivers. Benchmarking ArcFace, CosFace, and AdaFace under matched operating points shows AdaFace reduces inter-group TPR disparity by 60% (2.5% vs. 6.3%), with illumination accounting for 42% of residual bias. Cross-dataset evaluation on RFW, BUPT, and CASIA WebFace confirms strong synthetic-to-real transfer (r 0.85). Despite around 20% computational overhead relative to pure GANs, GANDiff FR yields three times more attribute-conditioned variants, establishing a reproducible, regulation-aligned (EU AI Act) standard for fairness auditing. Code and data are released to support transparent, scalable bias evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCVDM '25</p></details> |
| **[Noise Matters: Optimizing Matching Noise for Diffusion Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11330v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising effects with different category conditions to classify categories. Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles, we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good) noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of NoOp.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving fine-grained age editing while preserving personal identity remains a challenging task.In this paper, we propose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate age editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained age editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross attention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related features. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age attributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facial aging.Furthermore, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that predicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising image reconstruction during training. By employing a lightweight module to incorporate age constraints, this design enhances age editing accuracy by modest increasing training cost. Additionally, to address the lack of large-scale, high-quality facial age datasets, we construct a HFFA dataset (High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset) which contains one million high-resolution images labeled with identity and facial attributes. Experimental results demonstrate that TimeMachine achieves state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained age editing while preserving identity consistency.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance often degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints. These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting, transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marmot: Object-Level Self-Correction via Multi-Agent Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20054v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential solution involves employing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to construct a self-correction framework. However, these approaches heavily rely on the capabilities of the MLLMs used, often fail to account for all objects within the image, and suffer from cumulative distortions during multi-round editing processes. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting to enhance image-text alignment. First, we employ a large language model as an Object-Aware Agent to perform object-level divide-and-conquer, automatically decomposing self-correction tasks into object-centric subtasks based on image descriptions. For each subtask, we construct an Object Correction System featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism that operates exclusively on a single object's segmentation mask or the bounding boxes of object pairs, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To efficiently integrate correction results from subtasks while avoiding cumulative distortions from multi-stage editing, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother, which employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtasks, significantly improving runtime efficiency while preventing distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CountCluster: Training-Free Object Quantity Guidance with Cross-Attention Map Clustering for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10710v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose \textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at: https://github.com/JoohyeonL22/CountCluster .</p></details> | Under review |

The deployment of a SNN usually requires partitioning the network and mapping these partitions onto the hardware's processing units. However, finding optimal deployment configurations is an NP-hard problem, often addressed through optimization algorithms. While some objectives (e.g., memory utilization and chip count) are static, others (e.g., communication latency and energy efficiency) depend on the network's dynamic behavior, necessitating dynamic-aware optimization. To address this, we model SNN dynamics using an Ising-type pairwise interaction framework, bridging microscopic neuron interactions with macroscopic network behavior. We optimize deployment by exploring the parameter and configuration spaces of the Ising model. We evaluate our approach on two SNNs deployed on the sPyNNaker neuromorphic platform. Initial results suggest that the method underperforms, potentially due to the Ising model's equilibrium assumptions and the architectural complexity of real-world neuromorphic hardware, highlighting limitations in its current formulation. Update: The method proposed is with a equilibrium-dynamics SNN assumption, and the original paper does not mention this. The paper needs to be revisited and reuploaded after further experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need further experiments for conclusive results</p></details> |

| **[CAPTURe: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Occluded Object Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15485v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty in counting in images.

| **[Rational Inverse Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08983v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can observe a single, imperfect demonstration and immediately generalize to very different problem settings. Robots, in contrast, often require hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the training conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to recover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that these explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of high-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this work, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring these latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR frames few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language model iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a planner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the observed demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over concise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous manipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across variations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one demonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel settings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RS VQA datasets are constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain. RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1 then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises 13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Multimedia Conference (ACM Multimedia 2025)</p></details> |

Such limitation further restricts the model's potential to achieve nuanced visual and language referring in domains such as GUI Agents, counting, \textit{etc}. To address this issue, we introduce a unified high-resolution generalist model, Griffon v2, enabling flexible object referring with visual and textual prompts. To efficiently scale up image resolution, we design a simple and lightweight down-sampling projector to overcome the input tokens constraint in Large Language Models. This design inherently preserves the complete contexts and fine details and significantly improves multimodal perception ability, especially for small objects. Building upon this, we further equip the model with visual-language co-referring capabilities through a plug-and-play visual tokenizer. It enables user-friendly interaction with flexible target images, free-form texts, and even coordinates. Experiments demonstrate that Griffon v2 can localize objects of interest with visual and textual referring, achieve state-of-the-art performance on REC and phrase grounding, and outperform expert models in object detection, object counting, and REG.

Addressing this by annotating new data and fully retraining the model is time-consuming and does not guarantee generalization to additional novel categories at test time. Instead, we propose an alternative paradigm: Given a category name, tune a compact concept embedding derived from the prompt using synthetic images and pseudo-labels generated by a text-to-image diffusion model. This embedding conditions a specialization module that refines raw overcounts from any frozen counter into accurate, category-specific estimates\textemdash without requiring real images or human annotations. We validate our approach on \textsc{Lookalikes}, a challenging new benchmark containing 1,037 images across 27 fine-grained subcategories, and show substantial improvements over strong baselines.

This blind spot severely limits their reliability in real-world applications. To date, this capability has been largely unevaluated in complex scenarios, as existing benchmarks either feature sparse object densities or are confined to specific visual domains, failing to test models under realistic conditions. Addressing this gap, we introduce CountQA, a challenging new benchmark designed to probe this deficiency. Comprising over 1,500 question-answer pairs, CountQA features real-world images with high object density, clutter, and occlusion. We investigate this weakness by evaluating 15 prominent MLLMs on the CountQA benchmark and reveal that the top-performing model achieves a mere 42.9% accuracy, with performance declining as object counts rise. By providing a dedicated benchmark to diagnose and rectify this core weakness, CountQA paves the way for a new generation of MLLMs that are not only descriptively fluent but also numerically grounded and spatially aware. We will open-source the dataset and code upon paper acceptance to foster further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised deep learning model for fast energy layer pre-selection of delivery-efficient proton arc therapy plan optimization of nasopharyngeal carcinoma](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15803v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proton arc therapy (PAT) is an emerging and promising modality in radiotherapy, offering improved dose distribution and treatment robustness over intensity-modulated proton therapy. Yet, identifying the optimal energy layer (EL) sequence remains challenging due to the intensive computational demand and prolonged treatment delivery time. This study proposes an unsupervised deep learning model for fast EL pre-selection that minimizes EL switch (ELS) time while maintaining high plan quality. We introduce a novel data representation method, spot-count representation, which encodes the number of proton spots intersecting the target and organs at risk (OAR) in a matrix structured by sorted gantry angles and energy layers. This representation serves as the input of an U-Net style architecture, SPArc_dl, which is trained using a tri-objective function: maximizing spot-counts on target, minimizing spot-counts on OAR, and reducing ELS time. The model is evaluated on 35 nasopharyngeal cancer cases, and its performance is compared to SPArc_particle_swarm (SPArc_ps). SPArc_dl produces EL pre-selection that significantly improves both plan quality and delivery efficiency. Compared to SPArc_ps, it enhances the conformity index by 0.1 (p<0.01), reduces the homogeneity index by 0.71 (p<0.01), lowers the brainstem mean dose by 0.25 (p<0.01), and shortens the ELS time by 37.2% (p < 0.01). The results unintentionally reveal employing unchanged ELS is more time-wise efficient than descended ELS. SPArc_dl's inference time is within 1 second. However, SPArc_dl plan demonstrates limitation in robustness. The proposed spot-count representation lays a foundation for incorporating unsupervised deep learning approaches into EL pre-selection task. SPArc_dl is a fast tool for generating high-quality PAT plans by strategically pre-selecting EL to reduce delivery time while maintaining excellent dosimetric performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Scoring for Machine Learning Classifier Error Impact Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04489v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample. Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors. Python implementations of the scoring metrics will be available in an open-source repository at time of publication.</p></details> |  |

However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate, real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus, for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data, independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational responses for platform crowding mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 17 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

A core contribution is the 'cardinality' map, a novel regression target that accounts for variations in object size and spatial distribution. Leveraging representation alignment and a hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object count estimation and fine-grained guidance for generative models.

To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations, including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM25 has accepted this paper</p></details> |
| **[Querying Autonomous Vehicle Point Clouds: Enhanced by 3D Object Counting with CounterNet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19209v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data, state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories, resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle to handle the challenge of stacked 3D objects in which most objects are hidden by those above them. To address this important yet underexplored problem, we propose a novel 3D counting approach that decomposes the task into two complementary subproblems - estimating the 3D geometry of the object stack and the occupancy ratio from multi-view images. By combining geometric reconstruction and deep learning-based depth analysis, our method can accurately count identical objects within containers, even when they are irregularly stacked. We validate our 3D Counting pipeline on diverse real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets, which we will release publicly to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV2...</summary><p>ICCV25 Oral.

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

In this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Are Large Pre-trained Vision Language Models Effective Construction Safety Inspectors?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11011v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets, limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques, providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stepwise Decomposition and Dual-stream Focus: A Novel Approach for Training-free Camouflaged Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06818v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2) \textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation, causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream \textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity, while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

However, achieving high geometric precision and editability requires representing figures as graphics programs in languages like TikZ, and aligned training data (i.e., graphics programs with captions) remains scarce. Meanwhile, large amounts of unaligned graphics programs and captioned raster images are more readily available. We reconcile these disparate data sources by presenting TikZero, which decouples graphics program generation from text understanding by using image representations as an intermediary bridge. It enables independent training on graphics programs and captioned images and allows for zero-shot text-guided graphics program synthesis during inference. We show that our method substantially outperforms baselines that can only operate with caption-aligned graphics programs. Furthermore, when leveraging caption-aligned graphics programs as a complementary training signal, TikZero matches or exceeds the performance of much larger models, including commercial systems like GPT-4o. Our code, datasets, and select models are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025 (highlight); Project page: https://github.com/potamides/DeTikZify</p></details> |

Despite their wide application, it is, however, not understood how these models compare their two inputs. Common first-order feature-attribution methods explain importances of individual features and can, thus, only provide limited insights into dual encoders, whose predictions depend on interactions between features. In this paper, we first derive a second-order method enabling the attribution of predictions by any differentiable dual encoder onto feature-interactions between its inputs. Second, we apply our method to Clip models and show that they learn fine-grained correspondences between parts of captions and regions in images. They match objects across input modes and also account for mismatches. This intrinsic visual-linguistic grounding ability, however, varies heavily between object classes, exhibits pronounced out-of-domain effects and we can identify individual errors as well as systematic failure categories.

To address this issue, we introduce a visual comprehension stage, which we call ViCToR (Visual Comprehension via Token Reconstruction), a novel pretraining framework for LMMs. ViCToR employs a learnable visual token pool and utilizes the Hungarian matching algorithm to select semantically relevant tokens from this pool for visual token replacement. Furthermore, by integrating a visual token reconstruction loss with dense semantic supervision, ViCToR can learn tokens which retain high visual detail, thereby enhancing the large language model's (LLM's) understanding of visual information. After pretraining on 3 million publicly accessible images and captions, ViCToR achieves state-of-the-art results, improving over LLaVA-NeXT-8B by 10.4%, 3.2%, and 7.2% on the MMStar, SEED$^I$, and RealWorldQA benchmarks, respectively.

While existing detection methods have achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models, since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images. Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images, which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization, outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and CommunityForensics.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[On the Reliability of Vision-Language Models Under Adversarial Frequency-Domain Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22398v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used as perceptual modules for visual content reasoning, including through captioning and DeepFake detection. In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs, underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Vision-Language Models, Frequency-Domain Perturbations, Adversarial Robustness, Image Authenticity, Reliability</p></details> |

However, training these models requires large-scale datasets, which brings challenges related to efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of web data. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a new data synthesis and curation method for generating image-caption pairs. Unlike traditional methods, where captions are generated from images, SynthVLM utilizes advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to synthesize and select images from text captions, thereby creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. We further introduce SynthVLM-100K, a high-quality dataset consisting of 100K curated and synthesized image-caption pairs. In both model and human evaluations, SynthVLM-100K outperforms traditional real-world datasets. Leveraging this dataset, we develop a new family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B, which achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various vision question-answering (VQA) tasks. Notably, our models outperform LLaVA across most metrics with only 18\% pretrain data. Furthermore, SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B attain SOTA performance on the MMLU benchmark, demonstrating that the high-quality SynthVLM-100K dataset preserves language abilities.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RS VQA datasets are constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain. RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1 then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises 13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Multimedia Conference (ACM Multimedia 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Effortless Vision-Language Model Specialization in Histopathology without Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07835v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in histopathology, such as CONCH and QuiltNet, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification capabilities across various tasks. However, their general-purpose design may lead to suboptimal performance in specific downstream applications. While supervised fine-tuning methods address this issue, they require manually labeled samples for adaptation. This paper investigates annotation-free adaptation of VLMs through continued pretraining on domain- and task-relevant image-caption pairs extracted from existing databases. Our experiments on two VLMs, CONCH and QuiltNet, across three downstream tasks reveal that these pairs substantially enhance both zero-shot and few-shot performance. Notably, with larger training sizes, continued pretraining matches the performance of few-shot methods while eliminating manual labeling. Its effectiveness, task-agnostic design, and annotation-free workflow make it a promising pathway for adapting VLMs to new histopathology tasks.

| **[RORPCap: Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07318v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for input images in an open-form manner. To accurately generate descriptions related to the image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and understand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically capitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection information, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To address these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image Captioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text retrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap employs an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and relation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined prompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping network is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to visual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and visual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature embeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive experiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap requires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5% CIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the "Karpathy" test split. RORPCap achieves comparable performance metrics to detector-based and GCN-based models with the shortest training time and demonstrates its potential as an alternative for image captioning.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose Attention-Guided Image Captioning (AGIC), which amplifies salient visual regions directly in the feature space to guide caption generation. We further introduce a hybrid decoding strategy that combines deterministic and probabilistic sampling to balance fluency and diversity. To evaluate AGIC, we conduct extensive experiments on the Flickr8k and Flickr30k datasets. The results show that AGIC matches or surpasses several state-of-the-art models while achieving faster inference. Moreover, AGIC demonstrates strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for image captioning.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 Figures |

Our crucial technique lies in the design of the reward function to incentivize accurate caption corrections. Specifically, the predicted and reference captions are decomposed into object, attribute, and relation sets using scene-graph parsing algorithms. We calculate the set difference between sets of initial and self-corrected captions to identify added and removed elements. These elements are matched against the reference sets to calculate correctness bonuses for accurate refinements and mistake punishments for wrong additions and removals, thereby forming the final reward. For image caption quality assessment, we propose a set of metrics refined from CAPTURE that alleviate its incomplete precision evaluation and inefficient relation matching problems. Furthermore, we collect a fine-grained annotated image caption dataset, RefinedCaps, consisting of 6.5K diverse images from COCO dataset. Experiments show that applying SC-Captioner on large visual-language models can generate better image captions across various scenarios, significantly outperforming the direct preference optimization training strategy.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Recent studies have explored contrastive decoding as a training-free solution. However, these methods typically construct contrastive visual inputs by perturbing the original image, resulting in distorted contrastive distributions, incomplete contrastive signals, and excessive suppression of language priors. Motivated by the observation that language priors tend to remain consistent across different images, we propose Cross-Image Contrastive Decoding (CICD), a simple yet effective training-free method that uses unrelated images as contrastive visual inputs. To address the issue of over-suppressing language priors, which can negatively affect the quality of generated responses, we further introduce a dynamic selection mechanism based on the cross-image differences in model behavior. By selectively suppressing language priors, our method reduces hallucinations without compromising the model's performance. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of CICD, particularly in image captioning, where language priors are especially dominant.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, their potential for leveraging multi-modal contextual information in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, this paper introduces Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (M$^2$RAG), a benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Multi-modal Large Language Models in leveraging knowledge from multi-modal retrieval documents. The benchmark comprises four tasks: image captioning, multi-modal question answering, multi-modal fact verification, and image reranking. All tasks are set in an open-domain setting, requiring RAG models to retrieve query-relevant information from a multi-modal document collection and use it as contextual input for RAG modeling. To enhance the context utilization capabilities of MLLMs, we also introduce Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Instruction Tuning (MM-RAIT), an instruction tuning method that optimizes MLLMs within multi-modal contexts. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MM-RAIT by significantly improving the quality of responses generated by different RAG models, outperforming MiniCPM-V 2.6 and Qwen2-VL with 34% and 33% gains, respectively.

Despite the success of AI as a service for multi-modal applications, it relies heavily on clouds, which are constrained by bandwidth, latency, privacy concerns, and unavailability under network or server failures. While on-device AI becomes popular, supporting multiple tasks on edge devices imposes significant resource challenges. To address this, we introduce S2M3, a split-and-share multi-modal architecture for multi-task inference on edge devices. Inspired by the general-purpose nature of multi-modal models, which are composed of multiple modules (encoder, decoder, classifier, etc.), we propose to split multi-modal models at functional-level modules; and then share common modules to reuse them across tasks, thereby reducing resource usage. To address cross-model dependency arising from module sharing, we propose a greedy module-level placement with per-request parallel routing by prioritizing compute-intensive modules. Through experiments on a testbed consisting of 14 multi-modal models across 5 tasks and 10 benchmarks, we demonstrate that S2M3 can reduce memory usage by up to 50% and 62% in single-task and multi-task settings, respectively, without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, S2M3 achieves optimal placement in 89 out of 95 instances (93.7%) while reducing inference latency by up to 56.9% on resource-constrained devices, compared to cloud AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[What Holds Back Open-Vocabulary Segmentation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04211v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard segmentation setups are unable to deliver models that can recognize concepts outside the training taxonomy. Open-vocabulary approaches promise to close this gap through language-image pretraining on billions of image-caption pairs. Unfortunately, we observe that the promise is not delivered due to several bottlenecks that have caused the performance to plateau for almost two years. This paper proposes novel oracle components that identify and decouple these bottlenecks by taking advantage of the groundtruth information. The presented validation experiments deliver important empirical findings that provide a deeper insight into the failures of open-vocabulary models and suggest prominent approaches to unlock the future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ICCV 25 Workshop: What is Next in Multimodal Foundation Models?</p></details> |
| **[Dual Prompt Learning for Adapting Vision-Language Models to Downstream Image-Text Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04028v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm, DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7figures |
| **[Landsat30-AU: A Vision-Language Dataset for Australian Landsat Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03127v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term, high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components: Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing $196,262$ image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA, comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and boosts VQA accuracy from 0.74 to 0.87.

Towards Vignette-based Interaction Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10603v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the quality of human-robot interactions has improved with the advent of LLMs, there are still various factors that cause systems to be sub-optimal when compared to human-human interactions. The nature and criticality of failures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be generalized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been implemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique overlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight these failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the methodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on our personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the strength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a multi-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of robots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted from research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing interaction evaluation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the workshop on Real-World HRI in Public and Private Spaces: Successes, Failures, and Lessons Learned (PubRob-Fails), held at the IEEE RO-MAN Conference, 2025. 6 pages</p></details> |

Building on research on fairness and discrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias -- discrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human animals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1) SpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral evaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures comparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation tasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In our benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely condemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On psychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower explicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose to save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that LLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities were equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described as more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In open-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized harm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals. These findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and mainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms around animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment frameworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for reducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes in AI systems and the societies they influence.</p></details> |  |
| **[AFR-CLIP: Enhancing Zero-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection with Stateless-to-Stateful Anomaly Feature Rectification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12910v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for industrial inspection and medical diagnostics, detecting defects in novel objects without requiring any target-dataset samples during training. Existing CLIP-based ZSAD methods generate anomaly maps by measuring the cosine similarity between visual and textual features. However, CLIP's alignment with object categories instead of their anomalous states limits its effectiveness for anomaly detection. To address this limitation, we propose AFR-CLIP, a CLIP-based anomaly feature rectification framework. AFR-CLIP first performs image-guided textual rectification, embedding the implicit defect information from the image into a stateless prompt that describes the object category without indicating any anomalous state. The enriched textual embeddings are then compared with two pre-defined stateful (normal or abnormal) embeddings, and their text-on-text similarity yields the anomaly map that highlights defective regions. To further enhance perception to multi-scale features and complex anomalies, we introduce self prompting (SP) and multi-patch feature aggregation (MPFA) modules. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven anomaly detection benchmarks across industrial and medical domains, demonstrating AFR-CLIP's superiority in ZSAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[OVSegDT: Segmenting Transformer for Open-Vocabulary Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11479v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary Object Goal Navigation requires an embodied agent to reach objects described by free-form language, including categories never seen during training. Existing end-to-end policies overfit small simulator datasets, achieving high success on training scenes but failing to generalize and exhibiting unsafe behaviour (frequent collisions). We introduce OVSegDT, a lightweight transformer policy that tackles these issues with two synergistic components. The first component is the semantic branch, which includes an encoder for the target binary mask and an auxiliary segmentation loss function, grounding the textual goal and providing precise spatial cues. The second component consists of a proposed Entropy-Adaptive Loss Modulation, a per-sample scheduler that continuously balances imitation and reinforcement signals according to the policy entropy, eliminating brittle manual phase switches. These additions cut the sample complexity of training by 33%, and reduce collision count in two times while keeping inference cost low (130M parameters, RGB-only input). On HM3D-OVON, our model matches the performance on unseen categories to that on seen ones and establishes state-of-the-art results (40.1% SR, 20.9% SPL on val unseen) without depth, odometry, or large vision-language models. Code is available at https://github.com/CognitiveAISystems/OVSegDT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulation-based inference using splitting schemes for partially observed diffusions in chemical reaction networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11438v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of simulation and parameter inference for chemical reaction networks described by the chemical Langevin equation, a stochastic differential equation (SDE) representation of the dynamics of the chemical species. This is challenging for two main reasons. First, the (multi-dimensional) SDEs cannot be explicitly solved and are driven by multiplicative and non-commutative noise, requiring the development of advanced numerical schemes for their approximation and simulation. Second, not all components of the SDEs are directly observed, as the available discrete-time data are typically incomplete and/or perturbed with measurement error. We tackle these issues via three contributions. First, we show that these models can be rewritten as perturbed conditionally Cox-Ingersoll-Ross-type SDEs, i.e., each coordinate, conditioned on all other coordinates being fixed, follows an SDE with linear drift and square root diffusion coefficient perturbed by additional Brownian motions. Second, for this class of SDEs, we develop a numerical splitting scheme that preserves structural properties of the model, such as oscillations, state space and invariant distributions, unlike the commonly used Euler-Maruyama scheme. Our numerical method is robust for large integration time steps. Third, we propose a sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation algorithm incorporating "data-conditional" simulation and sequential learning of summary statistics, allowing inference for multidimensional partially observed systems, further developing previous results on fully observed systems based on the Euler-Maruyama scheme. We validate our approach on models of interest in chemical reaction networks, such as the stochastic Repressilator, Lotka-Volterra, and two-pool systems, demonstrating its effectiveness, in terms of both numerical and inferential accuracy, and reduced computational cost.</p></details> | 35 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SAND: One-Shot Feature Selection with Additive Noise Distortion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03923v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature selection is a critical step in data-driven applications, reducing input dimensionality to enhance learning accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Existing state-of-the-art methods often require post-selection retraining and extensive hyperparameter tuning, complicating their adoption. We introduce a novel, non-intrusive feature selection layer that, given a target feature count $k$, automatically identifies and selects the $k$ most informative features during neural network training. Our method is uniquely simple, requiring no alterations to the loss function, network architecture, or post-selection retraining. The layer is mathematically elegant and can be fully described by: \begin{align} \nonumber \tilde{x}_i = a_i x_i + (1-a_i)z_i \end{align} where $x_i$ is the input feature, $\tilde{x}_i$ the output, $z_i$ a Gaussian noise, and $a_i$ trainable gain such that $\sum_i{a_i^2}=k$. This formulation induces an automatic clustering effect, driving $k$ of the $a_i$ gains to $1$ (selecting informative features) and the rest to $0$ (discarding redundant ones) via weighted noise distortion and gain normalization. Despite its extreme simplicity, our method delivers state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets and a novel real-world dataset, outperforming or matching existing approaches without requiring hyperparameter search for $k$ or retraining. Theoretical analysis in the context of linear regression further validates its efficacy. Our work demonstrates that simplicity and performance are not mutually exclusive, offering a powerful yet straightforward tool for feature selection in machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), Vancouver, Canada.

As these models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance 'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained, this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain, often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual recognition tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, there remains a fundamental disconnect between the probabilistic 5G delay characteristics and the often idealistic delay models used to synthesize 5G-TSN network configurations. For time-driven schedules in particular, any delay outlier unforeseen during schedule synthesis can jeopardize the robustness of their real-time guarantees. To address this challenge, we present the (m,k)-firm Elevation Policy to uphold a base level of weakly hard real-time guarantees during unstable network conditions that do not match the expected delay characteristics. It augments the primary time-driven schedule with a dynamic priority-driven scheme to elevate the priority of m out of k consecutive frames if they are delayed. Our evaluations demonstrate that weakly hard real-time guarantees are essential to uphold the quality of control within a networked control system. At the same time, only a small overhead is imposed when the primary schedule can provide stronger quality of service guarantees. Our (m,k)-firm Elevation Policy thereby yields a robust but light-weight fallback mechanism to serve applications with meaningful guarantees during unstable network conditions.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Cross-BCI, A Cross-BCI-Paradigm Classifica-tion Model Towards Universal BCI Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09242v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification models used in brain-computer interface (BCI) are usually designed for a single BCI paradigm. This requires the redevelopment of the model when applying it to a new BCI paradigm, resulting in repeated costs and effort. Moreover, less complex deep learning models are desired for practical usage, as well as for deployment on portable devices. In or-der to fill the above gaps, we, in this study, proposed a light-weight and unified decoding model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification. The proposed model starts with a tempo-spatial convolution. It is followed by a multi-scale local feature selec-tion module, aiming to extract local features shared across BCI paradigms and generate weighted features. Finally, a mul-ti-dimensional global feature extraction module is designed, in which multi-dimensional global features are extracted from the weighted features and fused with the weighted features to form high-level feature representations associated with BCI para-digms. The results, evaluated on a mixture of three classical BCI paradigms (i.e., MI, SSVEP, and P300), demon-strate that the proposed model achieves 88.39%, 82.36%, 80.01%, and 0.8092 for accuracy, macro-precision, mac-ro-recall, and macro-F1-score, respectively, significantly out-performing the compared models. This study pro-vides a feasible solution for cross-BCI-paradigm classifica-tion. It lays a technological foundation for de-veloping a new generation of unified decoding systems, paving the way for low-cost and universal practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ForensicsSAM: Toward Robust and Unified Image Forgery Detection and Localization Resisting to Adversarial Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07402v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular strategy for adapting large vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and LLaVA, to downstream tasks like image forgery detection and localization (IFDL). However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model, without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization.

This works presents the ReQAP system that supports users with answers for complex questions that involve filters, joins and aggregation over heterogeneous sources. The unique trait of ReQAP is that it recursively decomposes questions and incrementally builds an operator tree for execution. Both the question interpretation and the individual operators make smart use of light-weight language models, with judicious fine-tuning. The demo showcases the rich functionality for advanced user questions, and also offers detailed tracking of how the answers are computed by the operators in the execution tree. Being able to trace answers back to the underlying sources is vital for human comprehensibility and user trust in the system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CIKM 2025 (demonstration paper)</p></details> |
| **[Automated Privacy Information Annotation in Large Language Model Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20910v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Users interacting with large language models (LLMs) under their real identifiers often unknowingly risk disclosing private information. Automatically notifying users whether their queries leak privacy and which phrases leak what private information has therefore become a practical need. Existing privacy detection methods, however, were designed for different objectives and application domains, typically tagging personally identifiable information (PII) in anonymous content, which is insufficient in real-name interaction scenarios with LLMs. In this work, to support the development and evaluation of privacy detection models for LLM interactions that are deployable on local user devices, we construct a large-scale multilingual dataset with 249K user queries and 154K annotated privacy phrases. In particular, we build an automated privacy annotation pipeline with strong LLMs to automatically extract privacy phrases from dialogue datasets and annotate leaked information. We also design evaluation metrics at the levels of privacy leakage, extracted privacy phrase, and privacy information. We further establish baseline methods using light-weight LLMs with both tuning-free and tuning-based methods, and report a comprehensive evaluation of their performance. Evaluation results reveal a gap between current performance and the requirements of real-world LLM applications, motivating future research into more effective local privacy detection methods grounded in our dataset.</p></details> | 8 content pages |
| **[Differentially Private Federated Clustering with Random Rebalancing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06183v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated clustering aims to group similar clients into clusters and produce one model for each cluster. Such a personalization approach typically improves model performance compared with training a single model to serve all clients, but can be more vulnerable to privacy leakage. Directly applying client-level differentially private (DP) mechanisms to federated clustering could degrade the utilities significantly. We identify that such deficiencies are mainly due to the difficulties of averaging privacy noise within each cluster (following standard privacy mechanisms), as the number of clients assigned to the same clusters is uncontrolled. To this end, we propose a simple and effective technique, named RR-Cluster, that can be viewed as a light-weight add-on to many federated clustering algorithms. RR-Cluster achieves reduced privacy noise via randomly rebalancing cluster assignments, guaranteeing a minimum number of clients assigned to each cluster. We analyze the tradeoffs between decreased privacy noise variance and potentially increased bias from incorrect assignments and provide convergence bounds for RR-Clsuter. Empirically, we demonstrate the RR-Cluster plugged into strong federated clustering algorithms results in significantly improved privacy/utility tradeoffs across both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | 21 pages |

VISTAR introduces a two-tier hybrid paradigm: it employs deterministic, scriptable metrics for physically quantifiable attributes (e.g., text rendering, lighting) and a novel Hierarchical Weighted P/N Questioning (HWPQ) scheme that uses constrained vision-language models to assess abstract semantics (e.g., style fusion, cultural fidelity). Grounded in a Delphi study with 120 experts, we defined seven user roles and nine evaluation angles to construct the benchmark, which comprises 2,845 prompts validated by over 15,000 human pairwise comparisons. Our metrics achieve high human alignment (>75%), with the HWPQ scheme reaching 85.9% accuracy on abstract semantics, significantly outperforming VQA baselines. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals no universal champion, as role-weighted scores reorder rankings and provide actionable guidance for domain-specific deployment. All resources are publicly released to foster reproducible T2I assessment.</p></details> | 17 pages,8 figures |
| **[Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators (FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion) parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of tokens for both.

However, this paradigm faces fundamental challenges: subjective tasks often lack absolute ground truth, and sparse annotation coverage makes aggregation statistically unreliable. We introduce a paradigm shift from sample-wise aggregation to annotator-wise behavior modeling. By treating annotator disagreements as valuable information rather than noise, modeling annotator-specific behavior patterns can reconstruct unlabeled data to reduce annotation cost, enhance aggregation reliability, and explain annotator decision behavior. To this end, we propose QuMAB (Query-based Multi-Annotator Behavior Pattern Learning), which uses light-weight queries to model individual annotators while capturing inter-annotator correlations as implicit regularization, preventing overfitting to sparse individual data while maintaining individualization and improving generalization, with a visualization of annotator focus regions offering an explainable analysis of behavior understanding. We contribute two large-scale datasets with dense per-annotator labels: STREET (4,300 labels/annotator) and AMER (average 3,118 labels/annotator), the first multimodal multi-annotator dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our QuMAB in modeling individual annotators' behavior patterns, their utility for consensus prediction, and applicability under sparse annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.15237</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking the Potential of MLLMs in Referring Expression Segmentation via a Light-weight Mask Decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04107v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding, their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction. Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost.

However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise. To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed, and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community contributions and dataset evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-aware Risk Assessment and Its Application in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02919v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires precise, real-time risk assessment and adaptive behavior. Prior work on risk estimation either outputs coarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes indicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses narrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk Index (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks based on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting control commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning within a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) principles, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation, and an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate CRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using a state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our collision-rate metrics show a 19\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions per failed route, a 20\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a 17\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically significant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6 ms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially improves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while maintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.</p></details> | ITSC 2025, 7 pages |

While recent advances in large language models have greatly improved performance, most existing approaches depend on models with tens of billions of parameters or costly APIs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments. For real world, especially on edge devices, it is crucial for Text-to-SQL to ensure cost-effectiveness. Therefore, enabling the light-weight models for Text-to-SQL is of great practical significance. However, smaller LLMs often struggle with complicated user instruction, redundant schema linking or syntax correctness. To address these challenges, we propose MCTS-SQL, a novel framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide SQL generation through multi-step refinement. Since the light-weight models' weak performance of single-shot prediction, we generate better results through several trials with feedback. However, directly applying MCTS-based methods inevitably leads to significant time and computational overhead. Driven by this issue, we propose a token-level prefix-cache mechanism that stores prior information during iterations, effectively improved the execution speed. Experiments results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using a small open-source Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B, our method outperforms ChatGPT-3.5. When leveraging a more powerful model Gemini 2.5 to explore the performance upper bound, we achieved results competitive with the SOTA. Our findings demonstrate that even small models can be effectively deployed in practical Text-to-SQL systems with the right strategy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

However, current learning-based methods often struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency: methods that achieve high accuracy typically demand substantial processing power, while faster approaches tend to sacrifice precision. These fast approaches specifically falter in their generalization capabilities and do not perform well across diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we revisit the limitations of the SOTA methods and present NeuFlow-V2, a novel method that offers both - high accuracy in real-world datasets coupled with low computational overhead. In particular, we introduce a novel light-weight backbone and a fast refinement module to keep computational demands tractable while delivering accurate optical flow. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NeuFlow-V2 provides similar accuracy to SOTA methods while achieving 10x-70x speedups. It is capable of running at over 20 FPS on 512x384 resolution images on a Jetson Orin Nano.

| **[Light-Weight Diffusion Multiplier and Uncertainty Quantification for Fourier Neural Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00643v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operator learning is a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential equations, with Fourier Neural Operators serving as a widely adopted foundation. However, FNOs face significant scalability challenges due to overparameterization and offer no native uncertainty quantification -- a key requirement for reliable scientific and engineering applications. Instead, neural operators rely on post hoc UQ methods that ignore geometric inductive biases. In this work, we introduce DINOZAUR: a diffusion-based neural operator parametrization with uncertainty quantification. Inspired by the structure of the heat kernel, DINOZAUR replaces the dense tensor multiplier in FNOs with a dimensionality-independent diffusion multiplier that has a single learnable time parameter per channel, drastically reducing parameter count and memory footprint without compromising predictive performance. By defining priors over those time parameters, we cast DINOZAUR as a Bayesian neural operator to yield spatially correlated outputs and calibrated uncertainty estimates. Our method achieves competitive or superior performance across several PDE benchmarks while providing efficient uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we present an autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) system which purely relies on cost-effective and light-weight passive visual and inertial sensors to perform large-scale autonomous navigation in outdoor,unstructured and cluttered environments. We leverage visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) for accurate MAV state estimates and couple it with a volumetric occupancy submapping system to achieve a scalable mapping framework which can be directly used for path planning. To ensure the safety of the MAV during navigation, we also propose a novel reference trajectory anchoring scheme that deforms the reference trajectory the MAV is tracking upon state updates from the VI-SLAM system in a consistent way, even upon large state updates due to loop-closures. We thoroughly validate our system in both real and simulated forest environments and at peak velocities up to 3 m/s while not encountering a single collision or system failure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system which achieves this level of performance in such an unstructured environment using low-cost passive visual sensors and fully on-board computation, including VI-SLAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Specifically, it takes in 32 input images at a resolution of 960x540 and produces the Gaussian reconstruction in just 1 second on a single A100 GPU. To handle the long sequence of 250K tokens brought by the large input size, Long-LRM features a mixture of the recent Mamba2 blocks and the classical transformer blocks, enhanced by a light-weight token merging module and Gaussian pruning steps that balance between quality and efficiency. We evaluate Long-LRM on the large-scale DL3DV benchmark and Tanks&Temples, demonstrating reconstruction quality comparable to the optimization-based methods while achieving an 800x speedup w.r.t. the optimization-based approaches and an input size at least 60x larger than the previous feed-forward approaches. We conduct extensive ablation studies on our model design choices for both rendering quality and computation efficiency. We also explore Long-LRM's compatibility with other Gaussian variants such as 2D GS, which enhances Long-LRM's ability in geometry reconstruction.

Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 ICCV Highlight paper, 17 pages including supplementary material</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Incremental Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09974v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph incremental learning is a learning paradigm that aims to adapt trained models to continuously incremented graphs and data over time without the need for retraining on the full dataset. However, regular graph machine learning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental learning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new knowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the previously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to maintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however, do not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different timestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns can be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the new data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic mixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a DyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming data blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data sequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve old tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the number of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full mixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a sparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make predictions, significantly reducing the computation time. Our model achieved 4.92\% relative accuracy increase compared to the best baselines on class incremental learning, showing the model's exceptional power.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSS-Prompt: Dynamic-Static Synergistic Prompting for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09785v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization ability has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks recently, but it is still underexplored in the challenging few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) task. It aims to continually learn new concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely, we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic forgetting issue as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACMMM 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances in this field have shifted towards parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, with many approaches building upon the framework that maintains a pool of learnable prompts. Although effective, these methods introduce substantial computational overhead, primarily due to prompt pool querying and increased input sequence lengths from prompt concatenation. In this work, we present a novel prompt-based approach that addresses this limitation. Our method trains a single set of shared prompts across all tasks and, rather than concatenating prompts to the input, directly modifies the CLS token's attention computation by adding the prompts to it. This simple and lightweight design not only significantly reduces computational complexity-both in terms of inference costs and the number of trainable parameters-but also eliminates the need to optimize prompt lengths for different downstream tasks, offering a more efficient yet powerful solution for rehearsal-free class-incremental learning. Extensive experiments across a diverse range of CIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to establish a new prompt-based CIL paradigm. Furthermore, experiments on general recognition benchmarks beyond the CIL setting also show strong performance, positioning our method as a promising candidate for a general parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach.</p></details> |  |

However, the vulnerability of the models against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation. Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks.

| **[Multi-level Collaborative Distillation Meets Global Workspace Model: A Unified Framework for OCIL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08677v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective. While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared, implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch, capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models across various memory budgets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

Existing pre-trained model-based CIL methods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks using additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect module selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules often overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing between similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this paper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most crucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter. Furthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal adapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks. We combine task-specific and universal adapter predictions to harness both specialized and general knowledge during inference.

However, segmentation models trained on static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work, we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than 144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an evaluation benchmark.

Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods can effectively distinguish between known and unknown classes in the data, while incremental learning enables continuous model knowledge updates. However, in open-world scenarios, these approaches still face limitations. Relying solely on OOD detection does not facilitate knowledge updates in the model, and incremental fine-tuning typically requires supervised conditions, which significantly deviate from open-world settings. To address these challenges, this paper proposes OpenHAIV, a novel framework that integrates OOD detection, new class discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning into a unified pipeline.

Continual learning is supposed to help train models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection). Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MICCAI 2025 workshop on Efficient Medical AI</p></details> |
| **[Sculpting Margin Penalty: Intra-Task Adapter Merging and Classifier Calibration for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05094v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL). However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200 demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning New Concepts, Remembering the Old: Continual Learning for Multimodal Concept Bottleneck Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17471v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance the interpretability of AI systems, particularly by bridging visual input with human-understandable concepts, effectively acting as a form of multimodal interpretability model. However, existing CBMs typically assume static datasets, which fundamentally limits their adaptability to real-world, continuously evolving multimodal data streams. To address this, we define a novel continual learning task for CBMs: simultaneously handling concept-incremental and class-incremental learning. This task requires models to continuously acquire new concepts (often representing cross-modal attributes) and classes while robustly preserving previously learned knowledge. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose CONceptual Continual Incremental Learning (CONCIL), a novel framework that fundamentally re-imagines concept and decision layer updates as linear regression problems. This reformulation eliminates the need for gradient-based optimization, thereby effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, CONCIL relies solely on recursive matrix operations, rendering it highly computationally efficient and well-suited for real-time and large-scale multimodal data applications. Experimental results compellingly demonstrate that CONCIL achieves "absolute knowledge memory" and significantly surpasses the performance of traditional CBM methods in both concept- and class-incremental settings, thus establishing a new paradigm for continual learning in CBMs, particularly valuable for dynamic multimodal understanding.</p></details> |  |

Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study, we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Recently, replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this, exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other replay-based methods, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However, these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we introduce PESCR, a novel approach that substantially increases the quantity and enhances the diversity of exemplars based on a pre-trained general-purpose diffusion model, without fine-tuning it on target datasets or storing it in the memory buffer. Images are compressed into visual and textual prompts, which are saved instead of the original images, decreasing memory consumption by a factor of 24. In subsequent phases, diverse exemplars are regenerated by the diffusion model. We further propose partial compression and diffusion-based data augmentation to minimize the domain gap between generated exemplars and real images. PESCR significantly improves CIL performance across multiple benchmarks, e.g., 3.2% above the previous state-of-the-art on ImageNet-100.</p></details> | <details><summary>BMVC ...</summary><p>BMVC 2025.

| **[RainbowPrompt: Diversity-Enhanced Prompt-Evolving for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22553v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods across all scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[CLoRA: Parameter-Efficient Continual Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19887v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past, continual learning (CL) was mostly concerned with the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, that arises when incrementally learning a sequence of tasks. Current CL methods function within the confines of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA, we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CoLLAs 2025</p></details> |
| **[External Knowledge Injection for CLIP-Based Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08510v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables learning systems to continuously adapt to evolving data streams. With the advancement of pre-training, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) offers a promising starting point for CIL. However, CLIP makes decisions by matching visual embeddings to class names, overlooking the rich contextual information conveyed through language. For instance, the concept of ``cat'' can be decomposed into features like tail, fur, and face for recognition. Besides, since the model is continually updated, these detailed features are overwritten in CIL, requiring external knowledge for compensation. In this paper, we introduce ExterNal knowledGe INjEction (ENGINE) for CLIP-based CIL. To enhance knowledge transfer from outside the dataset, we propose a dual-branch injection tuning framework that encodes informative knowledge from both visual and textual modalities. The visual branch is enhanced with data augmentation to enrich the visual features, while the textual branch leverages GPT-4 to rewrite discriminative descriptors. In addition to this on-the-fly knowledge injection, we also implement post-tuning knowledge by re-ranking the prediction results during inference. With the injected knowledge, the model can better capture informative features for downstream tasks as data evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ENGINE.
