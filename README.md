| **[A Hands-On Molecular Communication Testbed for Undergraduate Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01904v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a hands-on molecular communication (MC) testbed developed for the undergraduate Communication Engineering lab course at the Institute for Communications Technology (IfN), TU~Braunschweig. The goal of the experiment is to provide students with an intuitive and reproducible introduction to MC concepts using a low-cost and accessible fluidic setup. The system employs a background water flow into which three dye colors are injected and symbols are detected by a multi-wavelength photosensor. A zero-forcing--based estimator is used to separate the spectral components and reliably identify the transmitted colors. The experiment is designed to be completed independently by students within a single laboratory session and requires only basic prior knowledge from introductory communication engineering courses. A detailed script accompanies the experiment, guiding students through channel characterization, color detection, pseudoinverse computation, and simple data transmission using on-off keying. In pilot trials, students successfully reproduced the entire communication chain and achieved stable data rates of up to 0.5~bit/s over a 15~cm channel. The proposed testbed demonstrates that fundamental principles of MC can be taught effectively using a compact and inexpensive experimental setup. The experiment will be integrated into an undergraduate lab course.</p></details> |  |

| **[DYNEMO-SLAM: Dynamic Entity and Motion-Aware 3D Scene Graph SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02050v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots operating in dynamic environments face significant challenges due to the presence of moving agents and displaced objects. Traditional SLAM systems typically assume a static world or treat dynamic as outliers, discarding their information to preserve map consistency. As a result, they cannot exploit dynamic entities as persistent landmarks, do not model and exploit their motion over time, and therefore quickly degrade in highly cluttered environments with few reliable static features. This paper presents a novel 3D scene graph-based SLAM framework that addresses the challenge of modeling and estimating the pose of dynamic entities into the SLAM backend. Our framework incorporates semantic motion priors and dynamic entity-aware constraints to jointly optimize the robot trajectory, dynamic entity poses, and the surrounding environment structure within a unified graph formulation. In parallel, a dynamic keyframe selection policy and a semantic loop-closure prefiltering step enable the system to remain robust and effective in highly dynamic environments by continuously adapting to scene changes and filtering inconsistent observations. The simulation and real-world experimental results show a 49.97% reduction in ATE compared to the baseline method employed, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating dynamic entities and estimating their poses for improved robustness and richer scene representation in complex scenarios while maintaining real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Minimax Hypothesis Testing for the Bradley-Terry-Luce Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08360v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is one of the most widely used models for ranking a collection of items or agents based on pairwise comparisons among them. Given $n$ agents, the BTL model endows each agent $i$ with a latent skill score $α_i > 0$ and posits that the probability that agent $i$ is preferred over agent $j$ is $α_i/(α_i + α_j)$. In this work, our objective is to formulate a hypothesis test that determines whether a given pairwise comparison dataset, with $k$ comparisons per pair of agents, originates from an underlying BTL model. We formalize this testing problem in the minimax sense and define the critical threshold of the problem. We then establish upper bounds on the critical threshold for general induced observation graphs (satisfying mild assumptions) and develop lower bounds for complete induced graphs. Our bounds demonstrate that for complete induced graphs, the critical threshold scales as $Θ((nk)^{-1/2})$ in a minimax sense. In particular, our test statistic for the upper bounds is based on a new approximation we derive for the separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of BTL models. To further assess the performance of our statistical test, we prove upper bounds on the type I and type II probabilities of error. Much of our analysis is conducted within the context of a fixed observation graph structure, where the graph possesses certain ``nice'' properties, such as expansion and bounded principal ratio. Additionally, we derive several auxiliary results, such as bounds on principal ratios of graphs, $\ell^2$-bounds on BTL parameter estimation under model mismatch, stability of rankings under the BTL model, etc. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets and propose a data-driven permutation testing approach to determine test thresholds.</p></details> | 41 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Morphling: Fast, Fused, and Flexible GNN Training at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01678v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a fundamental hardware challenge by fusing irregular, memory-bound graph traversals with regular, compute-intensive dense matrix operations. While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. The results show that Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs and 19X on GPUs over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware. These findings demonstrate that specialized, architecture-aware code synthesis provides an effective and scalable path toward high-performance GNN execution across diverse parallel and distributed platforms.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learning Multimodal Embeddings for Traffic Accident Prediction and Causal Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02920v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages.

| **[Glance: Accelerating Diffusion Models with 1 Sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02899v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavy computational cost and the need for numerous inference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion transformers excel at holistic generation, their use of singular, monolithic prompts fails to disentangle distinct user intentions for content, position, and appearance. To overcome this, our method deconstructs creative intent into a stack of controllable visual cues: a content layer for what to create, a spatial layer for where to place it, a structural layer for how it is shaped, and a color layer for its palette. Our technical contributions include a specialized data generation pipeline for context-aware content integration, a unified control module to process all visual cues, and a fine-tuned spatial branch for precise local editing, including object removal. Extensive experiments validate that this layered approach effectively resolves the user intention gap, granting creators direct, intuitive control over the generative process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and demo available at https://magicquill.art/v2/</p></details> |

In this work, we first verify that the attention maps of these models acquire geometric correspondence throughout training, attending to the geometrically corresponding regions across reference and target views for view-consistent generation. However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models. Notably, supervising a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, thereby preserving the geometry and structure of reference images, accelerating convergence, and improving novel view synthesis performance. CAMEO reduces the number of training iterations required for convergence by half while achieving superior performance at the same iteration counts. We further demonstrate that CAMEO is model-agnostic and can be applied to any multi-view diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/CAMEO/</p></details> |
| **[Video2Act: A Dual-System Video Diffusion Policy with Robotic Spatio-Motional Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03044v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust perception and dynamics modeling are fundamental to real-world robotic policy learning. Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we present Video4Spatial, a framework showing that video diffusion models conditioned solely on video-based scene context can perform complex spatial tasks. We validate on two tasks: scene navigation - following camera-pose instructions while remaining consistent with 3D geometry of the scene, and object grounding - which requires semantic localization, instruction following, and planning. Both tasks use video-only inputs, without auxiliary modalities such as depth or poses. With simple yet effective design choices in the framework and data curation, Video4Spatial demonstrates strong spatial understanding from video context: it plans navigation and grounds target objects end-to-end, follows camera-pose instructions while maintaining spatial consistency, and generalizes to long contexts and out-of-domain environments. Taken together, these results advance video generative models toward general visuospatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://xizaoqu.github.io/video4spatial/</p></details> |

Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project website is https://carlyx.github.io/MAViD/</p></details> |

Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMP across a diverse suite of control tasks with physically simulated humanoid characters.

Recent methods accelerate MRI by under-sampling $k$-space and reconstructing the resulting images using deep learning. Unrolled networks have been widely used for the reconstruction task due to their efficiency, but suffer from unstable evolving caused by freely-learnable parameters in intermediate steps. In contrast, diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations offer theoretical stability in both medical and natural image tasks but are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce flow ODEs to MRI reconstruction by theoretically proving that unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs. This connection provides explicit formulations for parameters and clarifies how intermediate states should evolve. Building on this insight, we propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which derives unrolled parameters from the ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal ODE trajectory to improve stability and convergence. Experiments on three MRI datasets show that FLAT achieves high-quality reconstructions with up to $3\times$ fewer iterations than diffusion-based generative models and significantly greater stability than unrolled networks.</p></details> |  |

The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sagipolaczek.github.io/Sync-LoRA/</p></details> |

We revisit this problem from a feedforward perspective and introduce \textbf{Driving Gaussian Grounded Transformer (DGGT)}, a unified framework for pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction. We note that the existing formulations, treating camera pose as a required input, limit flexibility and scalability. Instead, we reformulate pose as an output of the model, enabling reconstruction directly from sparse, unposed images and supporting an arbitrary number of views for long sequences. Our approach jointly predicts per-frame 3D Gaussian maps and camera parameters, disentangles dynamics with a lightweight dynamic head, and preserves temporal consistency with a lifespan head that modulates visibility over time. A diffusion-based rendering refinement further reduces motion/interpolation artifacts and improves novel-view quality under sparse inputs. The result is a single-pass, pose-free algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance and speed. Trained and evaluated on large-scale driving benchmarks (Waymo, nuScenes, Argoverse2), our method outperforms prior work both when trained on each dataset and in zero-shot transfer across datasets, and it scales well as the number of input frames increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruction-based Time Series Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01504v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute- and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to unseen conditions through few-shot learning.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, we introduce TEXTRIX, a native 3D attribute generation framework for high-fidelity texture synthesis and downstream applications such as precise 3D part segmentation. Our approach constructs a latent 3D attribute grid and leverages a Diffusion Transformer equipped with sparse attention, enabling direct coloring of 3D models in volumetric space and fundamentally avoiding the limitations of multi-view fusion. Built upon this native representation, the framework naturally extends to high-precision 3D segmentation by training the same architecture to predict semantic attributes on the grid. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures and accurate 3D part segmentation with precise boundaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://www.neural4d.com/research-page/textrix</p></details> |

In contrast, we advocate for a primitive-based paradigm where urban scenes are represented using compact, semantically meaningful 3D elements that are easy to manipulate and compose. To this end, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion model that leverages vectorized object primitives and rasterized ground surfaces for generating diverse, controllable, and editable 3D semantic urban scenes. This hybrid representation yields a structured latent space that facilitates object- and ground-level manipulation. Experiments on KITTI-360 show that primitive-based representations unlock the full capabilities of diffusion transformers, achieving state-of-the-art 3D scene generation quality with lower memory requirements, faster inference, and greater editability than voxel-based methods. Beyond generation, PrITTI supports a range of downstream applications, including scene editing, inpainting, outpainting, and photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 19 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

A Synthetic Benchmark and Analysis of Attention-Based Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17722v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research suggests that Vision Language Models (VLMs) often rely on inherent biases learned during training when responding to queries about visual properties of images. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly specific questions that require them to focus on particular areas of the image in tasks such as counting. We build upon this research by developing a synthetic benchmark dataset and evaluation framework to systematically determine how counting performance varies as image and prompt properties change. Using open-source VLMs, we then analyze how attention allocation fluctuates with varying input parameters (e.g. number of objects in the image, objects color, background color, objects texture, background texture, and prompt specificity). We further implement attention-based interventions to modulate focus on visual tokens at different layers and evaluate their impact on counting performance across a range of visual conditions. Our experiments reveal that while VLM counting performance remains challenging, especially under high visual or linguistic complexity, certain attention interventions can lead to modest gains in counting performance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional SLAM systems typically assume a static world or treat dynamic as outliers, discarding their information to preserve map consistency. As a result, they cannot exploit dynamic entities as persistent landmarks, do not model and exploit their motion over time, and therefore quickly degrade in highly cluttered environments with few reliable static features. This paper presents a novel 3D scene graph-based SLAM framework that addresses the challenge of modeling and estimating the pose of dynamic entities into the SLAM backend. Our framework incorporates semantic motion priors and dynamic entity-aware constraints to jointly optimize the robot trajectory, dynamic entity poses, and the surrounding environment structure within a unified graph formulation. In parallel, a dynamic keyframe selection policy and a semantic loop-closure prefiltering step enable the system to remain robust and effective in highly dynamic environments by continuously adapting to scene changes and filtering inconsistent observations. The simulation and real-world experimental results show a 49.97% reduction in ATE compared to the baseline method employed, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating dynamic entities and estimating their poses for improved robustness and richer scene representation in complex scenarios while maintaining real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Given $n$ agents, the BTL model endows each agent $i$ with a latent skill score $α_i > 0$ and posits that the probability that agent $i$ is preferred over agent $j$ is $α_i/(α_i + α_j)$. In this work, our objective is to formulate a hypothesis test that determines whether a given pairwise comparison dataset, with $k$ comparisons per pair of agents, originates from an underlying BTL model. We formalize this testing problem in the minimax sense and define the critical threshold of the problem. We then establish upper bounds on the critical threshold for general induced observation graphs (satisfying mild assumptions) and develop lower bounds for complete induced graphs. Our bounds demonstrate that for complete induced graphs, the critical threshold scales as $Θ((nk)^{-1/2})$ in a minimax sense. In particular, our test statistic for the upper bounds is based on a new approximation we derive for the separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of BTL models. To further assess the performance of our statistical test, we prove upper bounds on the type I and type II probabilities of error. Much of our analysis is conducted within the context of a fixed observation graph structure, where the graph possesses certain ``nice'' properties, such as expansion and bounded principal ratio. Additionally, we derive several auxiliary results, such as bounds on principal ratios of graphs, $\ell^2$-bounds on BTL parameter estimation under model mismatch, stability of rankings under the BTL model, etc. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets and propose a data-driven permutation testing approach to determine test thresholds.</p></details> | 41 pages, 5 figures |

Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Based Diagnosis with Multiple Observations: A Unified Approach for C Software and Boolean Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02898v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is one of the most time-consuming and expensive tasks in software development and circuit design. Several formula-based fault localisation (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs/circuits with multiple faults. This paper introduces CFaults, a novel fault localisation tool for C software and Boolean circuits with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localisation procedure. Experimental results on three benchmark sets, two of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, and one of Boolean circuits, ISCAS85, show that CFaults is faster at localising faults in C software than other FBFL approaches such as BugAssist, SNIPER, and HSD. On the ISCAS85 benchmark, CFaults is generally slower than HSD; however, it localises faults in only 6% fewer circuits, demonstrating that it remains competitive in this domain. Furthermore, CFaults produces only subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses (e.g., BugAssist and SNIPER).</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables, 5 listings</p></details> |

However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist. All code, model, and data are released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/tulerfeng/OneThinker</p></details> |

To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiShotMaster, a framework for highly controllable multi-shot video generation. We extend a pretrained single-shot model by integrating two novel variants of RoPE. First, we introduce Multi-Shot Narrative RoPE, which applies explicit phase shift at shot transitions, enabling flexible shot arrangement while preserving the temporal narrative order. Second, we design Spatiotemporal Position-Aware RoPE to incorporate reference tokens and grounding signals, enabling spatiotemporal-grounded reference injection. In addition, to overcome data scarcity, we establish an automated data annotation pipeline to extract multi-shot videos, captions, cross-shot grounding signals and reference images. Our framework leverages the intrinsic architectural properties to support multi-shot video generation, featuring text-driven inter-shot consistency, customized subject with motion control, and background-driven customized scene. Both shot count and duration are flexibly configurable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and outstanding controllability of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://qinghew.github.io/MultiShotMaster</p></details> |

This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training. Our experiments validate our approach on several vision tasks including denoising (NAFNet), image enhancement (HDRNet), monocular depth (Depth Anything v2), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabv3+). Our method improves temporal stability and robustness against a range of image corruptions (including compression artifacts, noise, and adverse weather), while preserving or improving the quality of predictions.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

We propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li}_2$, that captures three key stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature learning. At the lazy learning stage, top layer overfits to random hidden representation and the model appears to memorize, and at the same time, the backpropagated gradient $G_F$ from the top layer now carries information about the target label, with a specific structure that enables each hidden node to learn their representation independently. Interestingly, the independent dynamics follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. When hidden nodes start to interact in the later stage of learning, we provably show how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of feature emergence, memorization and generalization, and reveals why recent optimizers such as Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our analysis can be extended to multi-layers.

Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.</p></details> |  |

Several formula-based fault localisation (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs/circuits with multiple faults. This paper introduces CFaults, a novel fault localisation tool for C software and Boolean circuits with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localisation procedure. Experimental results on three benchmark sets, two of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, and one of Boolean circuits, ISCAS85, show that CFaults is faster at localising faults in C software than other FBFL approaches such as BugAssist, SNIPER, and HSD. On the ISCAS85 benchmark, CFaults is generally slower than HSD; however, it localises faults in only 6% fewer circuits, demonstrating that it remains competitive in this domain. Furthermore, CFaults produces only subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses (e.g., BugAssist and SNIPER).</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables, 5 listings</p></details> |

| **[The Complexity of Contracting Bipartite Graphs into Small Cycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07358v3)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a positive integer $\ell \geq 3$, the $C_\ell$-Contractibility problem takes as input an undirected simple graph $G$ and determines whether $G$ can be transformed into a graph isomorphic to $C_\ell$ (the induced cycle on $\ell$ vertices) using only edge contractions. Brouwer and Veldman [JGT 1987] showed that $C_4$-Contractibility is NP-complete in general graphs. It is easy to verify that $C_3$-Contractibility is polynomial-time solvable. Dabrowski and Paulusma [IPL 2017] showed that $C_{\ell}$-Contractibility is \NP-complete\ on bipartite graphs for $\ell = 6$ and posed as open problems the status of the problem when $\ell$ is 4 or 5. In this paper, we show that both $C_5$-Contractibility and $C_4$-Contractibility are NP-complete on bipartite graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[DYNEMO-SLAM: Dynamic Entity and Motion-Aware 3D Scene Graph SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02050v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots operating in dynamic environments face significant challenges due to the presence of moving agents and displaced objects. Traditional SLAM systems typically assume a static world or treat dynamic as outliers, discarding their information to preserve map consistency. As a result, they cannot exploit dynamic entities as persistent landmarks, do not model and exploit their motion over time, and therefore quickly degrade in highly cluttered environments with few reliable static features. This paper presents a novel 3D scene graph-based SLAM framework that addresses the challenge of modeling and estimating the pose of dynamic entities into the SLAM backend. Our framework incorporates semantic motion priors and dynamic entity-aware constraints to jointly optimize the robot trajectory, dynamic entity poses, and the surrounding environment structure within a unified graph formulation. In parallel, a dynamic keyframe selection policy and a semantic loop-closure prefiltering step enable the system to remain robust and effective in highly dynamic environments by continuously adapting to scene changes and filtering inconsistent observations. The simulation and real-world experimental results show a 49.97% reduction in ATE compared to the baseline method employed, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating dynamic entities and estimating their poses for improved robustness and richer scene representation in complex scenarios while maintaining real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Minimax Hypothesis Testing for the Bradley-Terry-Luce Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08360v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is one of the most widely used models for ranking a collection of items or agents based on pairwise comparisons among them. Given $n$ agents, the BTL model endows each agent $i$ with a latent skill score $α_i > 0$ and posits that the probability that agent $i$ is preferred over agent $j$ is $α_i/(α_i + α_j)$. In this work, our objective is to formulate a hypothesis test that determines whether a given pairwise comparison dataset, with $k$ comparisons per pair of agents, originates from an underlying BTL model. We formalize this testing problem in the minimax sense and define the critical threshold of the problem. We then establish upper bounds on the critical threshold for general induced observation graphs (satisfying mild assumptions) and develop lower bounds for complete induced graphs. Our bounds demonstrate that for complete induced graphs, the critical threshold scales as $Θ((nk)^{-1/2})$ in a minimax sense. In particular, our test statistic for the upper bounds is based on a new approximation we derive for the separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of BTL models. To further assess the performance of our statistical test, we prove upper bounds on the type I and type II probabilities of error. Much of our analysis is conducted within the context of a fixed observation graph structure, where the graph possesses certain ``nice'' properties, such as expansion and bounded principal ratio. Additionally, we derive several auxiliary results, such as bounds on principal ratios of graphs, $\ell^2$-bounds on BTL parameter estimation under model mismatch, stability of rankings under the BTL model, etc. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets and propose a data-driven permutation testing approach to determine test thresholds.</p></details> | 41 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Polar Perspectives: Evaluating 2-D LiDAR Projections for Robust Place Recognition with Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02897v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a systematic investigation into how alternative LiDAR-to-image projections affect metric place recognition when coupled with a state-of-the-art vision foundation model. We introduce a modular retrieval pipeline that controls for backbone, aggregation, and evaluation protocol, thereby isolating the influence of the 2-D projection itself. Using consistent geometric and structural channels across multiple datasets and deployment scenarios, we identify the projection characteristics that most strongly determine discriminative power, robustness to environmental variation, and suitability for real-time autonomy. Experiments with different datasets, including integration into an operational place recognition policy, validate the practical relevance of these findings and demonstrate that carefully designed projections can serve as an effective surrogate for end-to-end 3-D learning in LiDAR place recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, 5 Figures, 2 Tables Under Review</p></details> |
