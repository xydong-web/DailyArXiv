| **[3D-GSRD: 3D Molecular Graph Auto-Encoder with Selective Re-mask Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16780v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked graph modeling (MGM) is a promising approach for molecular representation learning (MRL).However, extending the success of re-mask decoding from 2D to 3D MGM is non-trivial, primarily due to two conflicting challenges: avoiding 2D structure leakage to the decoder, while still providing sufficient 2D context for reconstructing re-masked atoms. To address these challenges, we propose 3D-GSRD: a 3D Molecular Graph Auto-Encoder with Selective Re-mask Decoding. The core innovation of 3D-GSRD lies in its Selective Re-mask Decoding(SRD), which re-masks only 3D-relevant information from encoder representations while preserving the 2D graph structures. This SRD is synergistically integrated with a 3D Relational-Transformer(3D-ReTrans) encoder alongside a structure-independent decoder. We analyze that SRD, combined with the structure-independent decoder, enhances the encoder's role in MRL. Extensive experiments show that 3D-GSRD achieves strong downstream performance, setting a new state-of-the-art on 7 out of 8 targets in the widely used MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark. The code is released at https://github.com/WuChang0124/3D-GSRD.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality, multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818 interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories, consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The dataset and source code of PRING are available at https://github.com/SophieSarceau/PRING.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in stabilizing mammalian olfactory receptors and integrating them into biophotonic and bioelectronic systems have enabled detection at near single-molecule resolution thus placing machines on par with trained detection dogs. As this technology converges with multimodal AI and distributed sensor networks imbued with embedded AI, it introduces a new, biochemical layer to a sensing ecosystem currently dominated by machine vision and audition. This review and industry roadmap surveys the scientific foundations, technological frontiers, and strategic applications of machine olfaction making the case that we are currently witnessing the rise of a new industry that brings with it a global chemosensory infrastructure. We cover exemplary industrial, military and consumer applications and address some of the ethical and legal concerns arising. We find that machine olfaction is poised to bring forth a planet-wide molecular awareness tech layer with the potential of spawning vast emerging markets in health, security, and environmental sensing via scent.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 116 citations, combination tech review/industry roadmap/white paper on the rise of machine olfaction as an essential AI modality</p></details> |
| **[Insights into the Unknown: Federated Data Diversity Analysis on Molecular Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19535v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However, their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training across data silos. This federated data access complicates important data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for federated diversity analysis on molecular data.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-order Equivariant Flow Matching for Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18817v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Density functional theory (DFT) is a fundamental method for simulating quantum chemical properties, but it remains expensive due to the iterative self-consistent field (SCF) process required to solve the Kohn-Sham equations. Recently, deep learning methods are gaining attention as a way to bypass this step by directly predicting the Hamiltonian. However, they rely on deterministic regression and do not consider the highly structured nature of Hamiltonians. In this work, we propose QHFlow, a high-order equivariant flow matching framework that generates Hamiltonian matrices conditioned on molecular geometry. Flow matching models continuous-time trajectories between simple priors and complex targets, learning the structured distributions over Hamiltonians instead of direct regression. To further incorporate symmetry, we use a neural architecture that predicts SE(3)-equivariant vector fields, improving accuracy and generalization across diverse geometries. To further enhance physical fidelity, we additionally introduce a fine-tuning scheme to align predicted orbital energies with the target. QHFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing Hamiltonian error by 71% on MD17 and 53% on QH9. Moreover, we further show that QHFlow accelerates the DFT process without trading off the solution quality when initializing SCF iterations with the predicted Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the number of iterations and runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |

| **[HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF): Diffusion-Guided Hypernetworks for Learning Implicit Molecular Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18122v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF), a framework that models 3D molecular conformers as continuous fields rather than discrete atomic coordinates or graphs. At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional Field (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of the nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using molecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields (MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we adopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule, generates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with generative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion model, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design naturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support structure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by selectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and continuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for molecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or point cloud based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach scales to larger biomolecules, illustrating a promising direction for field-based molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Atom-anchored LLMs speak Chemistry: A Retrosynthesis Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16590v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applications of machine learning in chemistry are often limited by the scarcity and expense of labeled data, restricting traditional supervised methods. In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed. Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically plausible reaction sites ($\geq90\%$), named reaction classes ($\geq40\%$), and final reactants ($\geq74\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing data scarcity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Alan ...</summary><p>Alan Kai Hassen and Andrius Bernatavicius contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[Copy-Augmented Representation for Structure Invariant Template-Free Retrosynthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16588v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrosynthesis prediction is fundamental to drug discovery and chemical synthesis, requiring the identification of reactants that can produce a target molecule. Current template-free methods struggle to capture the structural invariance inherent in chemical reactions, where substantial molecular scaffolds remain unchanged, leading to unnecessarily large search spaces and reduced prediction accuracy. We introduce C-SMILES, a novel molecular representation that decomposes traditional SMILES into element-token pairs with five special tokens, effectively minimizing editing distance between reactants and products. Building upon this representation, we incorporate a copy-augmented mechanism that dynamically determines whether to generate new tokens or preserve unchanged molecular fragments from the product. Our approach integrates SMILES alignment guidance to enhance attention consistency with ground-truth atom mappings, enabling more chemically coherent predictions. Comprehensive evaluation on USPTO-50K and large-scale USPTO-FULL datasets demonstrates significant improvements: 67.2% top-1 accuracy on USPTO-50K and 50.8% on USPTO-FULL, with 99.9% validity in generated molecules. This work establishes a new paradigm for structure-aware molecular generation with direct applications in computational drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rao-Blackwell Gradient Estimators for Equivariant Denoising Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09890v4)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In domains such as molecular and protein generation, physical systems exhibit inherent symmetries that are critical to model. Two main strategies have emerged for learning invariant distributions: designing equivariant network architectures and using data augmentation to approximate equivariance. While equivariant architectures preserve symmetry by design, they often involve greater complexity and pose optimization challenges. Data augmentation, on the other hand, offers flexibility but may fall short in fully capturing symmetries. Our framework enhances both approaches by reducing training variance and providing a provably lower-variance gradient estimator. We achieve this by interpreting data augmentation as a Monte Carlo estimator of the training gradient and applying Rao-Blackwellization. This leads to more stable optimization, faster convergence, and reduced variance, all while requiring only a single forward and backward pass per sample. We also present a practical implementation of this estimator incorporating the loss and sampling procedure through a method we call Orbit Diffusion. Theoretically, we guarantee that our loss admits equivariant minimizers. Empirically, Orbit Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art results on GEOM-QM9 for molecular conformation generation, improves crystal structure prediction, and advances text-guided crystal generation on the Perov-5 and MP-20 benchmarks. Additionally, it enhances protein designability in protein structure generation. Code is available at: https://github.com/vinhsuhi/Orbit-Diffusion.git.</p></details> |  |

Within molecular design for pharmaceutical development, these models can propose innovative molecular modifications but frequently generate chemically infeasible structures. We introduce VALID-Mol, a comprehensive framework that integrates chemical validation with LLM-driven molecular design, achieving an improvement in valid chemical structure generation from 3% to 83%. Our methodology synthesizes systematic prompt optimization, automated chemical verification, and domain-adapted fine-tuning to ensure dependable generation of synthesizable molecules with enhanced properties. Our contribution extends beyond implementation details to provide a transferable methodology for scientifically-constrained LLM applications with measurable reliability enhancements. Computational analyses indicate our framework generates promising synthesis candidates with up to 17-fold predicted improvements in target binding affinity while preserving synthetic feasibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, 1 algorithm, 5 tables, to be published in ISPACS 2025, unabridged version exists as arXiv:2506.23339v1</p></details> |
| **[Superior Molecular Representations from Intermediate Encoder Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06443v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation. However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we first analyze the information flow in five diverse molecular encoders and find that intermediate layers retain more general-purpose features, whereas the final-layer specializes and compresses information. We then perform an empirical layer-wise evaluation across 22 property prediction tasks. We find that using frozen embeddings from optimal intermediate layers improves downstream performance by an average of 5.4%, up to 28.6%, compared to the final-layer. Furthermore, finetuning encoders truncated at intermediate depths achieves even greater average improvements of 8.5%, with increases as high as 40.8%, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unified and Lossless Latent Space for 3D Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15567v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality. On GEOM-Drugs, it reduces FCD by 72.6\% over the previous best result, while achieving over 70\% relative average improvements in geometric fidelity. Our code is released at https://github.com/lyc0930/UAE-3D/.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Controllable Graph Generation with Diffusion Models via Inference-Time Tree Search Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10402v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation. TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition, reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods plateau early under limited resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Bayesian Flow Networks for Molecular Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10211v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently, prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmenting generative models with biomedical knowledge graphs improves targeted drug discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09914v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model), a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical therapeutic development.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence, October 2025</p></details> |
| **[MolSpectLLM: A Molecular Foundation Model Bridging Spectroscopy, Molecule Elucidation, and 3D Structure Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21861v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction. Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks. MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task, obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular elucidation, and molecular design. Code are available at \href{https://github.com/Eurekashen/MolSpectLLM}{https://github.com/Eurekashen/MolSpectLLM}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Agent for Modular Task Execution in Drug Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02925v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved relevant biomolecular information, including FASTA sequences, SMILES representations, and literature, and answered mechanistic questions with improved contextual accuracy compared to standard LLMs. It then generated chemically diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55. The number of molecules satisfying empirical drug-likeness filters also rose; for example, compliance with the Ghose filter increased from 32 to 55 within a pool of 100 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models, providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.</p></details> |  |

| **[Diffusion-Based Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Simulating Nonlinear Solid Mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06045v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations usually occurring in solid mechanics, and suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network (ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i) Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference (ROBI), a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities. ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[gLSTM: Mitigating Over-Squashing by Increasing Storage Capacity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08450v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism. While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity. Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 22 figures, 7 tables. v2: clarified over-squashing separation in light of related work</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Boltzmann Generators for equilibrium sampling of large-scale materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25486v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of generative models to sample equilibrium distributions of many-body systems, as first demonstrated by Boltzmann Generators, has attracted substantial interest due to their ability to produce unbiased and uncorrelated samples in `one shot'. Despite their promise and impressive results across the natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural networks to base the generation process on local environmental information, while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies. Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where finite-size effects become negligible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Survey of Graph Neural Network for Internet of Things and NextG Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17309v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential increase in Internet of Things (IoT) devices coupled with 6G pushing towards higher data rates and connected devices has sparked a surge in data. Consequently, harnessing the full potential of data-driven machine learning has become one of the important thrusts. In addition to the advancement in wireless technology, it is important to efficiently use the resources available and meet the users' requirements. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for effectively modeling and extracting insights which inherently exhibit complex network structures due to its high performance and accuracy, scalability, adaptability, and resource efficiency. There is a lack of a comprehensive survey that focuses on the applications and advances GNN has made in the context of IoT and Next Generation (NextG) networks. To bridge that gap, this survey starts by providing a detailed description of GNN's terminologies, architecture, and the different types of GNNs. Then we provide a comprehensive survey of the advancements in applying GNNs for IoT from the perspective of data fusion and intrusion detection. Thereafter, we survey the impact GNN has made in improving spectrum awareness. Next, we provide a detailed account of how GNN has been leveraged for networking and tactical systems.

| **[EEG-Based Consumer Behaviour Prediction: An Exploration from Classical Machine Learning to Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21567v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Benchmark for RNA 3D Structure-Function Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21681v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The relationship between RNA structure and function has recently attracted interest within the deep learning community, a trend expected to intensify as nucleic acid structure models advance. Despite this momentum, the lack of standardized, accessible benchmarks for applying deep learning to RNA 3D structures hinders progress. To this end, we introduce a collection of seven benchmarking datasets specifically designed to support RNA structure-function prediction. Built on top of the established Python package rnaglib, our library streamlines data distribution and encoding, provides tools for dataset splitting and evaluation, and offers a comprehensive, user-friendly environment for model comparison. The modular and reproducible design of our datasets encourages community contributions and enables rapid customization. To demonstrate the utility of our benchmarks, we report baseline results for all tasks using a relational graph neural network.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches mainly target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting, (ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities without sacrificing performance. Code is available at https://github.com/sybeam27/FnRGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Graph Neural Networks: A Mutual Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19223v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mesh Interpolation Graph Network for Dynamic and Spatially Irregular Global Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20911v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have shown promising results in weather forecasting, which is critical for human activity such as agriculture planning and extreme weather preparation. However, most studies focus on finite and local areas for training, overlooking the influence of broader areas and limiting their ability to generalize effectively. Thus, in this work, we study global weather forecasting that is irregularly distributed and dynamically varying in practice, requiring the model to generalize to unobserved locations. To address such challenges, we propose a general Mesh Interpolation Graph Network (MIGN) that models the irregular weather station forecasting, consisting of two key designs: (1) learning spatially irregular data with regular mesh interpolation network to align the data; (2) leveraging parametric spherical harmonics location embedding to further enhance spatial generalization ability. Extensive experiments on an up-to-date observation dataset show that MIGN significantly outperforms existing data-driven models. Besides, we show that MIGN has spatial generalization ability, and is capable of generalizing to previous unseen stations.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 main track</p></details> |
| **[An Active Diffusion Neural Network for Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19202v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node distinctiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning noisy tissue dynamics across time scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19090v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tissue dynamics play a crucial role in biological processes ranging from wound healing to morphogenesis. However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are notoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks, normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph. This machine learning architecture reflects the architecture of the underlying biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed to train it compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

These graphs provide a hierarchical metric-semantic representation in which such concepts are organized. To further enhance graph-SLAM performance, Factorized 3D Scene Graphs incorporate these concepts as optimization factors that constrain relative geometry and enforce global consistency. However, both stages of this process remain largely manual: concepts are typically derived using hand-crafted, concept-specific heuristics, while factors and their covariances are likewise manually designed. This reliance on manual specification limits generalization across diverse environments and scalability to new concept classes. This paper presents, for the first time, a learning-based method to generate online spatial emergent concepts as optimizable factors within a SLAM backend, reducing the need to handcraft both concept generation and the definition of their corresponding factors and covariances. In both simulated and real indoor scenarios, our approach improves complex concept detection by 20.7% and 5.3%, trajectory estimation by 19.2%, and map reconstruction by 12.3% and 3.8%, respectively, highlighting the benefits of this integration for robust and adaptive spatial understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers, which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molecular Fingerprints Are Strong Models for Peptide Function Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17901v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding peptide properties is often assumed to require modeling long-range molecular interactions, motivating the use of complex graph neural networks and pretrained transformers. Yet, whether such long-range dependencies are essential remains unclear. We investigate if simple, domain-specific molecular fingerprints can capture peptide function without these assumptions. Atomic-level representation aims to provide richer information than purely sequence-based models and better efficiency than structural ones. Across 132 datasets, including LRGB and five other peptide benchmarks, models using count-based ECFP, Topological Torsion, and RDKit fingerprints with LightGBM achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. Despite encoding only short-range molecular features, these models outperform GNNs and transformer-based approaches. Control experiments with sequence shuffling and amino acid counts confirm that fingerprints, though inherently local, suffice for robust peptide property prediction. Our results challenge the presumed necessity of long-range interaction modeling and highlight molecular fingerprints as efficient, interpretable, and computationally lightweight alternatives for peptide prediction.</p></details> |  |

Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii) the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18467v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) are ubiquitous data structures in the real world. Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes, existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm, which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network (SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurips 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple, explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating 20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization, hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data.

Moreover, the complex and diverse local topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge. Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD) framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs. Our code is available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

| **[Graph Representation Learning with Diffusion Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13133v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have established themselves as state-of-the-art generative models across various data modalities, including images and videos, due to their ability to accurately approximate complex data distributions. Unlike traditional generative approaches such as VAEs and GANs, diffusion models employ a progressive denoising process that transforms noise into meaningful data over multiple iterative steps. This gradual approach enhances their expressiveness and generation quality. Not only that, diffusion models have also been shown to extract meaningful representations from data while learning to generate samples. Despite their success, the application of diffusion models to graph-structured data remains relatively unexplored, primarily due to the discrete nature of graphs, which necessitates discrete diffusion processes distinct from the continuous methods used in other domains. In this work, we leverage the representational capabilities of diffusion models to learn meaningful embeddings for graph data. By training a discrete diffusion model within an autoencoder framework, we enable both effective autoencoding and representation learning tailored to the unique characteristics of graph-structured data. We extract the representation from the combination of the encoder's output and the decoder's first time step hidden embedding. Our approach demonstrates the potential of discrete diffusion models to be used for graph representation learning.

In this paper, we demonstrate that this expressiveness introduces a vulnerability: advanced speech enhancement models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we show that adversarial noise, carefully crafted and psychoacoustically masked by the original input, can be injected such that the enhanced speech output conveys an entirely different semantic meaning. We experimentally verify that contemporary predictive speech enhancement models can indeed be manipulated in this way. Furthermore, we highlight that diffusion models with stochastic samplers exhibit inherent robustness to such adversarial attacks by design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2026 IEEE.

OmniMotion-X efficiently supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance, speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis), as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps. To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions, capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic, coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Simulating Nonlinear Solid Mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06045v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations usually occurring in solid mechanics, and suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network (ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i) Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference (ROBI), a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities. ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Free Constrained Generation With Stable Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05625v4)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stable diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art in data synthesis across diverse domains and hold transformative potential for applications in science and engineering, e.g., by facilitating the discovery of novel solutions and simulating systems that are computationally intractable to model explicitly. While there is increasing effort to incorporate physics-based constraints into generative models, existing techniques are either limited in their applicability to latent diffusion frameworks or lack the capability to strictly enforce domain-specific constraints. To address this limitation this paper proposes a novel integration of stable diffusion models with constrained optimization frameworks, enabling the generation of outputs satisfying stringent physical and functional requirements. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through material design experiments requiring adherence to precise morphometric properties, challenging inverse design tasks involving the generation of materials inducing specific stress-strain responses, and copyright-constrained content generation tasks.

| **[A Survey on Cache Methods in Diffusion Models: Toward Efficient Multi-Modal Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19755v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent \textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation. Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its classification and analysis. Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of \textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.</p></details> | 22 pages,2 figures |

This study investigates the cultural dimensions of AI adoption and their influence on cognitive strategies across nine national contexts in Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America. Drawing on survey data from a diverse pilot sample (n = 21) and guided by cross-cultural psychology, digital ethics, and sociotechnical systems theory, we examine how demographic variables (age, gender, professional role) and cultural orientations (language, values, and institutional exposure) mediate perceptions of trust, ethical acceptability, and reliance on AI. Results reveal two key findings: First, cultural factors, particularly language and age, significantly affect AI adoption and perceptions of reliability with older participants reporting higher engagement with AI for educational purposes. Second, ethical judgment about AI use varied across domains, with professional contexts normalizing its role as a pragmatic collaborator while academic settings emphasized risks of plagiarism. These findings extend prior research on culture and technology adoption by demonstrating that AI use is neither universal nor neutral but culturally contingent, domain-specific, and ethically situated. The study highlights implications for AI use in education, professional practice, and global technology policy, pointing at actions that enable usage of AI in a way that is both culturally adaptive and ethically robust.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Masked and Unmasked: Discrete Diffusion Models via Partial Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18495v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDM) are powerful generative models for discrete data that generate samples by progressively unmasking tokens in a sequence. Each token can take one of two states: masked or unmasked. We observe that token sequences often remain unchanged between consecutive sampling steps; consequently, the model repeatedly processes identical inputs, leading to redundant computation. To address this inefficiency, we propose the Partial masking scheme (Prime), which augments MDM by allowing tokens to take intermediate states interpolated between the masked and unmasked states. This design enables the model to make predictions based on partially observed token information, and facilitates a fine-grained denoising process. We derive a variational training objective and introduce a simple architectural design to accommodate intermediate-state inputs. Our method demonstrates superior performance across a diverse set of generative modeling tasks. On text data, it achieves a perplexity of 15.36 on OpenWebText, outperforming previous MDM (21.52), autoregressive models (17.54), and their hybrid variants (17.58), without relying on an autoregressive formulation. On image data, it attains competitive FID scores of 3.26 on CIFAR-10 and 6.98 on ImageNet-32, comparable to leading continuous generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2025.

Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff, HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties. We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32 intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical, privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uni-Instruct: One-step Diffusion Model through Unified Diffusion Divergence Instruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20755v4)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, $f$-distill, etc, inside a theory-driven framework which we name the \textbf{\emph{Uni-Instruct}}. Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the $f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35). We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

This requires decomposing mutual information into contributions from individual stimuli and stimulus features: a fundamentally ill-posed problem with infinitely many possible solutions. We address this by introducing three core axioms, additivity, positivity, and locality that any meaningful stimulus-wise decomposition should satisfy. We then derive a decomposition that meets all three criteria and remains tractable for high-dimensional stimuli. Our decomposition can be efficiently estimated using diffusion models, allowing for scaling up to complex, structured and naturalistic stimuli. Applied to a model of visual neurons, our method quantifies how specific stimuli and features contribute to encoded information. Our approach provides a scalable, interpretable tool for probing representations in both biological and artificial neural systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Steev...</summary><p>Steeve Laquitaine and Simone Azeglio have equal contributions; Ulisse Ferrari and Matthew Chalk have equal senior contributions</p></details> |

Short-term precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT, a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block) method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step. Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI (Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet) models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x faster than comparable baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[dInfer: An Efficient Inference Framework for Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08666v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference pipeline into four modular components--model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager--and integrates novel algorithms for each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800 tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to prior systems, dInfer delivers a $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while maintaining similar model performance. Even compared to the AR model (with a comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which is highly optimized with the latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still delivers a $2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network Contagion Dynamics in European Banking: A Navier-Stokes Framework for Systemic Risk Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19630v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a continuous functional framework for analyzing contagion dynamics in financial networks, extending the Navier-Stokes-based approach to network-structured spatial processes. We model financial distress propagation as a diffusion process on weighted networks, deriving a network diffusion equation from first principles that predicts contagion decay depends on the network's algebraic connectivity through the relation $\kappa = \sqrt{\lambda_2/D}$, where $\lambda_2$ is the second-smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Applying this framework to European banking data from the EBA stress tests (2018, 2021, 2023), we estimate interbank exposure networks using maximum entropy methods and track the evolution of systemic risk through the COVID-19 crisis. Our key finding is that network connectivity declined by 45\% from 2018 to 2023, implying a 26\% reduction in the contagion decay parameter. Difference-in-differences analysis reveals this structural change was driven by regulatory-induced deleveraging of systemically important banks, which experienced differential asset reductions of 17\% relative to smaller institutions. The networks exhibit lognormal rather than scale-free degree distributions, suggesting greater resilience than previously assumed in the literature. Extensive robustness checks across parametric and non-parametric estimation methods confirm declining systemic risk, with cross-method correlations exceeding 0.95. These findings demonstrate that post-COVID-19 regulatory reforms effectively reduced network interconnectedness and systemic vulnerability in the European banking system.</p></details> | <details><summary>107 p...</summary><p>107 pages, 14 figures</p></details> |

However, traditional evacuation simulation relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6% improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster, thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pragmatic Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception via Generative Communication Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19618v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications, differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2) accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model, generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 figures, accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We theoretically show in finite samples that depending on the permitted sampling information, the RV estimator is most efficient under either hitting time sampling that samples whenever the price changes by a pre-determined threshold, or under the new concept of realized business time that samples according to a combination of observed trades and estimated tick variance. The analysis builds on the assumption that asset prices follow a diffusion that is time-changed with a jump process that separately models the transaction times. This provides a flexible model that allows for leverage specifications and Hawkes-type jump processes and separately captures the empirically varying trading intensity and tick variance processes, which are particularly relevant for disentangling the driving forces of the sampling schemes. Extensive simulations confirm our theoretical results and show that for low levels of noise, hitting time sampling remains superior while for increasing noise levels, realized business time becomes the empirically most efficient sampling scheme. An application to stock data provides empirical evidence for the benefits of using these intrinsic sampling schemes to construct more efficient RV estimators as well as for an improved forecast performance.</p></details> |  |

However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial, temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames), and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement, and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving consistent improvements on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically incorporate auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However, since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics, thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios) demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy (e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark), with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.</p></details> | 24 pages, 14 figures |

This is a nontrivial extension of the TPD method [Chen et al. (2025) SIAM J. Sci. Comput.] incorporating proximal splitting techniques to address the challenges arising from the nonsmoothness of the objective function. Our key contributions include: (i) a semi-implicit-explicit iterative scheme that combines proximal gradient steps with explicit gradient steps to treat the nonsmooth and smooth terms respectively; (ii) variable-dependent preconditioners constructed from the Hessian of a regularized objective to balance iteration count and per-iteration cost; (iii) a proof of existence and uniqueness of bounded solutions for the generalized proximal operator with the chosen preconditioner, along with a convergent and bound-preserving Newton solver; and (iv) an adaptive step-size strategy to improve robustness and accelerate convergence under poor Lipschitz conditions of the energy derivative. Comprehensive numerical experiments spanning from 1D to 3D settings demonstrate that our method achieves superior computational efficiency-achieving up to a 20$\times$ speedup over existing methods-thereby highlighting its broad applicability through several challenging simulations.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

However, complex disaster scenes with diverse disaster types, geographic regions, and satellite sensors have posed new challenges for VLM applications. To fill this gap, we curate a remote sensing vision-language dataset (DisasterM3) for global-scale disaster assessment and response. DisasterM3 includes 26,988 bi-temporal satellite images and 123k instruction pairs across 5 continents, with three characteristics: 1) Multi-hazard: DisasterM3 involves 36 historical disaster events with significant impacts, which are categorized into 10 common natural and man-made disasters. 2)Multi-sensor: Extreme weather during disasters often hinders optical sensor imaging, making it necessary to combine Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for post-disaster scenes. 3) Multi-task: Based on real-world scenarios, DisasterM3 includes 9 disaster-related visual perception and reasoning tasks, harnessing the full potential of VLM's reasoning ability with progressing from disaster-bearing body recognition to structural damage assessment and object relational reasoning, culminating in the generation of long-form disaster reports. We extensively evaluated 14 generic and remote sensing VLMs on our benchmark, revealing that state-of-the-art models struggle with the disaster tasks, largely due to the lack of a disaster-specific corpus, cross-sensor gap, and damage object counting insensitivity. Focusing on these issues, we fine-tune four VLMs using our dataset and achieve stable improvements across all tasks, with robust cross-sensor and cross-disaster generalization capabilities. The code and data are available at: https://github.com/Junjue-Wang/DisasterM3.</p></details> | <details><summary>A mul...</summary><p>A multi-hazard, multi-sensor, and multi-task vision-language dataset for global-scale disaster assessment and response</p></details> |

Existing models often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of 73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted at ICCV Conference 2025</p></details> |

However, existing open-vocabulary and visual grounding methods rely on explicit category cues, limiting their ability to handle complex or implicit queries that require advanced reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce a new suite of tasks, including Instruction-Oriented Object Counting, Detection, and Segmentation (InstructCDS), covering open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass scenarios. We further present EarthInstruct, the first InstructCDS benchmark for earth observation. It is constructed from two diverse remote sensing datasets with varying spatial resolutions and annotation rules across 20 categories, necessitating models to interpret dataset-specific instructions. Given the scarcity of semantically rich labeled data in remote sensing, we propose InstructSAM, a training-free framework for instruction-driven object recognition. InstructSAM leverages large vision-language models to interpret user instructions and estimate object counts, employs SAM2 for mask proposal, and formulates mask-label assignment as a binary integer programming problem. By integrating semantic similarity with counting constraints, InstructSAM efficiently assigns categories to predicted masks without relying on confidence thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that InstructSAM matches or surpasses specialized baselines across multiple tasks while maintaining near-constant inference time regardless of object count, reducing output tokens by 89% and overall runtime by over 32% compared to direct generation approaches. We believe the contributions of the proposed tasks, benchmark, and effective approach will advance future research in developing versatile object recognition systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While many text-to-image models prioritize aesthetics over accessibility, it is not clear how visual illustrations relate to text simplifications (TS) generated from them. This paper presents a structured vision-language model (VLM) prompting framework for generating accessible images from simplified texts. We designed five prompt templates, i.e., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, Educational Layout, Multi-Level Detail, and Grid Layout, each following distinct spatial arrangements while adhering to accessibility constraints such as object count limits, spatial separation, and content restrictions. Using 400 sentence-level simplifications from four established TS datasets (OneStopEnglish, SimPA, Wikipedia, and ASSET), we conducted a two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assessed prompt template effectiveness with CLIPScores, and Phase 2 involved human annotation of generated images across ten visual styles by four accessibility experts. Results show that the Basic Object Focus prompt template achieved the highest semantic alignment, indicating that visual minimalism enhances language accessibility. Expert evaluation further identified Retro style as the most accessible and Wikipedia as the most effective data source. Inter-annotator agreement varied across dimensions, with Text Simplicity showing strong reliability and Image Quality proving more subjective. Overall, our framework offers practical guidelines for accessible content generation and underscores the importance of structured prompting in AI-generated visual accessibility tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Numerosity in Diffusion Models -- Limitations and Remedies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11117v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6 featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization across settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Head-wise Adaptive Rotary Positional Encoding for Fine-Grained Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10489v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data. While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation, axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image generative models.</p></details> |  |

A persistent challenge, however, is disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational circuits.</p></details> |  |

This widespread deep-layer bias, however, is largely driven by empirical convention rather than principled analysis. While prior studies suggest that different ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, the impact of this variation on MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present the first comprehensive study of visual layer selection for MLLMs, analyzing representation similarity across ViT layers to establish shallow, middle, and deep layer groupings. Through extensive evaluation of MLLMs (1.4B-7B parameters) across 10 benchmarks encompassing 60+ tasks, we find that while deep layers excel in semantic-rich tasks like OCR, shallow and middle layers significantly outperform them on fine-grained visual tasks including counting, positioning, and object localization. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight feature fusion method that strategically incorporates shallower layers, achieving consistent improvements over both single-layer and specialized fusion baselines. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, showing that MLLMs can often see better when they look shallower.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, accepted by EMNLP2025</p></details> |
| **[Visual Representation Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07979v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning. We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/VIRAL/</p></details> |

However, multi-object scenes remain challenging, as reliable control over object categories, counts, and spatial layout is difficult to achieve. For that, we first study quantity and layout consistent image editing, abbreviated as QL-Edit, which targets control of object quantity and spatial layout in multi-object scenes. Then, we present IMAGHarmony, a straightforward framework featuring a plug-and-play harmony aware (HA) module that fuses perception semantics while modeling object counts and locations, resulting in accurate edits and strong structural consistency. We further observe that diffusion models are sensitive to the choice of initial noise and tend to prefer certain noise patterns. Based on this finding, we present a preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that selects semantically aligned initial noise through vision and language matching, thereby further improving generation stability and layout consistency in multiple object editing. To support evaluation, we develop HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers a diverse range of quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGHarmony outperforms prior methods in both structural alignment and semantic accuracy, utilizing only 200 training images and 10.6M of trainable parameters.

Mainstream Object-Centric Learning (OCL) methods adopt Slot Attention or its variants to iteratively aggregate objects' super-pixels into a fixed set of query feature vectors, termed slots. However, their reliance on a static slot count leads to an object being represented as multiple parts when the number of objects varies. We introduce MetaSlot, a plug-and-play Slot Attention variant that adapts to variable object counts. MetaSlot (i) maintains a codebook that holds prototypes of objects in a dataset by vector-quantizing the resulting slot representations; (ii) removes duplicate slots from the traditionally aggregated slots by quantizing them with the codebook; and (iii) injects progressively weaker noise into the Slot Attention iterations to accelerate and stabilize the aggregation. MetaSlot is a general Slot Attention variant that can be seamlessly integrated into existing OCL architectures. Across multiple public datasets and tasks--including object discovery and recognition--models equipped with MetaSlot achieve significant performance gains and markedly interpretable slot representations, compared with existing Slot Attention variants.</p></details> |  |

Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear, consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts; reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack: incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design, rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate computation with respect to complexity.</p></details> |  |

These models have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark, VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation. Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the \textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach for reducing it.</p></details> |  |

We propose a multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11 underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains, demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset, highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable ecological insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+1 p...</summary><p>8+1 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Previously, this task was dominated by class-specific methods, which have gradually evolved into more adaptable class-agnostic strategies. However, these strategies come with their own set of limitations, such as the need for manual exemplar input and multiple passes for multiple categories, resulting in significant inefficiencies. This paper introduces a more practical approach enabling simultaneous counting of multiple object categories using an open-vocabulary framework. Our solution, OmniCount, stands out by using semantic and geometric insights (priors) from pre-trained models to count multiple categories of objects as specified by users, all without additional training. OmniCount distinguishes itself by generating precise object masks and leveraging varied interactive prompts via the Segment Anything Model for efficient counting. To evaluate OmniCount, we created the OmniCount-191 benchmark, a first-of-its-kind dataset with multi-label object counts, including points, bounding boxes, and VQA annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation in OmniCount-191, alongside other leading benchmarks, demonstrates OmniCount's exceptional performance, significantly outpacing existing solutions.

On the other hand, beam search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to also be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its derivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The results show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST tasks that require high accuracy.

Encoder-decoder architectures have become the widely used approach for RSIC by translating visual content into descriptive text. However, many existing methods rely on a single-stream architecture, which weakens the model to accurately describe the image. Such single-stream architectures typically struggle to extract diverse spatial features or capture complex semantic relationships, limiting their effectiveness in scenes with high intraclass similarity or contextual ambiguity. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-stream Encoder-decoder Framework (MsEdF) which improves the performance of RSIC by optimizing both the spatial representation and language generation of encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder fuses information from two complementary image encoders, thereby promoting feature diversity through the integration of multiscale and structurally distinct cues. To improve the capture of context-aware descriptions, we refine the input sequence's semantic modeling on the decoder side using a stacked GRU architecture with an element-wise aggregation scheme. Experiments on three benchmark RSIC datasets show that MsEdF outperforms several baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Single Models: Mitigating Multimodal Hallucinations via Adaptive Token Ensemble Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18321v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference. ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM robustness in high-stakes applications.

| **[Visionary-R1: Mitigating Shortcuts in Visual Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14677v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning general-purpose reasoning capabilities has long been a challenging problem in AI. Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can enable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple question-answer pairs. In this paper, we aim to train visual language models (VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and visual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning to a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before providing an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy questions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data distributions. We argue that the key to mitigating shortcut learning is to encourage the model to interpret images prior to reasoning. Therefore, we train the model to adhere to a caption-reason-answer output format: initially generating a detailed caption for an image, followed by constructing an extensive reasoning chain. When trained on 273K CoT-free visual question-answer pairs and using only reinforcement learning, our model, named Visionary-R1, outperforms strong multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Underwater imagery presents unique challenges including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding. UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including 15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks: detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms, and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration. Our code and benchmark will be available.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have released V1, which only reports the test results.

To address this, we present AfriCaption, a comprehensive framework for multilingual image captioning in 20 African languages and our contributions are threefold: (i) a curated dataset built on Flickr8k, featuring semantically aligned captions generated via a context-aware selection and translation process; (ii) a dynamic, context-preserving pipeline that ensures ongoing quality through model ensembling and adaptive substitution; and (iii) the AfriCaption model, a 0.5B parameter vision-to-text architecture that integrates SigLIP and NLLB200 for caption generation across under-represented languages. This unified framework ensures ongoing data quality and establishes the first scalable image-captioning resource for under-represented African languages, laying the groundwork for truly inclusive multimodal AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Universal Are SAM2 Features?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17051v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The trade-off between general-purpose foundation vision models and their specialized counterparts is critical for efficient feature coding design and is not yet fully understood. We investigate this trade-off by comparing the feature versatility of the general-purpose Hiera encoder against the segmentation-specialized Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). Using a lightweight, trainable neck to probe the adaptability of their frozen features, we quantify the information-theoretic cost of specialization. Our results reveal that while SAM2's specialization is highly effective for spatially-related tasks like depth estimation, it comes at a cost. The specialized SAM2 encoder underperforms its generalist predecessor, Hiera, on conceptually distant tasks such as pose estimation and image captioning, demonstrating a measurable loss of broader semantic information. A novel cross-neck analysis on SAM2 reveals that each level of adaptation creates a further representational bottleneck. Our analysis illuminates these trade-offs in feature universality, providing a quantitative foundation for designing efficient feature coding and adaptation strategies for diverse downstream applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in IEEE Picture Coding Symposium (PCS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Graph4MM: Weaving Multimodal Learning with Structural Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16990v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multimodal data usually exhibit complex structural relationships beyond traditional one-to-one mappings like image-caption pairs. Entities across modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming diverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references. Graphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and inter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish multi-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which fragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key challenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from multi-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific information in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the role of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and propose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific, we introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural information into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion. Furthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for cross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that leveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions improves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone modality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that Graph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines, achieving a 6.93% average improvement.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Dual Caption Preference Optimization for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06023v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in human preference optimization, originally developed for Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown significant potential in improving text-to-image diffusion models. These methods aim to learn the distribution of preferred samples while distinguishing them from less preferred ones. However, within the existing preference datasets, the original caption often does not clearly favor the preferred image over the alternative, which weakens the supervision signal available during training. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Caption Preference Optimization (DCPO), a data augmentation and optimization framework that reinforces the learning signal by assigning two distinct captions to each preference pair. This encourages the model to better differentiate between preferred and less-preferred outcomes during training. We also construct Pick-Double Caption, a modified version of Pick-a-Pic v2 with separate captions for each image, and propose three different strategies for generating distinct captions: captioning, perturbation, and hybrid methods. Our experiments show that DCPO significantly improves image quality and relevance to prompts, outperforming Stable Diffusion (SD) 2.1, SFT_Chosen, Diffusion-DPO, and MaPO across multiple metrics, including Pickscore, HPSv2.1, GenEval, CLIPscore, and ImageReward, fine-tuned on SD 2.1 as the backbone.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose leveraging Singular-Value Decomposition (SVD) over the joint query (Q), key (K), and value (V) weight matrices to reduce KV cache size and computational overhead. We in addition introduce an efficient rank allocation strategy that dynamically adjusts the SVD rank based on its impact on VLM accuracy, achieving a significant reduction in both memory usage and computational cost. Finally, we extend this approach by applying quantization to both VLM weights and activations, resulting in a highly efficient VLM. Our method outperforms previous approaches that rely solely on quantization or SVD by achieving more than $10\%$ accuracy improvement while consuming less hardware cost, making it better for real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices.

We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to the community for reproduction and further development.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

In this task, current open-source models present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5% reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and cost-effective visual captioning solution.</p></details> |  |

Falcon offers a unified, prompt-based paradigm that effectively executes comprehensive and complex remote sensing tasks. Falcon demonstrates powerful understanding and reasoning abilities at the image, region, and pixel levels. Specifically, given simple natural language instructions and remote sensing images, Falcon can produce impressive results in text form across 14 distinct tasks, i.e., image classification, object detection, segmentation, image captioning, and etc. To facilitate Falcon's training and empower its representation capacity to encode rich spatial and semantic information, we developed Falcon_SFT, a large-scale, multi-task, instruction-tuning dataset in the field of remote sensing. The Falcon_SFT dataset consists of approximately 78 million high-quality data samples, covering 5.6 million multi-spatial resolution and multi-view remote sensing images with diverse instructions. It features hierarchical annotations and undergoes manual sampling verification to ensure high data quality and reliability. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted, which verify that Falcon achieves remarkable performance over 67 datasets and 14 tasks, despite having only 0.7B parameters. We release the complete dataset, code, and model weights at https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon, hoping to help further develop the open-source community.</p></details> |  |

Despite their classification prowess, these models struggle in dense tasks like zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation. This deficiency is often attributed to the absence of localization cues in captions and the intertwined nature of the learning process, which encompasses both image representation learning and cross-modality alignment. To tackle these issues, we propose SimZSS, a Simple framework for open-vocabulary Zero-Shot Segmentation. The method is founded on two key principles: i) leveraging frozen vision-only models that exhibit spatial awareness while exclusively aligning the text encoder and ii) exploiting the discrete nature of text and linguistic knowledge to pinpoint local concepts within captions. By capitalizing on the quality of the visual representations, our method requires only image-caption pairs datasets and adapts to both small curated and large-scale noisy datasets. When trained on COCO Captions across 8 GPUs, SimZSS achieves state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 8 benchmark datasets in less than 15 minutes.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; Project Page, Code, and Dataset at: https://merit-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

This separation hinders the joint representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing, we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data, particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models (MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral.

Unlike prior approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer actively aligns vision and language representation features during training, enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements, producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PMLR and NeurIPS 2025 UniReps</p></details> |

| **[Unveiling Transformer Perception by Exploring Input Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06019v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a general method for the exploration of equivalence classes in the input space of Transformer models. The proposed approach is based on sound mathematical theory which describes the internal layers of a Transformer architecture as sequential deformations of the input manifold. Using eigendecomposition of the pullback of the distance metric defined on the output space through the Jacobian of the model, we are able to reconstruct equivalence classes in the input space and navigate across them. Our method enables two complementary exploration procedures: the first retrieves input instances that produce the same class probability distribution as the original instance-thus identifying elements within the same equivalence class-while the second discovers instances that yield a different class probability distribution, effectively navigating toward distinct equivalence classes. Finally, we demonstrate how the retrieved instances can be meaningfully interpreted by projecting their embeddings back into a human-readable format.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Approximate Light Spanners in Planar Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24825v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In their seminal paper, Alth\"{o}fer et al. (DCG 1993) introduced the {\em greedy spanner} and showed that, for any weighted planar graph $G$, the weight of the greedy $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner is at most $(1+\frac{2}{\epsilon}) \cdot w(MST(G))$, where $w(MST(G))$ is the weight of a minimum spanning tree $MST(G)$ of $G$. This bound is optimal in an {\em existential sense}: there exist planar graphs $G$ for which any $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner has a weight of at least $(1+\frac{2}{\epsilon}) \cdot w(MST(G))$. However, as an {\em approximation algorithm}, even for a {\em bicriteria} approximation, the weight approximation factor of the greedy spanner is essentially as large as the existential bound: There exist planar graphs $G$ for which the greedy $(1+x \epsilon)$-spanner (for any $1\leq x = O(\epsilon^{-1/2})$) has a weight of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\epsilon \cdot x^2})\cdot w(G_{OPT, \epsilon})$, where $G_{OPT, \epsilon}$ is a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner of $G$ of minimum weight. Despite the flurry of works over the past three decades on approximation algorithms for spanners as well as on light(-weight) spanners, there is still no (possibly bicriteria) approximation algorithm for light spanners in weighted planar graphs that outperforms the existential bound. As our main contribution, we present a polynomial time algorithm for constructing, in any weighted planar graph $G$, a $(1+\epsilon\cdot 2^{O(\log^* 1/\epsilon)})$-spanner for $G$ of total weight $O(1)\cdot w(G_{OPT, \epsilon})$. To achieve this result, we develop a new technique, which we refer to as {\em iterative planar pruning}. It iteratively modifies a spanner [...]</p></details> | <details><summary>SODA ...</summary><p>SODA 2026, abstract shortened to meet arXiv limit</p></details> |
| **[Justitia: Fair and Efficient Scheduling for LLM Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17015v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has been popular to launch a series of LLM inferences -- we call an LLM application -- to better solve real-world problems. When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the schedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed worst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well for LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained resource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a fair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel scheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses a simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand prediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay. We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling efficiency with fairness preserved.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Visual Localization with Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03177v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of client-server localization, where edge device users communicate visual data with the service provider for locating oneself against a pre-built 3D map. This localization paradigm is a crucial component for location-based services in AR/VR or mobile applications, as it is not trivial to store large-scale 3D maps and process fast localization on resource-limited edge devices. Nevertheless, conventional client-server localization systems possess numerous challenges in computational efficiency, robustness, and privacy-preservation during data transmission. Our work aims to jointly solve these challenges with a localization pipeline based on event cameras. By using event cameras, our system consumes low energy and maintains small memory bandwidth. Then during localization, we propose applying event-to-image conversion and leverage mature image-based localization, which achieves robustness even in low-light or fast-moving scenes. To further enhance privacy protection, we introduce privacy protection techniques at two levels. Network level protection aims to hide the entire user's view in private scenes using a novel split inference approach, while sensor level protection aims to hide sensitive user details such as faces with light-weight filtering. Both methods involve small client-side computation and localization performance loss, while significantly mitigating the feeling of insecurity as revealed in our user study. We thus project our method to serve as a building block for practical location-based services using event cameras.

However, existing methods are often computationally expensive, and the field lacks standardized benchmarks for fair comparison. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a twofold contribution. First, we develop and open-source FJNDF-Pytorch, a unified benchmark for frequency-domain JND-Guided pre-filters. Second, leveraging this platform, we propose a complete learning framework for a novel, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art compression efficiency, consistently outperforming competitors across multiple datasets and encoders. In terms of computational cost, our model is exceptionally lightweight, requiring only 7.15 GFLOPs to process a 1080p image, which is merely 14.1% of the cost of recent lightweight network. Our work presents a robust, state-of-the-art solution that excels in both performance and efficiency, supported by a reproducible research platform. The open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/viplab-fudan/FJNDF-Pytorch.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[MGTS-Net: Exploring Graph-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Augmented Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16350v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research in time series forecasting has explored integrating multimodal features into models to improve accuracy. However, the accuracy of such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Light-Weight Diffusion Multiplier and Uncertainty Quantification for Fourier Neural Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00643v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operator learning is a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential equations, with Fourier Neural Operators serving as a widely adopted foundation. However, FNOs face significant scalability challenges due to overparameterization and offer no native uncertainty quantification -- a key requirement for reliable scientific and engineering applications. Instead, neural operators rely on post hoc UQ methods that ignore geometric inductive biases. In this work, we introduce DINOZAUR: a diffusion-based neural operator parametrization with uncertainty quantification. Inspired by the structure of the heat kernel, DINOZAUR replaces the dense tensor multiplier in FNOs with a dimensionality-independent diffusion multiplier that has a single learnable time parameter per channel, drastically reducing parameter count and memory footprint without compromising predictive performance. By defining priors over those time parameters, we cast DINOZAUR as a Bayesian neural operator to yield spatially correlated outputs and calibrated uncertainty estimates. Our method achieves competitive or superior performance across several PDE benchmarks while providing efficient uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[VRS-UIE: Value-Driven Reordering Scanning for Underwater Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01224v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a promising backbone for vision tasks due to their linear complexity and global receptive field. However, in the context of Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE), the standard sequential scanning mechanism is fundamentally challenged by the unique statistical distribution characteristics of underwater scenes. The predominance of large-portion, homogeneous but useless oceanic backgrounds can dilute the feature representation responses of sparse yet valuable targets, thereby impeding effective state propagation and compromising the model's ability to preserve both local semantics and global structure. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Value-Driven Reordering Scanning framework for UIE, termed VRS-UIE. Its core innovation is a Multi-Granularity Value Guidance Learning (MVGL) module that generates a pixel-aligned value map to dynamically reorder the SSM's scanning sequence. This prioritizes informative regions to facilitate the long-range state propagation of salient features. Building upon the MVGL, we design a Mamba-Conv Mixer (MCM) block that synergistically integrates priority-driven global sequencing with dynamically adjusted local convolutions, thereby effectively modeling both large-portion oceanic backgrounds and high-value semantic targets. A Cross-Feature Bridge (CFB) further refines multi-level feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VRS-UIE framework sets a new state-of-the-art, delivering superior enhancement performance (surpassing WMamba by 0.89 dB on average) by effectively suppressing water bias and preserving structural and color fidelity. Furthermore, by incorporating efficient convolutional operators and resolution rescaling, we construct a light-weight yet effective scheme, VRS-UIE-S, suitable for real-time UIE applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniLens: Towards Universal Lens Aberration Correction via LensLib-to-Specific Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05809v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging universal Computational Aberration Correction (CAC) paradigms provide an inspiring solution to light-weight and high-quality imaging with a universal model trained on a lens library (LensLib) to address arbitrary lens aberrations blindly. However, the limited coverage of existing LensLibs leads to poor generalization of the trained models to unseen lenses, whose fine-tuning pipeline is also confined to the lens-descriptions-known case. In this work, we introduce OmniLens, a flexible solution to universal CAC via (i) establishing a convincing LensLib with comprehensive coverage for pre-training a robust base model, and (ii) adapting the model to any specific lens designs with unknown lens descriptions via fast LensLib-to-specific domain adaptation. To achieve these, an Evolution-based Automatic Optical Design (EAOD) pipeline is proposed to generate a rich variety of lens samples with realistic aberration behaviors. Then, we design an unsupervised regularization term for efficient domain adaptation on a few easily accessible real-captured images based on the statistical observation of dark channel priors in degradation induced by lens aberrations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LensLib generated by EAOD effectively develops a universal CAC model with strong generalization capabilities, which can also improve the non-blind lens-specific methods by 0.35-1.81dB in PSNR. Additionally, the proposed domain adaptation method significantly improves the base model, especially in severe aberration cases (at most 2.59dB in PSNR).

| **[Gaussian Semantic Field for One-shot LiDAR Global Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12101v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a one-shot LiDAR global localization algorithm featuring semantic disambiguation ability based on a lightweight tri-layered scene graph. While landmark semantic registration-based methods have shown promising performance improvements in global localization compared with geometric-only methods, landmarks can be repetitive and misleading for correspondence establishment. We propose to mitigate this problem by modeling semantic distributions with continuous functions learned from a population of Gaussian processes. Compared with discrete semantic labels, the continuous functions capture finer-grained geo-semantic information and also provide more detailed metric information for correspondence establishment. We insert this continuous function as the middle layer between the object layer and the metric-semantic layer, forming a tri-layered 3D scene graph, serving as a light-weight yet performant backend for one-shot localization. We term our global localization pipeline Outram-GSF (Gaussian semantic field) and conduct a wide range of experiments on publicly available data sets, validating the superior performance against the current state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

Viewing programs as heterogeneous graphs, we capture control- and data-flow relations as complex interaction networks. Our hybrid framework combines these graph representations with light-weight (<4B) local LLMs, uniting topological features with semantic reasoning while avoiding the cost and privacy concerns of large cloud models. Evaluated on Java vulnerability detection (binary classification), our method achieves 93.57% accuracy-an 8.36% gain over Graph Attention Network-based embeddings and 17.81% over pretrained LLM baselines such as Qwen2.5 Coder 3B. Beyond accuracy, the approach extracts salient subgraphs and generates natural language explanations, improving interpretability for developers. These results pave the way for scalable, explainable, and locally deployable tools that can shift vulnerability analysis from purely syntactic checks to deeper structural and semantic insights, facilitating broader adoption in real-world secure software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, 14 equations, accepted at the 14th International Conference on Complex Networks and Their Applications (COMPLEX NETWORKS 2025) and the conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Studies in Computational Intelligence series</p></details> |
| **[LTGS: Long-Term Gaussian Scene Chronology From Sparse View Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09881v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures. However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations, significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines while enabling fast and light-weight updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Light Weight Cryptographic Solution for 6LoWPAN Protocol Stack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14993v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lightweight cryptography is an emerging field in the field of research, which endorses algorithms which are best suited for constrained environment. Design metrics like Gate Equivalence (GE), Memory Requirement, Power Consumption, and Throughput play a vital role in the applications like IoT. This paper presents the 6LoWPAN Protocol Stack which is a popular standard of communication for constrained devices. This paper presents an implementation of a lightweight 6LoWPAN Protocol stack by using a Light weight Cipher instead of regular heavy encryption cipher AES. The cipher proposed in this paper is specifically suitable for 6LoWPAN architecture as it addresses all the constraints possessed by wireless sensor nodes. The lightweight cipher proposed in the paper needs only 1856 bytes of FLASH and 1272 bytes of RAM memory which is less than any other standard existing lightweight cipher design. The proposed ciphers power consumption is around 25 mW which is significantly less as compared to ISO certified lightweight cipher PRESENT which consumes around 38 mW of dynamic power. This paper also discusses the detailed analysis of cipher against the attacks like Linear Cryptanalysis, Differential Cryptanalysis, Biclique attack and Avalanche attack. The cipher implementation on hardware is around 1051 GEs for 64 bit of block size with 128 bit of key length which is less as compared to existing lightweight cipher design. The proposed cipher LiCi2 is motivated from LiCi cipher design but outclasses it in every design metric. We believe the design of LiCi2 is the obvious choice for researchers to implement in constrained environments like IoT.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Despite their remarkable success, these empirical designs still lack theoretical justifications or interpretations, thus hindering potentially principled improvements. In this paper, we argue that there are fundamental connections between semantic segmentation and compression, especially between the Transformer decoders and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). From such a perspective, we derive a white-box, fully attentional DEcoder for PrIncipled semantiC segemenTation (DEPICT), with the interpretations as follows: 1) the self-attention operator refines image embeddings to construct an ideal principal subspace that aligns with the supervision and retains most information; 2) the cross-attention operator seeks to find a low-rank approximation of the refined image embeddings, which is expected to be a set of orthonormal bases of the principal subspace and corresponds to the predefined classes; 3) the dot-product operation yields compact representation for image embeddings as segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on dataset ADE20K find that DEPICT consistently outperforms its black-box counterpart, Segmenter, and it is light weight and more robust.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2024.

Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection, hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).</p></details> | 14 pages, 17 figures |

Traditional approaches often rely on rule-based or task-specific models, which struggle to generalize across domains and schema variations. In this paper, we present MeXtract, a family of lightweight language models designed for metadata extraction from scientific papers. The models, ranging from 0.5B to 3B parameters, are built by fine-tuning Qwen 2.5 counterparts. In their size family, MeXtract achieves state-of-the-art performance on metadata extraction on the MOLE benchmark. To further support evaluation, we extend the MOLE benchmark to incorporate model-specific metadata, providing an out-of-domain challenging subset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning on a given schema not only yields high accuracy but also transfers effectively to unseen schemas, demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of our approach. We release all the code, datasets, and models openly for the research community.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Consensus Graphs (ConGrs), a flexible DAG-based data structure that represents shared information, as well as semantic variation in a set of sampled LM responses to the same prompt. We construct ConGrs using a light-weight lexical sequence alignment algorithm from bioinformatics, supplemented by the targeted usage of a secondary LM judge. Further, we design task-dependent decoding methods to synthesize a single, final response from our ConGr data structure. Our experiments show that synthesizing responses from ConGrs improves factual precision on two biography generation tasks by up to 31% over an average response and reduces reliance on LM judges by more than 80% compared to other methods. We also use ConGrs for three refusal-based tasks requiring abstention on unanswerable queries and find that abstention rate is increased by up to 56%. We apply our approach to the MATH and AIME reasoning tasks and find an improvement over self-verification and majority vote baselines by up to 6 points of accuracy. We show that ConGrs provide a flexible method for capturing variation in LM responses and using the epistemic signals provided by response variation to synthesize more effective responses.</p></details> |  |

Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal, Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment standards.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

We introduce Car Models in Time (CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models, a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023), supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging, evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies: time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs. CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained visual recognition and generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in NeurIPS 2025 Track on Datasets and Benchmarks</p></details> |

Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS'25 Accepted, Oral</p></details> |

However, existing replay-based CIL methods fail to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to severe domain discrepancies and class imbalance inherent in endoscopic imaging. To tackle these challenges, we propose EndoCIL, a novel and unified CIL framework specifically tailored for endoscopic image diagnosis. EndoCIL incorporates three key components: Maximum Mean Discrepancy Based Replay (MDBR), employing a distribution-aligned greedy strategy to select diverse and representative exemplars, Prior Regularized Class Balanced Loss (PRCBL), designed to alleviate both inter-phase and intra-phase class imbalance by integrating prior class distributions and balance weights into the loss function, and Calibration of Fully-Connected Gradients (CFG), which adjusts the classifier gradients to mitigate bias toward new classes. Extensive experiments conducted on four public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that EndoCIL generally outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods across varying buffer sizes and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework effectively balances stability and plasticity in lifelong endoscopic diagnosis, showing promising potential for clinical scalability and deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning After Model Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17160v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In classic supervised learning, once a model is deployed in an application, it is fixed. No updates will be made to it during the application. This is inappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples from unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be able to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after they are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model Deployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human engineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other knowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an unfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection of novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new classes are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in traditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised learning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and incrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the past data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered classes, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two challenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes often appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and incremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will demonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ECAI-2025</p></details> |
| **[The Bayesian Approach to Continual Learning: An Overview](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08922v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is an online paradigm where a learner continually accumulates knowledge from different tasks encountered over sequential time steps. Importantly, the learner is required to extend and update its knowledge without forgetting about the learning experience acquired from the past, and while avoiding the need to retrain from scratch. Given its sequential nature and its resemblance to the way humans think, continual learning offers an opportunity to address several challenges which currently stand in the way of widening the range of applicability of deep models to further real-world problems. The continual need to update the learner with data arriving sequentially strikes inherent congruence between continual learning and Bayesian inference which provides a principal platform to keep updating the prior beliefs of a model given new data, without completely forgetting the knowledge acquired from the old data. This survey inspects different settings of Bayesian continual learning, namely task-incremental learning and class-incremental learning. We begin by discussing definitions of continual learning along with its Bayesian setting, as well as the links with related fields, such as domain adaptation, transfer learning and meta-learning. Afterwards, we introduce a taxonomy offering a comprehensive categorization of algorithms belonging to the Bayesian continual learning paradigm. Meanwhile, we analyze the state-of-the-art while zooming in on some of the most prominent Bayesian continual learning algorithms to date. Furthermore, we shed some light on links between continual learning and developmental psychology, and correspondingly introduce analogies between both fields. We follow that with a discussion of current challenges, and finally conclude with potential areas for future research on Bayesian continual learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Classifier Synergy: Reward-Aligned Learning via Mutual Boosting Loop for FSCIL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03608v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation, their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[FedGTEA: Federated Class-Incremental Learning with Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12927v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning, called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings, aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting, consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modular Embedding Recomposition for Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16463v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 36th British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC 2025), Sheffield, UK</p></details> |
| **[Resource-Constrained Federated Continual Learning: What Does Matter?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08737v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Continual Learning (FCL) aims to enable sequentially privacy-preserving model training on streams of incoming data that vary in edge devices by preserving previous knowledge while adapting to new data. Current FCL literature focuses on restricted data privacy and access to previously seen data while imposing no constraints on the training overhead. This is unreasonable for FCL applications in real-world scenarios, where edge devices are primarily constrained by resources such as storage, computational budget, and label rate. We revisit this problem with a large-scale benchmark and analyze the performance of state-of-the-art FCL approaches under different resource-constrained settings. Various typical FCL techniques and six datasets in two incremental learning scenarios (Class-IL and Domain-IL) are involved in our experiments. Through extensive experiments amounting to a total of over 1,000+ GPU hours, we find that, under limited resource-constrained settings, existing FCL approaches, with no exception, fail to achieve the expected performance. Our conclusions are consistent in the sensitivity analysis. This suggests that most existing FCL methods are particularly too resource-dependent for real-world deployment. Moreover, we study the performance of typical FCL techniques with resource constraints and shed light on future research directions in FCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.11165 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[DRL: Discriminative Representation Learning with Parallel Adapters for Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12107v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs), remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference phases.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Your VAR Model is Secretly an Efficient and Explainable Generative Classifier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12060v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gains: Fine-grained Federated Domain Adaptation in Open Set](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15967v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional federated learning (FL) assumes a closed world with a fixed total number of clients. In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL process in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two critical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and integrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing research focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices source domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a fine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains). Gains splits the model into an encoder and a classifier, empirically revealing features extracted by the encoder are sensitive to domain shifts while classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. Based on this, we develop fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation techniques to identify and incorporate new knowledge. Additionally, an anti-forgetting mechanism is designed to preserve source domain performance, ensuring balanced adaptation. Experimental results on multi-domain datasets across three typical data-shift scenarios demonstrate that Gains significantly outperforms other baselines in performance for both source-domain and target-domain clients.

| **[Continual Adapter Tuning with Semantic Shift Compensation for Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19979v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes while overcoming catastrophic forgetting. The introduction of pre-trained models has brought new tuning paradigms to CIL. In this paper, we revisit different parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods within the context of continual learning. We observe that adapter tuning demonstrates superiority over prompt-based methods, even without parameter expansion in each learning session. Motivated by this, we propose incrementally tuning the shared adapter without imposing parameter update constraints, enhancing the learning capacity of the backbone. Additionally, we employ feature sampling from stored prototypes to retrain a unified classifier, further improving its performance. We estimate the semantic shift of old prototypes without access to past samples and update stored prototypes session by session. Our proposed method eliminates model expansion and avoids retaining any image samples. It surpasses previous pre-trained model-based CIL methods and demonstrates remarkable continual learning capabilities. Experimental results on five CIL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal extension of SSIAT (CVPR 2024)</p></details> |

However, the scenario becomes particularly challenging when data samples are insufficient, requiring on-device few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) to maintain consistent model performance. Although existing work has explored parameter-efficient FSCIL frameworks based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), their deployment is still fundamentally constrained by limited device resources. Inspired by neural mechanisms, Spiking neural networks (SNNs) process spatiotemporal information efficiently, offering lower energy consumption, greater biological plausibility, and compatibility with neuromorphic hardware than ANNs. In this work, we present an SNN-based method for On-Device FSCIL, i.e., Sparsity-Aware and Fast Adaptive SNN (SAFA-SNN). We first propose sparsity-conditioned neuronal dynamics, in which most neurons remain stable while a subset stays active, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further cope with spike non-differentiability in gradient estimation, we employ zeroth-order optimization. Moreover, during incremental learning sessions, we enhance the discriminability of new classes through subspace projection, which alleviates overfitting to novel classes. Extensive experiments conducted on two standard benchmark datasets (CIFAR100 and Mini-ImageNet) and three neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR-10-DVS, DVS128gesture, and N-Caltech101) demonstrate that SAFA-SNN outperforms baseline methods, specifically achieving at least 4.01% improvement at the last incremental session on Mini-ImageNet and 20% lower energy cost over baseline methods with practical implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[EFC++: Elastic Feature Consolidation with Prototype Re-balancing for Cold Start Exemplar-free Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10439v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exemplar-free Class Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to learn from a sequence of tasks without having access to previous task data. In this paper, we consider the challenging Cold Start scenario in which insufficient data is available in the first task to learn a high-quality backbone. This is especially challenging for EFCIL since it requires high plasticity, resulting in feature drift which is difficult to compensate for in the exemplar-free setting. To address this problem, we propose an effective approach to consolidate feature representations by regularizing drift in directions highly relevant to previous tasks while employing prototypes to reduce task-recency bias. Our approach, which we call Elastic Feature Consolidation++ (EFC++) exploits a tractable second-order approximation of feature drift based on a proposed Empirical Feature Matrix (EFM). The EFM induces a pseudo-metric in feature space which we use to regularize feature drift in important directions and to update Gaussian prototypes. In addition, we introduce a post-training prototype re-balancing phase that updates classifiers to compensate for feature drift. Experimental results on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-Subset, ImageNet-1K and DomainNet demonstrate that EFC++ is better able to learn new tasks by maintaining model plasticity and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of our previous conference paper https://openreview.net/forum?id=7D9X2cFnt1</p></details> |
| **[Forget Forgetting: Continual Learning in a World of Abundant Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07274v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) has traditionally focused on minimizing exemplar memory, a constraint often misaligned with modern systems where GPU time, not storage, is the primary bottleneck. This paper challenges this paradigm by investigating a more realistic regime: one where memory is abundant enough to mitigate forgetting, but full retraining from scratch remains prohibitively expensive. In this practical "middle ground", we find that the core challenge shifts from stability to plasticity, as models become biased toward prior tasks and struggle to learn new ones. Conversely, improved stability allows simple replay baselines to outperform the state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the GPU cost. To address this newly surfaced trade-off, we propose Weight Space Consolidation, a lightweight method that combines (1) rank-based parameter resets to restore plasticity with (2) weight averaging to enhance stability. Validated on both class-incremental learning with image classifiers and continual instruction tuning with large language models, our approach outperforms strong baselines while matching the low computational cost of replay, offering a scalable alternative to expensive full-retraining. These findings challenge long-standing CL assumptions and establish a new, cost-efficient baseline for real-world CL systems where exemplar memory is no longer the limiting factor.</p></details> | 24 pages, 11 figures |
| **[StPR: Spatiotemporal Preservation and Routing for Exemplar-Free Video Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13997v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Class-Incremental Learning (VCIL) seeks to develop models that continuously learn new action categories over time without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Unlike traditional Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), VCIL introduces the added complexity of spatiotemporal structures, making it particularly challenging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while effectively capturing both frame-shared semantics and temporal dynamics. Existing approaches either rely on exemplar rehearsal, raising concerns over memory and privacy, or adapt static image-based methods that neglect temporal modeling. To address these limitations, we propose Spatiotemporal Preservation and Routing (StPR), a unified and exemplar-free VCIL framework that explicitly disentangles and preserves spatiotemporal information. First, we introduce Frame-Shared Semantics Distillation (FSSD), which identifies semantically stable and meaningful channels by jointly considering semantic sensitivity and classification contribution. These important semantic channels are selectively regularized to maintain prior knowledge while allowing for adaptation. Second, we design a Temporal Decomposition-based Mixture-of-Experts (TD-MoE), which dynamically routes task-specific experts based on their temporal dynamics, enabling inference without task ID or stored exemplars. Together, StPR effectively leverages spatial semantics and temporal dynamics, achieving a unified, exemplar-free VCIL framework. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics400 show that our method outperforms existing baselines while offering improved interpretability and efficiency in VCIL.

Test-time adaptation (TTA) provides a promising solution but often relies on gradient-based updates or prompt tuning, limiting flexibility and practicality. We propose Emo-TTA, a lightweight, training-free adaptation framework that incrementally updates class-conditional statistics via an Expectation-Maximization procedure for explicit test-time distribution estimation, using ALM predictions as priors. Emo-TTA operates on individual test samples without modifying model weights. Experiments on six out-of-domain SER benchmarks show consistent accuracy improvements over prior TTA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of statistical adaptation in aligning model predictions with evolving test distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Avoid Catastrophic Forgetting with Rank-1 Fisher from Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23593v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation (EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1 variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular, forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks, while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.</p></details> | 18 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Toward a Holistic Approach to Continual Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23592v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular, conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information. Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Workshop on Continual Learning in Computer Vision, ICCV 2025</p></details> |
