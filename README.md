| **[AlphaNet: Scaling Up Local-frame-based Atomistic Interatomic Potential](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07155v4)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular dynamics simulations demand an unprecedented combination of accuracy and scalability to tackle grand challenges in catalysis and materials design. To bridge this gap, we present AlphaNet, a local-frame-based equivariant model that simultaneously improves computational efficiency and predictive precision for interatomic interactions. By constructing equivariant local frames with learnable geometric transitions, AlphaNet encodes atomic environments with enhanced representational capacity, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in energy and force predictions. Extensive benchmarks on large-scale datasets spanning molecular reactions, crystal stability, and surface catalysis (Matbench Discovery and OC2M) demonstrate its superior performance over existing neural network interatomic potentials while ensuring scalability across diverse system sizes with varying types of interatomic interactions. The synergy of accuracy, efficiency, and transferability positions AlphaNet as a transformative tool for modeling multiscale phenomena, decoding dynamics in catalysis and functional interfaces, with direct implications for accelerating the discovery of complex molecular systems and functional materials.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00142v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel graph neural network (GNN) designed to operate in hyperbolic spaces, leveraging the Lorentzian model to enhance graph representation learning. Existing GNNs primarily operate in Euclidean spaces, which can limit their ability to capture hierarchical and multi-relational structures inherent to complex graphs. LGIN addresses this by incorporating curvature-aware aggregation functions that preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor, ensuring embeddings remain constrained within the hyperbolic space by proposing a new update rule that effectively captures both local neighborhood interactions and global structural properties, enabling LGIN to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs with expressiveness at least as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Through extensive evaluation across nine benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures, LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNNs, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy in modeling complex graph structures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to extend the concept of a powerful graph neural network to Riemannian manifolds, paving the way for future advancements in hyperbolic graph learning. The code for our paper can be found at https://github.com/Deceptrax123/LGIN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under Review</p></details> |
| **[Run-Length-Limited ISI-Mitigation (RLIM) Coding for Molecular Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15955v2)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inter-symbol interference (ISI) is a significant challenge in diffusion-based communication channels, where residual molecules from previous transmissions interfere with the current signal interval, leading to detection errors. We introduce a new infinite family of coding schemes, which we name RLIM, that require each 1-bit to be followed by at least i consecutive 0-bits, where i is any chosen positive integer. This enhances ISI mitigation and improves error correction capabilities compared to existing ISI-mitigating channel codes. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the codebooks derived from the proposed RLIM scheme significantly reduce bit error rate compared to prominent coding methods. Simulation results also reveal that an important constraint in RLIM codes is redundant under zero-drift conditions, removal of which makes them equivalent to run-length-limited (RLL) codes. Notably, despite this equivalence, the proposed family of RLIM coding schemes retains a distinct power optimization constraint and employs a specialized error correction algorithm, preserving its unique character and advantages. Furthermore, in diffusion-based channels with time-varying drift, the previously redundant constraint becomes critical for ensuring robust detection, thus demonstrating the enhanced applicability of proposed RLIM codes for such channels as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adjoint Sampling: Highly Scalable Diffusion Samplers via Adjoint Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11713v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Adjoint Sampling, a highly scalable and efficient algorithm for learning diffusion processes that sample from unnormalized densities, or energy functions. It is the first on-policy approach that allows significantly more gradient updates than the number of energy evaluations and model samples, allowing us to scale to much larger problem settings than previously explored by similar methods. Our framework is theoretically grounded in stochastic optimal control and shares the same theoretical guarantees as Adjoint Matching, being able to train without the need for corrective measures that push samples towards the target distribution. We show how to incorporate key symmetries, as well as periodic boundary conditions, for modeling molecules in both cartesian and torsional coordinates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on classical energy functions, and further scale up to neural network-based energy models where we perform amortized conformer generation across many molecular systems. To encourage further research in developing highly scalable sampling methods, we plan to open source these challenging benchmarks, where successful methods can directly impact progress in computational chemistry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating new coordination compounds via multireference simulations, genetic algorithms and machine learning: the case of Co(II) molecular magnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13749v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of coordination compounds with target properties often requires years of continuous feedback loop between theory, simulations and experiments. In the case of magnetic molecules, this conventional strategy has indeed led to the breakthrough of single-molecule magnets with working temperatures above nitrogen's boiling point, but at significant costs in terms of resources and time. Here, we propose a computational strategy able to accelerate the discovery of new coordination compounds with desired electronic and magnetic properties. Our approach is based on a combination of high-throughput multireference ab initio methods, genetic algorithms and machine learning. While genetic algorithms allow for an intelligent sampling of the vast chemical space available, machine learning reduces the computational cost by pre-screening molecular properties in advance of their accurate and automated multireference ab initio characterization. Importantly, the presented framework is able to generate novel organic ligands and explore chemical motifs beyond those available in pre-existing structural databases. We showcase the power of this approach by automatically generating new Co(II) mononuclear coordination compounds with record magnetic properties in a fraction of the time required by either experiments or brute-force ab initio approaches</p></details> |  |
| **[E(3)-equivariant models cannot learn chirality: Field-based molecular generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15864v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obtaining the desired effect of drugs is highly dependent on their molecular geometries. Thus, the current prevailing paradigm focuses on 3D point-cloud atom representations, utilizing graph neural network (GNN) parametrizations, with rotational symmetries baked in via E(3) invariant layers. We prove that such models must necessarily disregard chirality, a geometric property of the molecules that cannot be superimposed on their mirror image by rotation and translation. Chirality plays a key role in determining drug safety and potency. To address this glaring issue, we introduce a novel field-based representation, proposing reference rotations that replace rotational symmetry constraints. The proposed model captures all molecular geometries including chirality, while still achieving highly competitive performance with E(3)-based methods across standard benchmarking metrics.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Subgraph Aggregation for Out-of-Distribution Generalization on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22228v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has gained significant attention due to its critical importance in graph-based predictions in real-world scenarios. Existing methods primarily focus on extracting a single causal subgraph from the input graph to achieve generalizable predictions. However, relying on a single subgraph can lead to susceptibility to spurious correlations and is insufficient for learning invariant patterns behind graph data. Moreover, in many real-world applications, such as molecular property prediction, multiple critical subgraphs may influence the target label property. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, SubGraph Aggregation (SuGAr), designed to learn a diverse set of subgraphs that are crucial for OOD generalization on graphs. Specifically, SuGAr employs a tailored subgraph sampler and diversity regularizer to extract a diverse set of invariant subgraphs. These invariant subgraphs are then aggregated by averaging their representations, which enriches the subgraph signals and enhances coverage of the underlying causal structures, thereby improving OOD generalization. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that \ours outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 24% improvement in OOD generalization on graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study graph OOD generalization by learning multiple invariant subgraphs. code: https://github.com/Nanolbw/SuGAr</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal machine learning with large language embedding model for polymer property prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22962v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have harnessed extensive computational power and diverse text corpora to achieve remarkable proficiency in interpreting and generating domain-specific content, including materials science. To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chemist-X: Large Language Model-empowered Agent for Reaction Condition Recommendation in Chemical Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10776v6)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent AI research plots a promising future of automatic chemical reactions within the chemistry society. This study proposes Chemist-X, a comprehensive AI agent that automates the reaction condition optimization (RCO) task in chemical synthesis with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology and AI-controlled wet-lab experiment executions. To begin with, as an emulation on how chemical experts solve the RCO task, Chemist-X utilizes a novel RAG scheme to interrogate available molecular and literature databases to narrow the searching space for later processing. The agent then leverages a computer-aided design (CAD) tool we have developed through a large language model (LLM) supervised programming interface. With updated chemical knowledge obtained via RAG, as well as the ability in using CAD tools, our agent significantly outperforms conventional RCO AIs confined to the fixed knowledge within its training data. Finally, Chemist-X interacts with the physical world through an automated robotic system, which can validate the suggested chemical reaction condition without human interventions. The control of the robotic system was achieved with a novel algorithm we have developed for the equipment, which relies on LLMs for reliable script generation. Results of our automatic wet-lab experiments, achieved by fully LLM-supervised end-to-end operation with no human in the lope, prove Chemist-X's ability in self-driving laboratories.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Formalization of Co-Transcriptional Splicing as an Operation on Formal Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13354v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RNA co-transcriptionality is the process where RNA sequences are spliced while being transcribed from DNA templates. This process holds potential as a key tool for molecular programming. Co-transcriptional folding has been shown to be programmable for assembling nano-scale RNA structures, and recent advances have proven its Turing universality. While post-transcriptional splicing has been extensively studied, co-transcriptional splicing is gaining attention for its potential to save resources and space in molecular systems. However, its unpredictability has limited its practical applications. In this paper, we focus on engineering co-transcriptional splicing, moving beyond natural occurrences to program RNA sequences that produce specific target sequences through DNA templates. We introduce a formal model of co-transcriptional splicing, defined by constant-, linear-, and logarithmic-bounded hairpin deletion operations, as well as an unbounded hairpin deletion operation. We examine the complexity of the template constructability problem associated with these operations and study the closure properties of the languages they generate, providing insights for RNA template design in molecular programming systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 2 tables, 1 figure, under review in Natural Computing</p></details> |

We present PDeepPP, a deep learning framework that integrates pretrained protein language models with parallel transformer-CNN architectures, achieving state-of-the-art performance in peptide characterization tasks. The model's hybrid architecture demonstrates unique capabilities in capturing both local sequence motifs and global structural features, as evidenced by 29% improved cluster separation in UMAP visualizations compared to conventional approaches. Evaluated across 33 biological recognition tasks - including post-translational modification site prediction and bioactive peptide identification - PDeepPP outperformed existing methods in 25 tasks with average AUC improvements of 4.2%. Notably, it achieved 0.9726 accuracy with PR AUC 0.9977 in antimicrobial peptide detection while reducing false negatives by 37.5% in antimalarial recognition scenarios. This framework enables accurate large-scale peptide analysis, achieving 218* acceleration over sequence-alignment-based methods while maintaining 99.5% specificity in critical glycosylation site detection.PDeepPP establishes a new paradigm for computational peptide analysis through its synergistic architecture design, enabling rapid yet precise functional annotation that bridges molecular pattern recognition with translational biomedical applications.We have made our implementation, including code, data, and pretrained models, publicly available via GitHub (https://github.com/fondress/PDeepPP) and Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/fondress/PDeppPP).</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables, submitted to arXiv</p></details> |
| **[The Dissipation Theory of Aging: A Quantitative Analysis Using a Cellular Aging Map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13044v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new theory for aging based on dynamical systems and provide a data-driven computational method to quantify the changes at the cellular level. We use ergodic theory to decompose the dynamics of changes during aging and show that aging is fundamentally a dissipative process within biological systems, akin to dynamical systems where dissipation occurs due to non-conservative forces. To quantify the dissipation dynamics, we employ a transformer-based machine learning algorithm to analyze gene expression data, incorporating age as a token to assess how age-related dissipation is reflected in the embedding space. By evaluating the dynamics of gene and age embeddings, we provide a cellular aging map (CAM) and identify patterns indicative of divergence in gene embedding space, nonlinear transitions, and entropy variations during aging for various tissues and cell types. Our results provide a novel perspective on aging as a dissipative process and introduce a computational framework that enables measuring age-related changes with molecular resolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling Molecular Moieties through Hierarchical Grad-CAM Graph Explainability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01744v4)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Virtual Screening (VS) has become an essential tool in drug discovery, enabling the rapid and cost-effective identification of potential bioactive molecules. Among recent advancements, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to model complex molecular structures using graph-based representations. However, the integration of explainable methods to elucidate the specific contributions of molecular substructures to biological activity remains a significant challenge. This limitation hampers both the interpretability of predictive models and the rational design of novel therapeutics.\\ Results: We trained 20 GNN models on a dataset of small molecules with the goal of predicting their activity on 20 distinct protein targets from the Kinase family. These classifiers achieved state-of-the-art performance in virtual screening tasks, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness on different targets. Building upon these models, we implemented the Hierarchical Grad-CAM graph Explainer (HGE) framework, enabling an in-depth analysis of the molecular moieties driving protein-ligand binding stabilization. HGE exploits Grad-CAM explanations at the atom, ring, and whole-molecule levels, leveraging the message-passing mechanism to highlight the most relevant chemical moieties. Validation against experimental data from the literature confirmed the ability of the explainer to recognize a molecular pattern of drugs and correctly annotate them to the known target. Conclusion: Our approach may represent a valid support to shorten both the screening and the hit discovery process. Detailed knowledge of the molecular substructures that play a role in the binding process can help the computational chemist to gain insights into the structure optimization, as well as in drug repurposing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical reweighting for estimation of fluctuation formulas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11968v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a variance reduction method for calculating transport coefficients in molecular dynamics using an importance sampling method via Girsanov's theorem applied to Green--Kubo's formula. We optimize the magnitude of the perturbation applied to the reference dynamics by means of a scalar parameter~$\alpha$ and propose an asymptotic analysis to fully characterize the long-time behavior in order to evaluate the possible variance reduction. Theoretical results corroborated by numerical results show that this method allows for some reduction in variance, although rather modest in most situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[De Novo Generation of Hit-like Molecules from Gene Expression Profiles via Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19422v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>De novo generation of hit-like molecules is a challenging task in the drug discovery process. Most methods in previous studies learn the semantics and syntax of molecular structures by analyzing molecular graphs or simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings; however, they do not take into account the drug responses of the biological systems consisting of genes and proteins. In this study we propose a hybrid neural network, HNN2Mol, which utilizes gene expression profiles to generate molecular structures with desirable phenotypes for arbitrary target proteins. In the algorithm, a variational autoencoder is employed as a feature extractor to learn the latent feature distribution of the gene expression profiles. Then, a long short-term memory is leveraged as the chemical generator to produce syntactically valid SMILES strings that satisfy the feature conditions of the gene expression profile extracted by the feature extractor. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that the proposed HNN2Mol model can produce new molecules with potential bioactivities and drug-like properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design Editing for Offline Model-based Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13964v4)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to maximize a black-box objective function using only an offline dataset of designs and scores. These tasks span various domains, such as robotics, material design, and protein and molecular engineering. A common approach involves training a surrogate model using existing designs and their corresponding scores, and then generating new designs through gradient-based updates with respect to the surrogate model. This method suffers from the out-of-distribution issue, where the surrogate model may erroneously predict high scores for unseen designs. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method, Design Editing for Offline Model-based Optimization (DEMO), which leverages a diffusion prior to calibrate overly optimized designs. DEMO first generates pseudo design candidates by performing gradient ascent with respect to a surrogate model. While these pseudo design candidates contain information beyond the offline dataset, they might be invalid or have erroneously high predicted scores. Therefore, to address this challenge while utilizing the information provided by pseudo design candidates, we propose an editing process to refine these pseudo design candidates. We introduce noise to the pseudo design candidates and subsequently denoise them with a diffusion prior trained on the offline dataset, ensuring they align with the distribution of valid designs. Empirical evaluations on seven offline MBO tasks show that, with properly tuned hyperparameters, DEMOs score is competitive with the best previously reported scores in the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |
| **[Physics Informed Constrained Learning of Dynamics from Static Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12675v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A physics-informed neural network (PINN) models the dynamics of a system by integrating the governing physical laws into the architecture of a neural network. By enforcing physical laws as constraints, PINN overcomes challenges with data scarsity and potentially high dimensionality. Existing PINN frameworks rely on fully observed time-course data, the acquisition of which could be prohibitive for many systems. In this study, we developed a new PINN learning paradigm, namely Constrained Learning, that enables the approximation of first-order derivatives or motions using non-time course or partially observed data. Computational principles and a general mathematical formulation of Constrained Learning were developed. We further introduced MPOCtrL (Message Passing Optimization-based Constrained Learning) an optimization approach tailored for the Constrained Learning framework that strives to balance the fitting of physical models and observed data. Its code is available at github link: https://github.com/ptdang1001/MPOCtrL Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrated that MPOCtrL can effectively detect the nonlinear dependency between observed data and the underlying physical properties of the system. In particular, on the task of metabolic flux analysis, MPOCtrL outperforms all existing data-driven flux estimators.</p></details> | 39 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Multi-Parameter Molecular MRI Quantification using Physics-Informed Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06447v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biophysical model fitting plays a key role in obtaining quantitative parameters from physiological signals and images. However, the model complexity for molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often translates into excessive computation time, which makes clinical use impractical. Here, we present a generic computational approach for solving the parameter extraction inverse problem posed by ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling coupled with experimental measurement of the system dynamics. This is achieved by formulating a numerical ODE solver to function as a step-wise analytical one, thereby making it compatible with automatic differentiation-based optimization. This enables efficient gradient-based model fitting, and provides a new approach to parameter quantification based on self-supervised learning from a single data observation. The neural-network-based train-by-fit pipeline was used to quantify semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) amide proton exchange parameters in the human brain, in an in-vivo molecular MRI study (n = 4). The entire pipeline of the first whole brain quantification was completed in 18.3 $\pm$ 8.3 minutes. Reusing the single-subject-trained network for inference in new subjects took 1.0 $\pm$ 0.2 s, to provide results in agreement with literature values and scan-specific fit results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This project was funded by the European Union (ERC, BabyMagnet, project no. 101115639), the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology, Israel, and a grant from the Tel Aviv University Center for AI and Data Science (TAD, The Blavatnik AI and Data Science Fund).

| **[Uncertainty Quantification in Graph Neural Networks with Shallow Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12627v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized materials discovery by providing accurate and efficient predictions of molecular and material properties. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However, GNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data and it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge, we explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across diverse Density Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold Molecular Dynamics. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for unobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of lightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials modeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-entropy Advantage in Neural Networks' Generalizability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13145v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the central challenges in modern machine learning is understanding how neural networks generalize knowledge learned from training data to unseen test data. While numerous empirical techniques have been proposed to improve generalization, a theoretical understanding of the mechanism of generalization remains elusive. Here we introduce the concept of Boltzmann entropy into neural networks by re-conceptualizing such networks as hypothetical molecular systems where weights and biases are atomic coordinates, and the loss function is the potential energy. By employing molecular simulation algorithms, we compute entropy landscapes as functions of both training loss and test accuracy (or test loss), on networks with up to 1 million parameters, across four distinct machine learning tasks: arithmetic question, real-world tabular data, image recognition, and language modeling. Our results reveal the existence of high-entropy advantage, wherein high-entropy network states generally outperform those reached via conventional training techniques like stochastic gradient descent. This entropy advantage provides a thermodynamic explanation for neural network generalizability: the generalizable states occupy a larger part of the parameter space than its non-generalizable analog at low train loss. Furthermore, we find this advantage more pronounced in narrower neural networks, indicating a need for different training optimizers tailored to different sizes of networks.</p></details> |  |

To support both the application of GRN inference in studying gene regulation and the development of novel machine learning methods, we present a comprehensive review of machine learning based GRN inference methodologies, along with the datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used. Special emphasis is placed on the emerging role of cutting edge deep learning techniques in enhancing inference performance.

However, many chemical tasks require the processing of visual information, which cannot be successfully handled by existing chemical LLMs. This brings a growing need for models capable of integrating multimodal information in the chemical domain. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ChemVLM}, an open-source chemical multimodal large language model specifically designed for chemical applications. ChemVLM is trained on a carefully curated bilingual multimodal dataset that enhances its ability to understand both textual and visual chemical information, including molecular structures, reactions, and chemistry examination questions. We develop three datasets for comprehensive evaluation, tailored to Chemical Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Chemical Reasoning (MMCR), and Multimodal Molecule Understanding tasks.

Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the "dark chemical space" without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, most current methods only learn from images, despite many screens being inherently multimodal, as they involve both a chemical or genetic perturbation as well as an image-based readout. We hypothesized that incorporating chemical compound structure during self-supervised pre-training could improve learned representations of images in high-throughput microscopy screens. We introduce a representation learning framework, MICON (Molecular-Image Contrastive Learning), that models chemical compounds as treatments that induce counterfactual transformations of cell phenotypes. MICON significantly outperforms classical hand-crafted features such as CellProfiler and existing deep-learning-based representation learning methods in challenging evaluation settings where models must identify reproducible effects of drugs across independent replicates and data-generating centers. We demonstrate that incorporating chemical compound information into the learning process provides consistent improvements in our evaluation setting and that modeling compounds specifically as treatments in a causal framework outperforms approaches that directly align images and compounds in a single representation space. Our findings point to a new direction for representation learning in morphological profiling, suggesting that methods should explicitly account for the multimodal nature of microscopy screening data.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Elevating MC research requires developing advanced in vivo testbeds. We introduce the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model as the first versatile 3D in vivo MC platform. The CAM, a highly vascularized membrane in fertilized chicken eggs, is established in bioengineering, cancer research, and drug development. Its biological realism, reproducibility, and versatility make it ideal for next-generation MC testbeds, bridging proof-of-concept systems and practical applications. We comprehensively characterize the CAM model's properties and MC system relevance. Through experimental studies, we investigate fluorescent molecule distribution in the CAM's closed-loop vascular system. We derive an analytical model using the wrapped normal distribution to describe particle propagation in dispersive closed-loop systems dominated by diffusion and flow. Parametric models are developed to approximate particle dynamics in the CAM, with parameters estimated via nonlinear least squares curve fitting. A dataset of 69 regions from 25 eggs validates our models. We analyze parameter relationships and biological plausibility. Finally, we develop a parametric model for long-term particle behavior and liver accumulation in chick embryos.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.09875</p></details> |
| **[Generative Deep Learning Framework for Inverse Design of Fuels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12075v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the present work, a generative deep learning framework combining a Co-optimized Variational Autoencoder (Co-VAE) architecture with quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) techniques is developed to enable accelerated inverse design of fuels. The Co-VAE integrates a property prediction component coupled with the VAE latent space, enhancing molecular reconstruction and accurate estimation of Research Octane Number (RON) (chosen as the fuel property of interest). A subset of the GDB-13 database, enriched with a curated RON database, is used for model training. Hyperparameter tuning is further utilized to optimize the balance among reconstruction fidelity, chemical validity, and RON prediction. An independent regression model is then used to refine RON prediction, while a differential evolution algorithm is employed to efficiently navigate the VAE latent space and identify promising fuel molecule candidates with high RON. This methodology addresses the limitations of traditional fuel screening approaches by capturing complex structure-property relationships within a comprehensive latent representation. The generative model provides a flexible tool for systematically exploring vast chemical spaces, paving the way for discovering fuels with superior anti-knock properties. The demonstrated approach can be readily extended to incorporate additional fuel properties and synthesizability criteria to enhance applicability and reliability for de novo design of new fuels.</p></details> |  |

| **[Chemical Language Model Linker: blending text and molecules with modular adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20182v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models and multi-modal models has enabled the appealing idea of generating novel molecules from text descriptions. Generative modeling would shift the paradigm from relying on large-scale chemical screening to find molecules with desired properties to directly generating those molecules. However, multi-modal models combining text and molecules are often trained from scratch, without leveraging existing high-quality pretrained models. Training from scratch consumes more computational resources and prohibits model scaling. In contrast, we propose a lightweight adapter-based strategy named Chemical Language Model Linker (ChemLML). ChemLML blends the two single domain models and obtains conditional molecular generation from text descriptions while still operating in the specialized embedding spaces of the molecular domain. ChemLML can tailor diverse pretrained text models for molecule generation by training relatively few adapter parameters. We find that the choice of molecular representation used within ChemLML, SMILES versus SELFIES, has a strong influence on conditional molecular generation performance. SMILES is often preferable despite not guaranteeing valid molecules. We raise issues in using the entire PubChem dataset of molecules and their associated descriptions for evaluating molecule generation and provide a filtered version of the dataset as a generation test set. To demonstrate how ChemLML could be used in practice, we generate candidate protein inhibitors and use docking to assess their quality and also generate candidate membrane permeable molecules.</p></details> | 60 pages, 12 figures |

| **[Molecular Signal Reception in Complex Vessel Networks: The Role of the Network Topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15943v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The notion of synthetic molecular communication (MC) refers to the transmission of information via molecules and is largely foreseen for use within the human body, where traditional electromagnetic wave (EM)-based communication is impractical. MC is anticipated to enable innovative medical applications, such as early-stage tumor detection, targeted drug delivery, and holistic approaches like the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). Many of these applications involve parts of the human cardiovascular system (CVS), here referred to as networks, posing challenges for MC due to their complex, highly branched vessel structures. To gain a better understanding of how the topology of such branched vessel networks affects the reception of a molecular signal at a target location, e.g., the network outlet, we present a generic analytical end-to-end model that characterizes molecule propagation and reception in linear branched vessel networks (LBVNs). We specialize this generic model to any MC system employing superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as signaling molecules and a planar coil as receiver (RX). By considering components that have been previously established in testbeds, we effectively isolate the impact of the network topology and validate our theoretical model with testbed data. Additionally, we propose two metrics, namely the molecule delay and the multi-path spread, that relate the LBVN topology to the molecule dispersion induced by the network, thereby linking the network structure to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the target location. This allows the characterization of the SNR at any point in the network solely based on the network topology. Consequently, our framework can, e.g., be exploited for optimal sensor placement in the CVS or identification of suitable testbed topologies for given SNR requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted for presentation at IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2025; Added index terms and funding footnote, relaxed spacing, introduced notion of molecule flux in Eq.

| **[Towards A Universal Graph Structural Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10917v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large-scale pre-training have shown the potential to learn generalizable representations for downstream tasks. In the graph domain, however, capturing and transferring structural information across different graph domains remains challenging, primarily due to the inherent differences in topological patterns across various contexts. Additionally, most existing models struggle to capture the complexity of rich graph structures, leading to inadequate exploration of the embedding space. To address these challenges, we propose GFSE, a universal graph structural encoder designed to capture transferable structural patterns across diverse domains such as molecular graphs, social networks, and citation networks. GFSE is the first cross-domain graph structural encoder pre-trained with multiple self-supervised learning objectives. Built on a Graph Transformer, GFSE incorporates attention mechanisms informed by graph inductive bias, enabling it to encode intricate multi-level and fine-grained topological features. The pre-trained GFSE produces generic and theoretically expressive positional and structural encoding for graphs, which can be seamlessly integrated with various downstream graph feature encoders, including graph neural networks for vectorized features and Large Language Models for text-attributed graphs. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate GFSE's capability to significantly enhance the model's performance while requiring substantially less task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, GFSE achieves state-of-the-art performance in 81.6% evaluated cases, spanning diverse graph models and datasets, highlighting its potential as a powerful and versatile encoder for graph-structured data.</p></details> |  |

Conventional computational methods for identifying such materials are resource-intensive and not easily scalable. Recently, universal interatomic potential models have been developed using equivariant graph neural networks. These models are trained on extensive datasets of first-principles force and energy calculations. One can achieve significant computational advantages by leveraging them as the foundation for traditional methods of assessing the ionic conductivity, such as molecular dynamics or nudged elastic band techniques. However, the generalization error from model inference on diverse atomic structures arising in such calculations can compromise the reliability of the results. In this work, we propose an approach for the quick and reliable screening of ionic conductors through the analysis of a universal interatomic potential. Our method incorporates a set of heuristic structure descriptors that effectively employ the rich knowledge of the underlying model while requiring minimal generalization capabilities. Using our descriptors, we rank lithium-containing materials in the Materials Project database according to their expected ionic conductivity. Eight out of the ten highest-ranked materials are confirmed to be superionic at room temperature in first-principles calculations. Notably, our method achieves a speed-up factor of approximately 50 compared to molecular dynamics driven by a machine-learning potential, and is at least 3,000 times faster compared to first-principles molecular dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Large...</summary><p>Larger-scale AIMD validation of our predictions; minor text updates.

These models facilitate the understanding of matter and the discovery of new molecules and materials. In contrast to GNNs operating on a large homogeneous graphs, GNNs used by CFMs process a large number of geometric graphs of varying sizes, requiring different optimization strategies than those developed for large homogeneous GNNs. This paper presents optimizations for two critical phases of CFM training: data distribution and model training, targeting MACE - a state-of-the-art CFM. We address the challenge of load balancing in data distribution by formulating it as a multi-objective bin packing problem. We propose an iterative algorithm that provides a highly effective, fast, and practical solution, ensuring efficient data distribution. For the training phase, we identify symmetric tensor contraction as the key computational kernel in MACE and optimize this kernel to improve the overall performance. Our combined approach of balanced data distribution and kernel optimization significantly enhances the training process of MACE. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial speedup, reducing per-epoch execution time for training from 12 to 2 minutes on 740 GPUs with a 2.6M sample dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 34th ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC 2025)</p></details> |

Recent advances in protein language models (PLMs) have revolutionized computational protein analysis, enabling, among other things, more accurate predictions of mutational effects. In this work, we introduce JanusDDG, a deep learning framework that leverages PLM-derived embeddings and a bidirectional cross-attention transformer architecture to predict $\Delta \Delta G$ of single and multiple-residue mutations while simultaneously being constrained to respect fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as antisymmetry and transitivity. Unlike conventional self-attention, JanusDDG computes queries (Q) and values (V) as the difference between wild-type and mutant embeddings, while keys (K) alternate between the two. This cross-interleaved attention mechanism enables the model to capture mutation-induced perturbations while preserving essential contextual information. Experimental results show that JanusDDG achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting $\Delta \Delta G$ from sequence alone, matching or exceeding the accuracy of structure-based methods for both single and multiple mutations.

This work presents a computational methodology for searching for pathways in reaction networks which is based on integer linear programming and the modeling of reaction networks by directed hypergraphs. Often multiple pathways fit the given search criteria. To rank them, we develop an objective function based on physical arguments maximizing the probability of the pathway. We furthermore develop an automated pipeline to estimate the energy barriers of individual reactions in reaction networks. Combined, the methodology facilitates flexible and kinetically informed pathway investigations on large reaction networks by computational means, even for networks coming without kinetic annotation, such as those created via generative approaches for expanding molecular spaces.</p></details> |  |

This hampers the discovery of generalizable biomarkers, as models tend to overfit tissue-specific patterns rather than capture survival-relevant signals. To address this, we propose a Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) trained on TCGA RNA-seq data to learn representations less biased by tissue and more focused on survival. Identifying tissue-independent genetic profiles is key to revealing core cancer programs. We assess the DANN using: (1) Standard SHAP, based on the original input space and DANN's mortality classifier; (2) A layer-aware strategy applied to hidden activations, including an unsupervised manifold from raw activations and a supervised manifold from mortality-specific SHAP values. Standard SHAP remains confounded by tissue signals due to biases inherent in its computation. The raw activation manifold was dominated by high-magnitude activations, which masked subtle tissue and mortality-related signals. In contrast, the layer-aware SHAP manifold offers improved low-dimensional representations of both tissue and mortality signals, independent of activation strength, enabling subpopulation stratification and pan-cancer identification of survival-associated genes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molecular Learning Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10560v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We apply the physics-learning duality to molecular systems by complementing the physical description of interacting particles with a dual learning description, where each particle is modeled as an agent minimizing a loss function. In the traditional physics framework, the equations of motion are derived from the Lagrangian function, while in the learning framework, the same equations emerge from learning dynamics driven by the agent loss function. The loss function depends on scalar quantities that describe invariant properties of all other agents or particles. To demonstrate this approach, we first infer the loss functions of oxygen and hydrogen directly from a dataset generated by the CP2K physics-based simulation of water molecules. We then employ the loss functions to develop a learning-based simulation of water molecules, which achieves comparable accuracy while being significantly more computationally efficient than standard physics-based simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Although a target molecule can often be synthesized with multiple different reactions, it is not clear how to verify the feasibility of a reaction, because the available datasets cover only a tiny fraction of the possible solutions. Consequently, the existing models are not encouraged to explore the space of possible reactions sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel single-step retrosynthesis model, RetroGFN, that can explore outside the limited dataset and return a diverse set of feasible reactions by leveraging a feasibility proxy model during the training. We show that RetroGFN achieves competitive results on standard top-k accuracy while outperforming existing methods on round-trip accuracy. Moreover, we provide empirical arguments in favor of using round-trip accuracy, which expands the notion of feasibility with respect to the standard top-k accuracy metric.</p></details> |  |

| **[Integrated Bayesian non-parametric spatial modeling for cross-sample identification of spatially variable genes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09654v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized tissue analysis by simultaneously mapping gene expression, spatial topography, and histological context across consecutive tissue sections, enabling systematic investigation of spatial heterogeneity. The detection of spatially variable (SV) genes-molecular signatures with position-dependent expression-provides critical insights into disease mechanisms spanning oncology, neurology, and cardiovascular research. Current methodologies, however, confront dual constraints: predominant reliance on predefined spatial pattern templates restricts detection of novel complex spatial architectures, and inconsistent sample selection strategies compromise analytical stability and biological interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical framework incorporating non-parametric spatial modeling and across-sample integration. It takes advantage of the non-parametric technique and develops an adaptive spatial process accommodating complex pattern discovery. A novel cross-sample bi-level shrinkage prior is further introduced for robust multi-sample SV gene detection, facilitating more effective information fusion. An efficient variational inference is developed for posterior inference ensuring computational scalability. This architecture synergistically addresses spatial complexity through adaptive pattern learning while maintaining biological interpretability. Comprehensive simulations and empirical analyzes confirm the improved performance of the proposed method in resolving complex spatial expression patterns compared to existing analytical frameworks.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we propose a molecular grounding benchmark designed to evaluate a model's referential abilities. We align molecular grounding with established conventions in NLP, cheminformatics, and molecular science, showcasing the potential of NLP techniques to advance molecular understanding within the AI for Science movement. Furthermore, we constructed the largest molecular understanding benchmark to date, comprising 117k QA pairs, and developed a multi-agent grounding prototype as proof of concept. This system outperforms existing models, including GPT-4o, and its grounding outputs have been integrated to enhance traditional tasks such as molecular captioning and ATC (Anatomical, Therapeutic, Chemical) classification.</p></details> |  |

Existing optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) tools fail to autonomously associate molecular structures with their bioactivity profiles, creating a critical bottleneck in structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis. Here, we present BioChemInsight, an open-source pipeline that integrates: (1) DECIMER Segmentation and MolVec for chemical structure recognition, (2) Qwen2.5-VL-32B for compound identifier association, and (3) PaddleOCR with Gemini-2.0-flash for bioactivity extraction and unit normalization.

| **[Efficient Biological Data Acquisition through Inference Set Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19631v4)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In drug discovery, highly automated high-throughput laboratories are used to screen a large number of compounds in search of effective drugs. These experiments are expensive, so one might hope to reduce their cost by only experimenting on a subset of the compounds, and predicting the outcomes of the remaining experiments. In this work, we model this scenario as a sequential subset selection problem: we aim to select the smallest set of candidates in order to achieve some desired level of accuracy for the system as a whole. Our key observation is that, if there is heterogeneity in the difficulty of the prediction problem across the input space, selectively obtaining the labels for the hardest examples in the acquisition pool will leave only the relatively easy examples to remain in the inference set, leading to better overall system performance. We call this mechanism inference set design, and propose the use of a confidence-based active learning solution to prune out these challenging examples. Our algorithm includes an explicit stopping criterion that interrupts the acquisition loop when it is sufficiently confident that the system has reached the target performance. Our empirical studies on image and molecular datasets, as well as a real-world large-scale biological assay, show that active learning for inference set design leads to significant reduction in experimental cost while retaining high system performance.</p></details> |  |

While significant advances have been made in designing various conformation generation methods for small molecules and proteins, these methods struggle to generate polymer conformations due to polymers' unique structural characteristics. The scarcity of polymer conformation datasets further limits progress, making this promising area largely unexplored. In this work, we propose PolyConf, a pioneering tailored polymer conformation generation method that leverages hierarchical generative models to unlock new possibilities for this task. Specifically, we decompose the polymer conformation into a series of local conformations (i.e., the conformations of its repeating units), generating these local conformations through an autoregressive model. We then generate corresponding orientation transformations via a diffusion model to assemble these local conformations into the complete polymer conformation. Moreover, we develop the first benchmark with a high-quality polymer conformation dataset derived from molecular dynamics simulations to boost related research in this area. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PolyConf consistently generates high-quality polymer conformations, facilitating advancements in polymer modeling and simulation.</p></details> |  |

These classes are essential in obstruction theory, embedding problems, and cobordism theory. In this work, we first reestablish an appropriate notion of vector bundles in a persistent setting, allowing characteristic classes to be interpreted through topological data analysis. Next, we propose a concrete algorithm to compute persistent cohomology classes that represent the Stiefel-Whitney classes of the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold. Given a point cloud, we construct a \v{C}ech or alpha filtration. By applying the Wu formula in this setting, we derive a sequence of persistent cohomology classes from the filtration. We show that if the filtration is homotopy equivalent to a smooth manifold, then one of these persistent cohomology classes corresponds to the $k$-th Stiefel-Whitney class of the tangent bundle of that manifold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present experiments on real-world datasets, including applications to complex manifolds, image patches, and molecular conformation space.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures.

However, the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of cellular responses, combined with the extremely limited available experimental data, makes the task challenging. In this study, we leverage single-cell foundation models (FMs) pre-trained on tens of millions of single cells, encompassing multiple cell types, states, and disease annotations, to address molecular perturbation prediction. We introduce a drug-conditional adapter that allows efficient fine-tuning by training less than 1% of the original foundation model, thus enabling molecular conditioning while preserving the rich biological representation learned during pre-training. The proposed strategy allows not only the prediction of cellular responses to novel drugs, but also the zero-shot generalization to unseen cell lines. We establish a robust evaluation framework to assess model performance across different generalization tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results across all settings, with significant improvements in the few-shot and zero-shot generalization to new cell lines compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce Compositional Generative Flows (CGFlow), a novel framework that extends flow matching to generate objects in compositional steps while modeling continuous states.

We further build upon the theoretical foundations of generative flow networks (GFlowNets), enabling reward-guided sampling of compositional structures. We apply CGFlow to synthesizable drug design by jointly designing the molecule's synthetic pathway with its 3D binding pose. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art binding affinity on all 15 targets from the LIT-PCBA benchmark, and 5.8$\times$ improvement in sampling efficiency compared to 2D synthesis-based baseline.

Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets and established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with respect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most comprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the honey bee (Apis mellifera), an ecologically vital pollinator. We evaluate ApisTox using a diverse suite of machine learning approaches, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as well as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical space. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as ApisTox, demonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art algorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for more diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the agrochemical domain.</p></details> |  |

| **[Adjoint Sampling: Highly Scalable Diffusion Samplers via Adjoint Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11713v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Adjoint Sampling, a highly scalable and efficient algorithm for learning diffusion processes that sample from unnormalized densities, or energy functions. It is the first on-policy approach that allows significantly more gradient updates than the number of energy evaluations and model samples, allowing us to scale to much larger problem settings than previously explored by similar methods. Our framework is theoretically grounded in stochastic optimal control and shares the same theoretical guarantees as Adjoint Matching, being able to train without the need for corrective measures that push samples towards the target distribution. We show how to incorporate key symmetries, as well as periodic boundary conditions, for modeling molecules in both cartesian and torsional coordinates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on classical energy functions, and further scale up to neural network-based energy models where we perform amortized conformer generation across many molecular systems. To encourage further research in developing highly scalable sampling methods, we plan to open source these challenging benchmarks, where successful methods can directly impact progress in computational chemistry.</p></details> |  |

Thus, the current prevailing paradigm focuses on 3D point-cloud atom representations, utilizing graph neural network (GNN) parametrizations, with rotational symmetries baked in via E(3) invariant layers. We prove that such models must necessarily disregard chirality, a geometric property of the molecules that cannot be superimposed on their mirror image by rotation and translation. Chirality plays a key role in determining drug safety and potency. To address this glaring issue, we introduce a novel field-based representation, proposing reference rotations that replace rotational symmetry constraints. The proposed model captures all molecular geometries including chirality, while still achieving highly competitive performance with E(3)-based methods across standard benchmarking metrics.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[De Novo Generation of Hit-like Molecules from Gene Expression Profiles via Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19422v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>De novo generation of hit-like molecules is a challenging task in the drug discovery process. Most methods in previous studies learn the semantics and syntax of molecular structures by analyzing molecular graphs or simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings; however, they do not take into account the drug responses of the biological systems consisting of genes and proteins. In this study we propose a hybrid neural network, HNN2Mol, which utilizes gene expression profiles to generate molecular structures with desirable phenotypes for arbitrary target proteins. In the algorithm, a variational autoencoder is employed as a feature extractor to learn the latent feature distribution of the gene expression profiles. Then, a long short-term memory is leveraged as the chemical generator to produce syntactically valid SMILES strings that satisfy the feature conditions of the gene expression profile extracted by the feature extractor. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that the proposed HNN2Mol model can produce new molecules with potential bioactivities and drug-like properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[MADGEN: Mass-Spec attends to De Novo Molecular generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01950v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The annotation (assigning structural chemical identities) of MS/MS spectra remains a significant challenge due to the enormous molecular diversity in biological samples and the limited scope of reference databases. Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the "dark chemical space" without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Chemical Language Model Linker: blending text and molecules with modular adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20182v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models and multi-modal models has enabled the appealing idea of generating novel molecules from text descriptions. Generative modeling would shift the paradigm from relying on large-scale chemical screening to find molecules with desired properties to directly generating those molecules. However, multi-modal models combining text and molecules are often trained from scratch, without leveraging existing high-quality pretrained models. Training from scratch consumes more computational resources and prohibits model scaling. In contrast, we propose a lightweight adapter-based strategy named Chemical Language Model Linker (ChemLML). ChemLML blends the two single domain models and obtains conditional molecular generation from text descriptions while still operating in the specialized embedding spaces of the molecular domain. ChemLML can tailor diverse pretrained text models for molecule generation by training relatively few adapter parameters. We find that the choice of molecular representation used within ChemLML, SMILES versus SELFIES, has a strong influence on conditional molecular generation performance. SMILES is often preferable despite not guaranteeing valid molecules. We raise issues in using the entire PubChem dataset of molecules and their associated descriptions for evaluating molecule generation and provide a filtered version of the dataset as a generation test set. To demonstrate how ChemLML could be used in practice, we generate candidate protein inhibitors and use docking to assess their quality and also generate candidate membrane permeable molecules.</p></details> | 60 pages, 12 figures |

This work presents a computational methodology for searching for pathways in reaction networks which is based on integer linear programming and the modeling of reaction networks by directed hypergraphs. Often multiple pathways fit the given search criteria. To rank them, we develop an objective function based on physical arguments maximizing the probability of the pathway. We furthermore develop an automated pipeline to estimate the energy barriers of individual reactions in reaction networks. Combined, the methodology facilitates flexible and kinetically informed pathway investigations on large reaction networks by computational means, even for networks coming without kinetic annotation, such as those created via generative approaches for expanding molecular spaces.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models are affected by hallucination issues, resulting in errors in drug design and utilization. In this paper, we first analyze the sources of hallucination in LLMs for molecular comprehension tasks, specifically the knowledge shortcut phenomenon observed in the PubChem dataset. To evaluate hallucination in molecular comprehension tasks with computational efficiency, we introduce \textbf{Mol-Hallu}, a novel free-form evaluation metric that quantifies the degree of hallucination based on the scientific entailment relationship between generated text and actual molecular properties. Utilizing the Mol-Hallu metric, we reassess and analyze the extent of hallucination in various LLMs performing molecular comprehension tasks. Furthermore, the Hallucination Reduction Post-processing stage~(HRPP) is proposed to alleviate molecular hallucinations, Experiments show the effectiveness of HRPP on decoder-only and encoder-decoder molecular LLMs. Our findings provide critical insights into mitigating hallucination and improving the reliability of LLMs in scientific applications.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[SynFlowNet: Design of Diverse and Novel Molecules with Synthesis Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01155v3)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models see increasing use in computer-aided drug design. However, while performing well at capturing distributions of molecular motifs, they often produce synthetically inaccessible molecules. To address this, we introduce SynFlowNet, a GFlowNet model whose action space uses chemical reactions and purchasable reactants to sequentially build new molecules. By incorporating forward synthesis as an explicit constraint of the generative mechanism, we aim at bridging the gap between in silico molecular generation and real world synthesis capabilities. We evaluate our approach using synthetic accessibility scores and an independent retrosynthesis tool to assess the synthesizability of our compounds, and motivate the choice of GFlowNets through considerable improvement in sample diversity compared to baselines. Additionally, we identify challenges with reaction encodings that can complicate traversal of the MDP in the backward direction. To address this, we introduce various strategies for learning the GFlowNet backward policy and thus demonstrate how additional constraints can be integrated into the GFlowNet MDP framework. This approach enables our model to successfully identify synthesis pathways for previously unseen molecules.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniGEM: A Unified Approach to Generation and Property Prediction for Molecules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10516v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular generation and molecular property prediction are both crucial for drug discovery, but they are often developed independently. Inspired by recent studies, which demonstrate that diffusion model, a prominent generative approach, can learn meaningful data representations that enhance predictive tasks, we explore the potential for developing a unified generative model in the molecular domain that effectively addresses both molecular generation and property prediction tasks. However, the integration of these tasks is challenging due to inherent inconsistencies, making simple multi-task learning ineffective. To address this, we propose UniGEM, the first unified model to successfully integrate molecular generation and property prediction, delivering superior performance in both tasks. Our key innovation lies in a novel two-phase generative process, where predictive tasks are activated in the later stages, after the molecular scaffold is formed. We further enhance task balance through innovative training strategies. Rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in both tasks. The principles behind UniGEM hold promise for broader applications, including natural language processing and computer vision.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Unified Latent Space for 3D Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15567v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[De Novo Molecular Design Enabled by Direct Preference Optimization and Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01389v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>De novo molecular design has extensive applications in drug discovery and materials science. The vast chemical space renders direct molecular searches computationally prohibitive, while traditional experimental screening is both time- and labor-intensive. Efficient molecular generation and screening methods are therefore essential for accelerating drug discovery and reducing costs. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to optimize molecular properties via reward mechanisms, its practical utility is limited by issues in training efficiency, convergence, and stability. To address these challenges, we adopt Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) from NLP, which uses molecular score-based sample pairs to maximize the likelihood difference between high- and low-quality molecules, effectively guiding the model toward better compounds. Moreover, integrating curriculum learning further boosts training efficiency and accelerates convergence. A systematic evaluation of the proposed method on the GuacaMol Benchmark yielded excellent scores. For instance, the method achieved a score of 0.883 on the Perindopril MPO task, representing a 6\% improvement over competing models. And subsequent target protein binding experiments confirmed its practical efficacy. These results demonstrate the strong potential of DPO for molecular design tasks and highlight its effectiveness as a robust and efficient solution for data-driven drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[GENERator: A Long-Context Generative Genomic Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07272v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have significantly improved our ability to decode genomic sequences. However, the prediction and interpretation of these sequences remain challenging due to the intricate nature of genetic material. Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for biological sequence analysis. Recent developments in genomic language models have underscored the potential of LLMs in deciphering DNA sequences. Nonetheless, existing models often face limitations in robustness and application scope, primarily due to constraints in model structure and training data scale. To address these limitations, we present GENERator, a generative genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 98k base pairs (bp) and 1.2B parameters. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386B bp of eukaryotic DNA, the GENERator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both established and newly proposed benchmarks. The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology, accurately generating protein-coding sequences that translate into proteins structurally analogous to known families. It also shows significant promise in sequence optimization, particularly through the prompt-responsive generation of enhancer sequences with specific activity profiles. These capabilities position the GENERator as a pivotal tool for genomic research and biotechnological advancement, enhancing our ability to interpret and predict complex biological systems and enabling precise genomic interventions.

| **[PharMolixFM: All-Atom Foundation Models for Molecular Modeling and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21788v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structural biology relies on accurate three-dimensional biomolecular structures to advance our understanding of biological functions, disease mechanisms, and therapeutics. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of all-atom foundation models for molecular modeling and generation, existing approaches face challenges in generalization due to the multi-modal nature of atomic data and the lack of comprehensive analysis of training and sampling strategies. To address these limitations, we propose PharMolixFM, a unified framework for constructing all-atom foundation models based on multi-modal generative techniques. Our framework includes three variants using state-of-the-art multi-modal generative models. By formulating molecular tasks as a generalized denoising process with task-specific priors, PharMolixFM achieves robust performance across various structural biology applications. Experimental results demonstrate that PharMolixFM-Diff achieves competitive prediction accuracy in protein-small-molecule docking (83.9% vs. 90.2% RMSD < 2{\AA}, given pocket) with significantly improved inference speed. Moreover, we explore the empirical inference scaling law by introducing more sampling repeats or steps. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/PharMolix/OpenBioMed.</p></details> |  |
| **[GP-MoLFormer: A Foundation Model For Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04912v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models trained on large and general purpose datasets consisting of molecular strings have recently emerged as a powerful tool for successfully modeling various structure-property relations. Inspired by this success, we extend the paradigm of training chemical language transformers on large-scale chemical datasets to generative tasks in this work. Specifically, we propose GP-MoLFormer, an autoregressive molecular string generator that is trained on more than 1.1B (billion) chemical SMILES. GP-MoLFormer uses a 46.8M parameter transformer decoder model with linear attention and rotary positional encodings as the base architecture. GP-MoLFormer's utility is evaluated and compared with that of existing baselines on three different tasks: de novo generation, scaffold-constrained molecular decoration, and unconstrained property-guided optimization. While the first two are handled with no additional training, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for the last task, which uses property-ordered molecular pairs as input. We call this new approach pair-tuning. Our results show GP-MoLFormer performs better or comparable with baselines across all three tasks, demonstrating its general utility for a variety of molecular generation tasks. We further report strong memorization of training data in GP-MoLFormer generations, which has so far remained unexplored for chemical language models. Our analyses reveal that training data memorization and novelty in generations are impacted by the quality and scale of the training data; duplication bias in training data can enhance memorization at the cost of lowering novelty. We further establish a scaling law relating inference compute and novelty in generations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Make Autoregressive Great Again: Diffusion-Free Graph Generation with Next-Scale Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23612v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models are popular generative models due to their speed and properties. However, they require an explicit sequence order, which contradicts the unordered nature of graphs. In contrast, diffusion models maintain permutation invariance and enable one-shot generation but require up to thousands of denoising steps and additional features, leading to high computational costs. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in image generation-especially the success of visual autoregressive methods-we propose MAG, a novel diffusion-free graph generation framework based on next-scale prediction. By leveraging a hierarchy of latent representations, the model progressively generates scales of the entire graph without the need for explicit node ordering. Extensive experiments on both generic and molecular graph datasets demonstrate that MAG delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to three orders of magnitude in speedup during inference.</p></details> | Draft #1 |
| **[Fast Direct: Query-Efficient Online Black-box Guidance for Diffusion-model Target Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01692v5)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guided diffusion-model generation is a promising direction for customizing the generation process of a pre-trained diffusion model to address specific downstream tasks. Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/kimyong95/guide-stable-diffusion/tree/fast-direct</p></details> |  |
| **[TransDiffSBDD: Causality-Aware Multi-Modal Structure-Based Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20913v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structure-based drug design (SBDD) is a critical task in drug discovery, requiring the generation of molecular information across two distinct modalities: discrete molecular graphs and continuous 3D coordinates. However, existing SBDD methods often overlook two key challenges: (1) the multi-modal nature of this task and (2) the causal relationship between these modalities, limiting their plausibility and performance. To address both challenges, we propose TransDiffSBDD, an integrated framework combining autoregressive transformers and diffusion models for SBDD. Specifically, the autoregressive transformer models discrete molecular information, while the diffusion model samples continuous distributions, effectively resolving the first challenge. To address the second challenge, we design a hybrid-modal sequence for protein-ligand complexes that explicitly respects the causality between modalities. Experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark demonstrate that TransDiffSBDD outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Previous works in this framework often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on a subset of ZINC dataset, and by employing robust evaluation metrics we show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods for a wide range of drug design tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.09702</p></details> |

Existing generative methods are restricted to single-domain molecules, failing to address versatile therapeutic needs or utilize cross-domain transferability to enhance model performance. In this paper, we introduce Unified generative Modeling of 3D Molecules (UniMoMo), the first framework capable of designing binders of multiple molecular domains using a single model. In particular, UniMoMo unifies the representations of different molecules as graphs of blocks, where each block corresponds to either a standard amino acid or a molecular fragment. Based on these unified representations, UniMoMo utilizes a geometric latent diffusion model for 3D molecular generation, featuring an iterative full-atom autoencoder to compress blocks into latent space points, followed by an E(3)-equivariant diffusion process. Extensive benchmarks across peptides, antibodies, and small molecules demonstrate the superiority of our unified framework over existing domain-specific models, highlighting the benefits of multi-domain training.</p></details> | preprint |

While chemical Language Models (cLMs) have made strides in learning molecular properties, most fail to incorporate target-specific insights, restricting their ability to drive de-novo ligand generation. Chem42, a cutting-edge family of generative chemical Language Models, is designed to bridge this gap. By integrating atomic-level interactions with multimodal inputs from Prot42, a complementary protein Language Model, Chem42 achieves a sophisticated cross-modal representation of molecular structures, interactions, and binding patterns. This innovative framework enables the creation of structurally valid, synthetically accessible ligands with enhanced target specificity. Evaluations across diverse protein targets confirm that Chem42 surpasses existing approaches in chemical validity, target-aware design, and predicted binding affinity. By reducing the search space of viable drug candidates, Chem42 could accelerate the drug discovery pipeline, offering a powerful generative AI tool for precision medicine. Our Chem42 models set a new benchmark in molecule property prediction, conditional molecule generation, and target-aware ligand design. The models are publicly available at huggingface.co/inceptionai.</p></details> |  |
| **[Potential Score Matching: Debiasing Molecular Structure Sampling with Potential Energy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14569v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Despite their widespread occurrence, there remains a gap in modeling particle propagation through these complex structures from a molecular communication (MC) perspective. This paper introduces a generalized analytical framework for modeling diffusion-based molecular communication in multi-layered spherical environments. The framework is capable of supporting an arbitrary number of layers and flexible transmitter-receiver positioning. As an example, the detailed formulation is presented for the three-layer sphere, which is particularly relevant for different biological models such as tumor spheroids. The analytical results are validated using particle-based simulation (PBS) in scenarios that have short inter-layer distances. The findings reveal that the characteristics of each layer significantly impact molecule propagation throughout the entire structure, making their consideration crucial for designing targeted therapies and optimizing drug delivery systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; accepted to be presented in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Communication</p></details> |
| **[A Reinforcement Learning-Driven Transformer GAN for Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12796v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating molecules with desired chemical properties presents a critical challenge in fields such as chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have significantly contributed to data-driven molecular generation. However, challenges persist due to the inherent sensitivity of simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) representations and the difficulties in applying generative adversarial networks (GANs) to discrete data. This study introduces RL-MolGAN, a novel Transformer-based discrete GAN framework designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional Transformer architectures, RL-MolGAN utilizes a first-decoder-then-encoder structure, facilitating the generation of drug-like molecules from both $de~novo$ and scaffold-based designs. In addition, RL-MolGAN integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) techniques to enhance the stability of GAN training and optimize the chemical properties of the generated molecules. To further improve the model's performance, RL-MolWGAN, an extension of RL-MolGAN, incorporates Wasserstein distance and mini-batch discrimination, which together enhance the stability of the GAN. Experimental results on two widely used molecular datasets, QM9 and ZINC, validate the effectiveness of our models in generating high-quality molecular structures with diverse and desirable chemical properties.</p></details> |  |

Designed to support AI-driven drug design and discovery, M$^{3}$-20M is 71 times more in the number of molecules than the largest existing dataset, providing an unprecedented scale that can highly benefit the training or fine-tuning of models, including large language models for drug design and discovery tasks. This dataset integrates one-dimensional SMILES, two-dimensional molecular graphs, three-dimensional molecular structures, physicochemical properties, and textual descriptions collected through web crawling and generated using GPT-3.5, offering a comprehensive view of each molecule. To demonstrate the power of M$^{3}$-20M in drug design and discovery, we conduct extensive experiments on two key tasks: molecule generation and molecular property prediction, using large language models including GLM4, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama3-8b. Our experimental results show that M$^{3}$-20M can significantly boost model performance in both tasks. Specifically, it enables the models to generate more diverse and valid molecular structures and achieve higher property prediction accuracy than existing single-modal datasets, which validates the value and potential of M$^{3}$-20M in supporting AI-driven drug design and discovery.

Although their excellent performance is attributed to powerful and scalable deep neural networks, it is, at the same time, exactly the presence of these highly non-linear transformations that makes DGMs intractable. Indeed, despite representing probability distributions, intractable DGMs deny probabilistic foundations by their inability to answer even the most basic inference queries without approximations or design choices specific to a very narrow range of queries. To address this limitation, we propose probabilistic graph circuits (PGCs), a framework of tractable DGMs that provide exact and efficient probabilistic inference over (arbitrary parts of) graphs. Nonetheless, achieving both exactness and efficiency is challenging in the permutation-invariant setting of graphs. We design PGCs that are inherently invariant and satisfy these two requirements, yet at the cost of low expressive power. Therefore, we investigate two alternative strategies to achieve the invariance: the first sacrifices the efficiency, and the second sacrifices the exactness. We demonstrate that ignoring the permutation invariance can have severe consequences in anomaly detection, and that the latter approach is competitive with, and sometimes better than, existing intractable DGMs in the context of molecular graph generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pesti-Gen: Unleashing a Generative Molecule Approach for Toxicity Aware Pesticide Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14469v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global climate change has reduced crop resilience and pesticide efficacy, making reliance on synthetic pesticides inevitable, even though their widespread use poses significant health and environmental risks. While these pesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning applications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or regression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular structures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Pesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders, designed to create pesticide candidates with optimized properties for the first time. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an initial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure representation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates toxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple toxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity to generate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Notably, Pesti-Gen achieves approximately 68\% structural validity in generating new molecular structures, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in producing optimized and feasible pesticide candidates, thereby providing a new way for safer and more sustainable pest management solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the RECOMB 2025 Poster Track</p></details> |

| **[ProtTeX: Structure-In-Context Reasoning and Editing of Proteins with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08179v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have made remarkable progress in the field of molecular science, particularly in understanding and generating functional small molecules. This success is largely attributed to the effectiveness of molecular tokenization strategies. In protein science, the amino acid sequence serves as the sole tokenizer for LLMs. However, many fundamental challenges in protein science are inherently structure-dependent. The absence of structure-aware tokens significantly limits the capabilities of LLMs for comprehensive biomolecular comprehension and multimodal generation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, ProtTeX, which tokenizes the protein sequences, structures, and textual information into a unified discrete space. This innovative approach enables joint training of the LLM exclusively through the Next-Token Prediction paradigm, facilitating multimodal protein reasoning and generation. ProtTeX enables general LLMs to perceive and process protein structures through sequential text input, leverage structural information as intermediate reasoning components, and generate or manipulate structures via sequential text output. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in protein function prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art domain expert model with a twofold increase in accuracy. Our framework enables high-quality conformational generation and customizable protein design. For the first time, we demonstrate that by adopting the standard training and inference pipelines from the LLM domain, ProtTeX empowers decoder-only LLMs to effectively address diverse spectrum of protein-related tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Chemistry-Inspired Diffusion with Non-Differentiable Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06502v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in the conditional generation of novel molecules. These models can be guided in two ways: (i) explicitly, through additional features representing the condition, or (ii) implicitly, using a property predictor. However, training property predictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled data and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a novel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled datasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a non-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of relying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form of estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a conditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this results in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular structures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly reduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used for stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit guidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular properties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular optimization tasks beyond stability optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Concept-Driven Deep Learning for Enhanced Protein-Specific Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08160v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, deep learning techniques have made significant strides in molecular generation for specific targets, driving advancements in drug discovery. However, existing molecular generation methods present significant limitations: those operating at the atomic level often lack synthetic feasibility, drug-likeness, and interpretability, while fragment-based approaches frequently overlook comprehensive factors that influence protein-molecule interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel fragment-based molecular generation framework tailored for specific proteins. Our method begins by constructing a protein subpocket and molecular arm concept-based neural network, which systematically integrates interaction force information and geometric complementarity to sample molecular arms for specific protein subpockets. Subsequently, we introduce a diffusion model to generate molecular backbones that connect these arms, ensuring structural integrity and chemical diversity. Our approach significantly improves synthetic feasibility and binding affinity, with a 4% increase in drug-likeness and a 6% improvement in synthetic feasibility. Furthermore, by integrating explicit interaction data through a concept-based model, our framework enhances interpretability, offering valuable insights into the molecular design process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Molecular Graphs and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03135v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional generalization capabilities, their ability to process graph data, such as molecular structures, remains limited. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Graph2Token, an efficient solution that aligns graph tokens to LLM tokens. The key idea is to represent a graph token with the LLM token vocabulary, without fine-tuning the LLM backbone. To achieve this goal, we first construct a molecule-text paired dataset from multisources, including CHEBI and HMDB, to train a graph structure encoder, which reduces the distance between graphs and texts representations in the feature space. Then, we propose a novel alignment strategy that associates a graph token with LLM tokens. To further unleash the potential of LLMs, we collect molecular IUPAC name identifiers, which are incorporated into the LLM prompts. By aligning molecular graphs as special tokens, we can activate LLM generalization ability to molecular few-shot learning. Extensive experiments on molecular classification and regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Graph2Token.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 camera ready version</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of manual annotation for biochemical properties, the performance for molecule generation tasks is still limited, especially for tasks involving multi-properties constraints. In this work, we present a two-step framework PEIT (Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning) to improve LLMs for molecular-related tasks. In the first step, we use textual descriptions, SMILES, and biochemical properties as multimodal inputs to pre-train a model called PEIT-GEN, by aligning multi-modal representations to synthesize instruction data. In the second step, we fine-tune existing open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the resulting PEIT-LLM can handle molecule captioning, text-based molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and our newly proposed multi-constraint molecule generation tasks. Experimental results show that our pre-trained PEIT-GEN outperforms MolT5 and BioT5 in molecule captioning, demonstrating modalities align well between textual descriptions, structures, and biochemical properties. Furthermore, PEIT-LLM shows promising improvements in multi-task molecule generation, proving the scalability of the PEIT framework for various molecular tasks. We release the code, constructed instruction data, and model checkpoints in https://github.com/chenlong164/PEIT.</p></details> | 9 |
| **[Learning-Order Autoregressive Models with Application to Molecular Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05979v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models (ARMs) have become the workhorse for sequence generation tasks, since many problems can be modeled as next-token prediction. While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an \emph{order-policy}, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the exact log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation. On the challenging domain of molecular graph generation, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k benchmarks, evaluated using the Fr\'{e}chet ChemNet Distance (FCD).</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on trial-and-error, while recent deep learning approaches have accelerated molecular generation. However, existing models struggle with generating molecules based on specific textual descriptions. We introduce Mol-CADiff, a novel diffusion-based framework that uses causal attention mechanisms for text-conditional molecular generation. Our approach explicitly models the causal relationship between textual prompts and molecular structures, overcoming key limitations in existing methods. We enhance dependency modeling both within and across modalities, enabling precise control over the generation process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Mol-CADiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating diverse, novel, and chemically valid molecules, with better alignment to specified properties, enabling more intuitive language-driven molecular design.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a Python-based algorithm that automates the generation of reaction templates for the LAMMPS REACTION package, leveraging graph-theoretical principles and sub-graph isomorphism techniques. By representing molecular systems as mathematical graphs, the method enables automated identification of conserved molecular domains, reaction sites, and atom mappings, significantly reducing manual effort. The algorithm was validated on three case studies: poly-addition, poly-condensation, and chain polymerization, demonstrating its ability to map conserved regions, identify reaction-initiating atoms, and resolve challenges such as symmetric reactants and indistinguishable atoms. Additionally, the generated templates were optimized for computational efficiency by retaining only essential reactive domains, ensuring scalability and consistency in high-throughput workflows for computational chemistry, materials science, and machine learning applications. Future work will focus on extending the method to mixed organic-inorganic systems, incorporating adaptive scoring mechanisms, and integrating quantum mechanical calculations to enhance its applicability.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we introduce a novel Straight-Line Diffusion Model (SLDM) to tackle this problem, by formulating the diffusion process to follow a linear trajectory. The proposed process aligns well with the noise sensitivity characteristic of molecular structures and uniformly distributes reconstruction effort across the generative process, thus enhancing learning efficiency and efficacy. Consequently, SLDM achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D molecule generation benchmarks, delivering a 100-fold improvement in sampling efficiency. Furthermore, experiments on toy data and image generation tasks validate the generality and robustness of SLDM, showcasing its potential across diverse generative modeling domains.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we have developed P2DFlow, a generative model based on SE(3) flow matching, to predict the structural ensembles of proteins. We specifically designed a valuable prior for the flow process and enhanced the model's ability to distinguish each intermediate state by incorporating an additional dimension to describe the ensemble data, which can reflect the physical laws governing the distribution of ensembles, so that the prior knowledge can effectively guide the generation process. When trained and evaluated on the MD datasets of ATLAS, P2DFlow outperforms other baseline models on extensive experiments, successfully capturing the observable dynamic fluctuations as evidenced in crystal structure and MD simulations. As a potential proxy agent for protein molecular simulation, the high-quality ensembles generated by P2DFlow could significantly aid in understanding protein functions across various scenarios.

Some gradient-free guidance methods have been developed, but they often struggle to achieve optimal inference-time alignment. In this work, we newly frame inference-time alignment in diffusion as a search problem and propose Dynamic Search for Diffusion (DSearch), which subsamples from denoising processes and approximates intermediate node rewards. It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in atom- and motif-wise deep learning models for 3D molecular generation, current methods often struggle with validity and reliability. To address these issues, we develop the Atom-Motif Consistency Diffusion Model (AMDiff), utilizing a joint-training paradigm for multi-view learning. This model features a hierarchical diffusion architecture that integrates both atom- and motif-level views of molecules, allowing for comprehensive exploration of complementary information. By leveraging classifier-free guidance and incorporating binding site features as conditional inputs, AMDiff ensures robust molecule generation across diverse targets. Compared to existing approaches, AMDiff exhibits superior validity and novelty in generating molecules tailored to fit various protein pockets. Case studies targeting protein kinases, including Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) and Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), demonstrate the model's capability in structure-based de novo drug design. Overall, AMDiff bridges the gap between atom-view and motif-view drug discovery and speeds up the process of target-aware molecular generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

SymDiff resembles a learned data augmentation that is deployed at sampling time, and is lightweight, computationally efficient, and easy to implement on top of arbitrary off-the-shelf models. In contrast to previous work, SymDiff typically does not require any neural network components that are intrinsically equivariant, avoiding the need for complex parameterisations or the use of higher-order geometric features. Instead, our method can leverage highly scalable modern architectures as drop-in replacements for these more constrained alternatives. We show that this additional flexibility yields significant empirical benefit for $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariant molecular generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of symmetrisation to generative modelling, suggesting its potential in this domain more generally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods fall into PC-Free and PC-Aware categories based on their use of 3D point clouds (PC). PC-Free models prioritize diversity but suffer from lower validity due to overlooking PC constraints, while PC-Aware models ensure higher validity but restrict diversity by enforcing strict PC constraints. To overcome these trade-offs without additional training, we propose HybridLinker, a framework that enhances PC-Aware inference by providing diverse bonding topologies from a pretrained PC-Free model as guidance. At its core, we propose LinkerDPS, the first diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) method operating across PC-Free and PC-Aware spaces, bridging molecular topology with 3D point clouds via an energy-inspired function. By transferring the diverse sampling distribution of PC-Free models into the PC-Aware distribution, HybridLinker significantly and consistently surpasses baselines, improving both validity and diversity in foundational molecular design and applied property optimization tasks, establishing a new DPS framework in the molecular and graph domains beyond imaging.</p></details> |  |

The use of graph autoencoders - with both encoder and decoder implemented as message passing networks - is intriguing due to their ability to generate permutation-invariant graph representations. However, this approach faces difficulties because decoding a graph structure from a single vector is challenging, and comparing input and output graphs requires an effective permutation-invariant similarity measure. As a result, many studies rely on approximate methods. In this work, we explore the effect of graph matching precision on the training behavior and generation capabilities of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we propose a transformer-based message passing graph decoder as an alternative to a graph neural network decoder, that is more robust and expressive by leveraging global attention mechanisms. (2) We show that the precision of graph matching has significant impact on training behavior and is essential for effective de novo (molecular) graph generation.

We further introduce an unconditional 3D molecular generation model, SemlaFlow, which is trained using equivariant flow matching to generate a joint distribution over atom types, coordinates, bond types and formal charges. Our model produces state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with as few as 20 sampling steps, corresponding to a two order-of-magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight limitations of current evaluation methods for 3D generation and propose new benchmark metrics for unconditional molecular generators.

Language models and graph-based models are extensively utilized within this domain, consistently achieving state-of-the-art results across an array of tasks. However, the prevailing practice of representing chemical compounds in the SMILES format -- used by most datasets and many language models -- presents notable limitations as a training data format. In contrast, chemical fingerprints offer a more physically informed representation of compounds, thereby enhancing their suitability for model training. This study aims to develop a language model that is specifically trained on fingerprints. Furthermore, we introduce a bimodal architecture that integrates this language model with a graph model. Our proposed methodology synthesizes these approaches, utilizing RoBERTa as the language model and employing Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graphormer as graph models. This integration results in a significant improvement in predictive performance compared to conventional strategies for tasks such as Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) and the prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, among others.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, retrieval-augmented generation has become a principled approach commonly used with language models. However, the optimal integration of retrieval augmentation into molecular machine learning remains unclear. Graph neural networks stand to benefit from clever matching to understand the structural alignment of retrieved molecules to a query molecule. Neural graph matching offers a compelling solution by explicitly modeling node and edge affinities between two structural graphs while employing a noise-robust, end-to-end neural network to learn affinity metrics. We apply this approach to mass spectrum simulation and introduce MARASON, a novel model that incorporates neural graph matching to enhance a fragmentation-based neural network. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our design, with MARASON achieving 28% top-1 accuracy, a substantial improvement over the non-retrieval state-of-the-art accuracy of 19%.

Traditional generative models often struggle with limited training data, particularly in drug discovery, where molecular datasets for specific therapeutic targets, such as nucleic acids binders and central nervous system (CNS) drugs, are scarce. ADSeqGAN addresses this challenge by integrating an auxiliary random forest classifier as an additional discriminator into the GAN framework, significantly improves molecular generation quality and class specificity. Our method incorporates pretrained generator and Wasserstein distance to enhance training stability and diversity. We evaluate ADSeqGAN on a dataset comprising nucleic acid-targeting and protein-targeting small molecules, demonstrating its superior ability to generate nucleic acid binders compared to baseline models such as SeqGAN, ORGAN, and MolGPT. Through an oversampling strategy, ADSeqGAN also significantly improves CNS drug generation, achieving a higher yield than traditional de novo models. Critical assessments, including docking simulations and molecular property analysis, confirm that ADSeqGAN-generated molecules exhibit strong binding affinities, enhanced chemical diversity, and improved synthetic feasibility. Overall, ADSeqGAN presents a novel framework for generative molecular design in data-scarce scenarios, offering potential applications in computational drug discovery.

While supervised learning methods generate high-quality molecules similar to those in a dataset, they struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution properties. Reinforcement learning can explore new chemical spaces but often conducts 'reward-hacking' and generates non-synthesizable molecules. In this work, we address this problem by integrating a state-of-the-art supervised learning method, STGG+, in an active learning loop. Our approach iteratively generates, evaluates, and fine-tunes STGG+ to continuously expand its knowledge. We denote this approach STGG+AL. We apply STGG+AL to the design of organic $\pi$-functional materials, specifically two challenging tasks: 1) generating highly absorptive molecules characterized by high oscillator strength and 2) designing absorptive molecules with reasonable oscillator strength in the near-infrared (NIR) range. The generated molecules are validated and rationalized in-silico with time-dependent density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that our method is highly effective in generating novel molecules with high oscillator strength, contrary to existing methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) methods.

| **[UniMatch: Universal Matching from Atom to Task for Few-Shot Drug Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12453v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is crucial for identifying candidate drugs for various diseases.However, its low success rate often results in a scarcity of annotations, posing a few-shot learning problem. Existing methods primarily focus on single-scale features, overlooking the hierarchical molecular structures that determine different molecular properties. To address these issues, we introduce Universal Matching Networks (UniMatch), a dual matching framework that integrates explicit hierarchical molecular matching with implicit task-level matching via meta-learning, bridging multi-level molecular representations and task-level generalization. Specifically, our approach explicitly captures structural features across multiple levels, such as atoms, substructures, and molecules, via hierarchical pooling and matching, facilitating precise molecular representation and comparison. Additionally, we employ a meta-learning strategy for implicit task-level matching, allowing the model to capture shared patterns across tasks and quickly adapt to new ones. This unified matching framework ensures effective molecular alignment while leveraging shared meta-knowledge for fast adaptation. Our experimental results demonstrate that UniMatch outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the MoleculeNet and FS-Mol benchmarks, achieving improvements of 2.87% in AUROC and 6.52% in delta AUPRC. UniMatch also shows excellent generalization ability on the Meta-MolNet benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as ICLR 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Diverse Molecules? Towards Alignment with Structural Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03138v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in molecular generation, which offers potential to accelerate drug discovery. However, the current LLMs overlook a critical requirement for drug discovery: proposing a diverse set of molecules. This diversity is essential for improving the chances of finding a viable drug, as it provides alternative molecules that may succeed where others fail in real-world validations. Nevertheless, the LLMs often output structurally similar molecules. While decoding schemes like diverse beam search may enhance textual diversity, this often does not align with molecular structural diversity. In response, we propose a new method for fine-tuning molecular generative LLMs to autoregressively generate a set of structurally diverse molecules, where each molecule is generated by conditioning on the previously generated molecules. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) supervised fine-tuning to adapt LLMs to autoregressively generate molecules in a sequence and (2) reinforcement learning to maximize structural diversity within the generated molecules. Our experiments show that the proposed approach enables LLMs to generate diverse molecules better than existing approaches for diverse sequence generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MING: A Functional Approach to Learning Molecular Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12522v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional molecule generation methods often rely on sequence- or graph-based representations, which can limit their expressive power or require complex permutation-equivariant architectures. This paper introduces a novel paradigm for learning molecule generative models based on functional representations. Specifically, we propose Molecular Implicit Neural Generation (MING), a diffusion-based model that learns molecular distributions in the function space. Unlike standard diffusion processes in the data space, MING employs a novel functional denoising probabilistic process, which jointly denoises information in both the function's input and output spaces by leveraging an expectation-maximization procedure for latent implicit neural representations of data. This approach enables a simple yet effective model design that accurately captures underlying function distributions. Experimental results on molecule-related datasets demonstrate MING's superior performance and ability to generate plausible molecular samples, surpassing state-of-the-art data-space methods while offering a more streamlined architecture and significantly faster generation times. The code is available at https://github.com/v18nguye/MING.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |
| **[Conformal Generative Modeling with Improved Sample Efficiency through Sequential Greedy Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01660v2)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models lack rigorous statistical guarantees for their outputs and are therefore unreliable in safety-critical applications. In this work, we propose Sequential Conformal Prediction for Generative Models (SCOPE-Gen), a sequential conformal prediction method producing prediction sets that satisfy a rigorous statistical guarantee called conformal admissibility control. This guarantee states that with high probability, the prediction sets contain at least one admissible (or valid) example. To this end, our method first samples an initial set of i.i.d. examples from a black box generative model. Then, this set is iteratively pruned via so-called greedy filters. As a consequence of the iterative generation procedure, admissibility of the final prediction set factorizes as a Markov chain. This factorization is crucial, because it allows to control each factor separately, using conformal prediction. In comparison to prior work, our method demonstrates a large reduction in the number of admissibility evaluations during calibration. This reduction is important in safety-critical applications, where these evaluations must be conducted manually by domain experts and are therefore costly and time consuming. We highlight the advantages of our method in terms of admissibility evaluations and cardinality of the prediction sets through experiments in natural language generation and molecular graph extension tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MassSpecGym: A benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23326v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery and identification of molecules in biological and environmental samples is crucial for advancing biomedical and chemical sciences. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the leading technique for high-throughput elucidation of molecular structures. However, decoding a molecular structure from its mass spectrum is exceptionally challenging, even when performed by human experts. As a result, the vast majority of acquired MS/MS spectra remain uninterpreted, thereby limiting our understanding of the underlying (bio)chemical processes. Despite decades of progress in machine learning applications for predicting molecular structures from MS/MS spectra, the development of new methods is severely hindered by the lack of standard datasets and evaluation protocols. To address this problem, we propose MassSpecGym -- the first comprehensive benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules from MS/MS data. Our benchmark comprises the largest publicly available collection of high-quality labeled MS/MS spectra and defines three MS/MS annotation challenges: de novo molecular structure generation, molecule retrieval, and spectrum simulation. It includes new evaluation metrics and a generalization-demanding data split, therefore standardizing the MS/MS annotation tasks and rendering the problem accessible to the broad machine learning community. MassSpecGym is publicly available at https://github.com/pluskal-lab/MassSpecGym.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmetry-Preserving Diffusion Models via Target Symmetrization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09890v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are powerful tools for capturing complex distributions, but modeling data with inherent symmetries, such as molecular structures, remains challenging. Equivariant denoisers are commonly used to address this, but they introduce architectural complexity and optimization challenges, including noisy gradients and convergence issues. We propose a novel approach that enforces equivariance through a symmetrized loss function, which applies a time-dependent weighted averaging operation over group actions to the model's prediction target. This ensures equivariance without explicit architectural constraints and reduces gradient variance, leading to more stable and efficient optimization. Our method uses Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the average, incurring minimal computational overhead. We provide theoretical guarantees of equivariance for the minimizer of our loss function and demonstrate its effectiveness on synthetic datasets and the molecular conformation generation task using the GEOM-QM9 dataset. Experiments show improved sample quality compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of our approach to enhance the scalability and practicality of equivariant diffusion models in generative tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffMS: Diffusion Generation of Molecules Conditioned on Mass Spectra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09571v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mass spectrometry plays a fundamental role in elucidating the structures of unknown molecules and subsequent scientific discoveries. One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional $\textit{de novo}$ generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on $\textit{de novo}$ molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size. DiffMS code is publicly available at https://github.com/coleygroup/DiffMS.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Diffusion Models for Molecules: A Survey of Methods and Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09511v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative tasks about molecules, including but not limited to molecule generation, are crucial for drug discovery and material design, and have consistently attracted significant attention. In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as an impressive class of deep generative models, sparking extensive research and leading to numerous studies on their application to molecular generative tasks. Despite the proliferation of related work, there remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this area. Particularly, due to the diversity of diffusion model formulations, molecular data modalities, and generative task types, the research landscape is challenging to navigate, hindering understanding and limiting the area's growth. To address this, this paper conducts a comprehensive survey of diffusion model-based molecular generative methods. We systematically review the research from the perspectives of methodological formulations, data modalities, and task types, offering a novel taxonomy. This survey aims to facilitate understanding and further flourishing development in this area.

| **[Enhancing Diffusion Models Efficiency by Disentangling Total-Variance and Signal-to-Noise Ratio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08598v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long sampling time of diffusion models remains a significant bottleneck, which can be mitigated by reducing the number of diffusion time steps. However, the quality of samples with fewer steps is highly dependent on the noise schedule, i.e., the specific manner in which noise is introduced and the signal is reduced at each step. Although prior work has improved upon the original variance-preserving and variance-exploding schedules, these approaches $\textit{passively}$ adjust the total variance, without direct control over it. In this work, we propose a novel total-variance/signal-to-noise-ratio disentangled (TV/SNR) framework, where TV and SNR can be controlled independently. Our approach reveals that different existing schedules, where the TV explodes exponentially, can be $\textit{improved}$ by setting a constant TV schedule while preserving the same SNR schedule. Furthermore, generalizing the SNR schedule of the optimal transport flow matching significantly improves the performance in molecular structure generation, achieving few step generation of stable molecules. A similar tendency is observed in image generation, where our approach with a uniform diffusion time grid performs comparably to the highly tailored EDM sampler.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Representation Condition Improves Equivariant Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03655v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in molecular generative models have demonstrated substantial potential in accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often face challenges in generating high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to enhance the performance of molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the molecule generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared to directly generating a molecule, the relatively easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second-stage generation to reach a high-quality molecule in a more goal-oriented and much faster way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as the base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation tasks on the widely-used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 31\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations over conditioning on individual property values as in previous approaches. Furthermore, we show that, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly accelerating the generation process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation of Molecules via Algebraic Data Types : Advancing Beyond SMILES & SELFIES](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13633v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel molecular representation through Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) - composite data structures formed through the combination of simpler types that obey algebraic laws. By explicitly considering how the datatype of a representation constrains the operations which may be performed, we ensure meaningful inference can be performed over generative models (programs with sample} and score operations). This stands in contrast to string-based representations where string-type operations may only indirectly correspond to chemical and physical molecular properties, and at worst produce nonsensical output. The ADT presented implements the Dietz representation for molecular constitution via multigraphs and bonding systems, and uses atomic coordinate data to represent 3D information and stereochemical features. This creates a general digital molecular representation which surpasses the limitations of the string-based representations and the 2D-graph based models on which they are based. In addition, we present novel support for quantum information through representation of shells, subshells, and orbitals, greatly expanding the representational scope beyond current approaches, for instance in Molecular Orbital theory. The framework's capabilities are demonstrated through key applications: Bayesian probabilistic programming is demonstrated through integration with LazyPPL, a lazy probabilistic programming library; molecules are made instances of a group under rotation, necessary for geometric learning techniques which exploit the invariance of molecular properties under different representations; and the framework's flexibility is demonstrated through an extension to model chemical reactions. After critiquing previous representations, we provide an open-source solution in Haskell - a type-safe, purely functional programming language.</p></details> | 1 Figure |
| **[Representational Alignment with Chemical Induced Fit for Molecular Relational Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07027v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) is widely applied in natural sciences to predict relationships between molecular pairs by extracting structural features. The representational similarity between substructure pairs determines the functional compatibility of molecular binding sites. Nevertheless, aligning substructure representations by attention mechanisms lacks guidance from chemical knowledge, resulting in unstable model performance in chemical space (\textit{e.g.}, functional group, scaffold) shifted data. With theoretical justification, we propose the \textbf{Re}presentational \textbf{Align}ment with Chemical Induced \textbf{Fit} (ReAlignFit) to enhance the stability of MRL. ReAlignFit dynamically aligns substructure representation in MRL by introducing chemical Induced Fit-based inductive bias. In the induction process, we design the Bias Correction Function based on substructure edge reconstruction to align representations between substructure pairs by simulating chemical conformational changes (dynamic combination of substructures). ReAlignFit further integrates the Subgraph Information Bottleneck during fit process to refine and optimize substructure pairs exhibiting high chemical functional compatibility, leveraging them to generate molecular embeddings. Experimental results on nine datasets demonstrate that ReAlignFit outperforms state-of-the-art models in two tasks and significantly enhances model's stability in both rule-shifted and scaffold-shifted data distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOG-Diff: Higher-Order Guided Diffusion for Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04308v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph generation is a critical yet challenging task as empirical analyses require a deep understanding of complex, non-Euclidean structures. Although diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, these models typically adapt from the frameworks designed for image generation, making them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose a novel Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff) model that follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum and is guided by higher-order information, enabling the progressive generation of plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiminghh/HOG-Diff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mol-LLM: Generalist Molecular LLM with Improved Graph Utilization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02810v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have motivated the development of general LLMs for molecular tasks. While several studies have demonstrated that fine-tuned LLMs can achieve impressive benchmark performances, they are far from genuine generalist molecular LLMs due to a lack of fundamental understanding of molecular structure. Specifically, when given molecular task instructions, LLMs trained with naive next-token prediction training assign similar likelihood scores to both original and negatively corrupted molecules, revealing their lack of molecular structure understanding that is crucial for reliable and general molecular LLMs. To overcome this limitation and obtain a true generalist molecular LLM, we introduce a novel multi-modal training method based on a thorough multi-modal instruction tuning as well as a molecular structure preference optimization between chosen and rejected graphs. On various molecular benchmarks, the proposed generalist molecular LLM, called Mol-LLM, achieves state-of-the-art performances among generalist LLMs on most tasks, at the same time, surpassing or comparable to state-of-the-art specialist LLMs. Moreover, Mol-LLM also shows superior generalization performances in reaction prediction tasks, demonstrating the effect of the molecular structure understanding for generalization perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling on Lie Groups via Euclidean Generalized Score Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02513v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We extend Euclidean score-based diffusion processes to generative modeling on Lie groups. Through the formalism of Generalized Score Matching, our approach yields a Langevin dynamics which decomposes as a direct sum of Lie algebra representations, enabling generative processes on Lie groups while operating in Euclidean space. Unlike equivariant models, which restrict the space of learnable functions by quotienting out group orbits, our method can model any target distribution on any (non-Abelian) Lie group. Standard score matching emerges as a special case of our framework when the Lie group is the translation group. We prove that our generalized generative processes arise as solutions to a new class of paired stochastic differential equations (SDEs), introduced here for the first time. We validate our approach through experiments on diverse data types, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications such as SO(3)-guided molecular conformer generation and modeling ligand-specific global SE(3) transformations for molecular docking, showing improvement in comparison to Riemannian diffusion on the group itself. We show that an appropriate choice of Lie group enhances learning efficiency by reducing the effective dimensionality of the trajectory space and enables the modeling of transitions between complex data distributions. Additionally, we demonstrate the universality of our approach by deriving how it extends to flow matching.</p></details> | 27 pages |

At the core of our approach is a reversible "flattening" process that transforms graphs into random sequences. By sampling and learning from these sequences, AutoGraph enables transformers to model and generate complex graph structures in a manner akin to natural language. In contrast to diffusion models that rely on computationally intensive node features, our approach operates exclusively on these sequences. The sampling complexity and sequence length scale linearly with the number of edges, making AutoGraph highly scalable for generating large sparse graphs. Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse synthetic and molecular graph generation benchmarks, while delivering a 100-fold generation and a 3-fold training speedup compared to leading diffusion models. Additionally, it demonstrates promising transfer capabilities and supports substructure-conditioned generation without additional fine-tuning. By extending language modeling techniques to graph generation, this work paves the way for developing graph foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Docking-Aware Attention: Dynamic Protein Representations through Molecular Context Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01461v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational prediction of enzymatic reactions represents a crucial challenge in sustainable chemical synthesis across various scientific domains, ranging from drug discovery to materials science and green chemistry. These syntheses rely on proteins that selectively catalyze complex molecular transformations. These protein catalysts exhibit remarkable substrate adaptability, with the same protein often catalyzing different chemical transformations depending on its molecular partners. Current approaches to protein representation in reaction prediction either ignore protein structure entirely or rely on static embeddings, failing to capture how proteins dynamically adapt their behavior to different substrates. We present Docking-Aware Attention (DAA), a novel architecture that generates dynamic, context-dependent protein representations by incorporating molecular docking information into the attention mechanism. DAA combines physical interaction scores from docking predictions with learned attention patterns to focus on protein regions most relevant to specific molecular interactions. We evaluate our method on enzymatic reaction prediction, where it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 62.2\% accuracy versus 56.79\% on complex molecules and 55.54\% versus 49.45\% on innovative reactions. Through detailed ablation studies and visualizations, we demonstrate how DAA generates interpretable attention patterns that adapt to different molecular contexts. Our approach represents a general framework for context-aware protein representation in biocatalysis prediction, with potential applications across enzymatic synthesis planning. We open-source our implementation and pre-trained models to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable Boltzmann Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14426v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of equilibrium samples of molecular systems has been a long-standing problem in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators are a generative machine learning method that addresses this issue by learning a transformation via a normalizing flow from a simple prior distribution to the target Boltzmann distribution of interest. Recently, flow matching has been employed to train Boltzmann Generators for small molecular systems in Cartesian coordinates. We extend this work and propose a first framework for Boltzmann Generators that are transferable across chemical space, such that they predict zero-shot Boltzmann distributions for test molecules without being retrained for these systems. These transferable Boltzmann Generators allow approximate sampling from the target distribution of unseen systems, as well as efficient reweighting to the target Boltzmann distribution. The transferability of the proposed framework is evaluated on dipeptides, where we show that it generalizes efficiently to unseen systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed architecture enhances the efficiency of Boltzmann Generators trained on single molecular systems.</p></details> |  |

Here we introduce the QMe14S dataset, comprising 186,102 small organic molecules featuring 14 elements (H, B, C, N, O, F, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, As, Se, Br) and 47 functional groups. Using density functional theory at the B3LYP/TZVP level, we optimized the geometries and calculated properties including energy, atomic charge, atomic force, dipole moment, quadrupole moment, polarizability, octupole moment, first hyperpolarizability, and Hessian. At the same level, we obtained the harmonic IR, Raman and NMR spectra. Furthermore, we conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to generate dynamic configurations and extract nonequilibrium properties, including energy, forces, and Hessians. By leveraging our E(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network (DetaNet), we demonstrated that models trained on QMe14S outperform those trained on the previously developed QM9S dataset in simulating molecular spectra. The QMe14S dataset thus serves as a comprehensive benchmark for molecular simulations, offering valuable insights into structure-property relationships.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4figures |

Despite their strong predictive capabilities, these models lack a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty, which is key in scientific applications such as PDE solving, molecular generation and Machine Learning Force Fields. To address this shortcoming we present BARNN: a variational Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network. BARNNs aim to provide a principled way to turn any autoregressive or recurrent model into its Bayesian version. BARNN is based on the variational dropout method, allowing to apply it to large recurrent neural networks as well. We also introduce a temporal version of the "Variational Mixtures of Posteriors" prior (tVAMP-prior) to make Bayesian inference efficient and well-calibrated. Extensive experiments on PDE modelling and molecular generation demonstrate that BARNN not only achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, but also excels in uncertainty quantification and modelling long-range dependencies.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for chemicals. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Discrete Denoising Diffusion Model for Molecular Generation with OpenFL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12523v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating unique molecules with biochemically desired properties to serve as viable drug candidates is a difficult task that requires specialized domain expertise. In recent years, diffusion models have shown promising results in accelerating the drug design process through AI-driven molecular generation. However, training these models requires massive amounts of data, which are often isolated in proprietary silos. OpenFL is a federated learning framework that enables privacy-preserving collaborative training across these decentralized data sites. In this work, we present a federated discrete denoising diffusion model that was trained using OpenFL. The federated model achieves comparable performance with a model trained on centralized data when evaluating the uniqueness and validity of the generated molecules. This demonstrates the utility of federated learning in the drug design process. OpenFL is available at: https://github.com/securefederatedai/openfl</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Learning to generate feasible graphs using graph grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06003v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative methods for graphs need to be sufficiently flexible to model complex dependencies between sets of nodes. At the same time, the generated graphs need to satisfy domain-dependent feasibility conditions, that is, they should not violate certain constraints that would make their interpretation impossible within the given application domain (e.g. a molecular graph where an atom has a very large number of chemical bounds). Crucially, constraints can involve not only local but also long-range dependencies: for example, the maximal length of a cycle can be bounded. Currently, a large class of generative approaches for graphs, such as methods based on artificial neural networks, is based on message passing schemes. These approaches suffer from information 'dilution' issues that severely limit the maximal range of the dependencies that can be modeled. To address this problem, we propose a generative approach based on the notion of graph grammars. The key novel idea is to introduce a domain-dependent coarsening procedure to provide short-cuts for long-range dependencies. We show the effectiveness of our proposal in two domains: 1) small drugs and 2) RNA secondary structures. In the first case, we compare the quality of the generated molecular graphs via the Molecular Sets (MOSES) benchmark suite, which evaluates the distance between generated and real molecules, their lipophilicity, synthesizability, and drug-likeness. In the second case, we show that the approach can generate very large graphs (with hundreds of nodes) that are accepted as valid examples for a desired RNA family by the "Infernal" covariance model, a state-of-the-art RNA classifier. Our implementation is available on github: github.com/fabriziocosta/GraphLearn</p></details> |  |

MOFA addresses key challenges in integrating GPU-accelerated computing for GPU-intensive GenAI tasks, including distributed training and inference, alongside CPU- and GPU-optimized tasks for screening and filtering AI-generated MOFs using molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and Monte Carlo simulations. These heterogeneous tasks are unified within an online learning framework that optimizes the utilization of available CPU and GPU resources across HPC systems. Performance metrics from a 450-node (14,400 AMD Zen 3 CPUs + 1800 NVIDIA A100 GPUs) supercomputer run demonstrate that MOFA achieves high-throughput generation of novel MOF structures, with CO$_2$ adsorption capacities ranking among the top 10 in the hypothetical MOF (hMOF) dataset. Furthermore, the production of high-quality MOFs exhibits a linear relationship with the number of nodes utilized. The modular architecture of MOFA will facilitate its integration into other scientific applications that dynamically combine GenAI with large-scale simulations.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

Leading contrastive learning works show two kinds of view generators, that is, random or learnable data corruption and domain knowledge incorporation. While effective, the two ways also lead to molecular semantics altering and limited generalization capability, respectively. To this end, we relate the \textbf{L}in\textbf{E} graph with \textbf{MO}lecular graph co\textbf{N}trastive learning and propose a novel method termed \textit{LEMON}. Specifically, by contrasting the given graph with the corresponding line graph, the graph encoder can freely encode the molecular semantics without omission. Furthermore, we present a new patch with edge attribute fusion and two local contrastive losses enhance information transmission and tackle hard negative samples. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for view generation, superior performance on molecular property prediction suggests the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based 3D molecule generation with neural fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08508v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new representation for 3D molecules based on their continuous atomic density fields. Using this representation, we propose a new model based on walk-jump sampling for unconditional 3D molecule generation in the continuous space using neural fields. Our model, FuncMol, encodes molecular fields into latent codes using a conditional neural field, samples noisy codes from a Gaussian-smoothed distribution with Langevin MCMC (walk), denoises these samples in a single step (jump), and finally decodes them into molecular fields. FuncMol performs all-atom generation of 3D molecules without assumptions on the molecular structure and scales well with the size of molecules, unlike most approaches. Our method achieves competitive results on drug-like molecules and easily scales to macro-cyclic peptides, with at least one order of magnitude faster sampling.

| **[GDiffRetro: Retrosynthesis Prediction with Dual Graph Enhanced Molecular Representation and Diffusion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08001v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrosynthesis prediction focuses on identifying reactants capable of synthesizing a target product. Typically, the retrosynthesis prediction involves two phases: Reaction Center Identification and Reactant Generation. However, we argue that most existing methods suffer from two limitations in the two phases: (i) Existing models do not adequately capture the ``face'' information in molecular graphs for the reaction center identification. (ii) Current approaches for the reactant generation predominantly use sequence generation in a 2D space, which lacks versatility in generating reasonable distributions for completed reactive groups and overlooks molecules' inherent 3D properties. To overcome the above limitations, we propose GDiffRetro. For the reaction center identification, GDiffRetro uniquely integrates the original graph with its corresponding dual graph to represent molecular structures, which helps guide the model to focus more on the faces in the graph. For the reactant generation, GDiffRetro employs a conditional diffusion model in 3D to further transform the obtained synthon into a complete reactant. Our experimental findings reveal that GDiffRetro outperforms state-of-the-art semi-template models across various evaluative metrics.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant progress in generative models, accurately generating complex and biologically or material-relevant molecular structures remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model for three-dimensional (3D) molecule generation that combines a classifiable diffusion model, Diffusion Transformer, with multihead equivariant self-attention. This method addresses two key challenges: correctly attaching hydrogen atoms in generated molecules through learning representations of molecules after hydrogen atoms are removed; and overcoming the limitations of existing models that cannot generate molecules across multiple classes simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that our model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across several key metrics but also exhibits robustness and versatility, making it highly suitable for early-stage large-scale generation processes in molecular design, followed by validation and further screening to obtain molecules with specific properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenMol: A Drug Discovery Generalist with Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06158v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is a complex process that involves multiple scenarios and stages, such as fragment-constrained molecule generation, hit generation and lead optimization. However, existing molecular generative models can only tackle one or two of these scenarios and lack the flexibility to address various aspects of the drug discovery pipeline. In this paper, we present Generalist Molecular generative model (GenMol), a versatile framework that addresses these limitations by applying discrete diffusion to the Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) molecular representation. GenMol generates SAFE sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering and enhanced computational efficiency. Moreover, under the discrete diffusion framework, we introduce fragment remasking, a strategy that optimizes molecules by replacing fragments with masked tokens and regenerating them, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model trained on SAFE representations in de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization. These experimental results demonstrate that GenMol can tackle a wide range of drug discovery tasks, providing a unified and versatile approach for molecular design.</p></details> |  |

Recently developed deep learning methods, particularly diffusion models have reached competitive performance over traditional cheminformatical approaches. However, these methods are often time-consuming or require extra support from traditional methods. We propose EquiBoost, a boosting model that stacks several equivariant graph transformers as weak learners, to iteratively refine 3D conformations of molecules. Without relying on diffusion techniques, EquiBoost balances accuracy and efficiency more effectively than diffusion-based methods. Notably, compared to the previous state-of-the-art diffusion method, EquiBoost improves generation quality and preserves diversity, achieving considerably better precision of Average Minimum RMSD (AMR) on the GEOM datasets. This work rejuvenates boosting and sheds light on its potential to be a robust alternative to diffusion models in certain scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Molecule Generation Using Latent Space Graph Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03696v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating molecular graphs is a challenging task due to their discrete nature and the competitive objectives involved. Diffusion models have emerged as SOTA approaches in data generation across various modalities. For molecular graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) as a diffusion backbone have achieved impressive results. Latent space diffusion, where diffusion occurs in a low-dimensional space via an autoencoder, has demonstrated computational efficiency. However, the literature on latent space diffusion for molecular graphs is scarce, and no commonly accepted best practices exist. In this work, we explore different approaches and hyperparameters, contrasting generative flow models (denoising diffusion, flow matching, heat dissipation) and architectures (GNNs and E(3)-equivariant GNNs). Our experiments reveal a high sensitivity to the choice of approach and design decisions.

| **[Navigating Chemical-Linguistic Sharing Space with Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20888v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical language models (CLMs) are prominent for their effectiveness in exploring chemical space and enabling molecular engineering. However, while exploring chemical-linguistic space, CLMs suffer from the gap between natural language and molecular representations. This challenge is primarily due to the inherent modeling differences between molecules and texts: molecules operate unified modeling to learn chemical space, while natural language sequentially models the semantic space. Additionally, the limited availability of high-quality text-to-molecule datasets further exacerbates this challenge. To address the problem, we first verified the information bias in molecular representations from different perspectives. We then developed the Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding (HME) framework, a unified molecular encoder compressing the molecular features from fragment sequence, topology, and conformation with Q-learning. To better model chemical-linguistic space, we further constructed the MCMoD dataset, which contains over one million molecules with various conditions, including properties, fragments, and descriptions. Experimentally, HME promotes CLMs to achieve chemical-linguistic sharing space exploration: (1) chemical space exploration with linguistic guidance, where HME achieves significant improvements (+8.9\% FCD) for molecular design in multiple constraints, even in zero-shot scenarios; (2) linguistic space exploration with molecular guidance, where HME generates textual descriptions with high qualities (+11.6\% BLEU) for molecules. These results highlight the precision of HME in handling multi-objective and cross-domain tasks, as well as its remarkable generalization capability on unseen task combinations. HME offers a new perspective on navigating chemical-linguistic sharing space, advancing the potential of CLMs in both fundamental research and practical applications in chemistry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

However, current molecular diffusion models are tailored towards a specific downstream task and lack adaptability. We introduce UniGuide, a framework for controlled geometric guidance of unconditional diffusion models that allows flexible conditioning during inference without the requirement of extra training or networks. We show how applications such as structure-based, fragment-based, and ligand-based drug design are formulated in the UniGuide framework and demonstrate on-par or superior performance compared to specialised models. Offering a more versatile approach, UniGuide has the potential to streamline the development of molecular generative models, allowing them to be readily used in diverse application scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)</p></details> |

We find that a key limitation is not in the molecule generation process itself, but in the poor generalization capabilities of molecular property predictors. We tackle this challenge by creating an active-learning, closed-loop molecule generation pipeline, whereby molecular generative models are iteratively refined on feedback from quantum chemical simulations to improve generalization to new chemical space. Compared against other generative model approaches, only our active learning approach generates molecules with properties that extrapolate beyond the training data (reaching up to 0.44 standard deviations beyond the training data range) and out-of-distribution molecule classification accuracy is improved by 79%. By conditioning molecular generation on thermodynamic stability data from the active-learning loop, the proportion of stable molecules generated is 3.5x higher than the next-best model.</p></details> |  |

Dissipativity is a crucial indicator for dynamical systems that generalizes stability and input-output stability, known to be valid across various systems including robotics, biological systems, and molecular dynamics. By analytically proving the general solution to the nonlinear Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for dissipativity, we propose a differentiable projection that transforms any dynamics represented by neural networks into dissipative ones and a learning method for the transformed dynamics. Utilizing the generality of dissipativity, our method strictly guarantee stability, input-output stability, and energy conservation of trained dynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method against out-of-domain input through applications to robotic arms and fluid dynamics.

However, in molecular science, CMs are less common than black-box models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), due to their need for predefined concepts and manual labeling. This paper introduces the Automated Molecular Concept (AutoMolCo) framework, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate and label predictive molecular concepts. Through iterative concept refinement, AutoMolCo enables simple linear models to outperform GNNs and LLM in-context learning on several benchmarks. The framework operates without human knowledge input, overcoming limitations of existing CMs while maintaining explainability and allowing easy intervention. Experiments on MoleculeNet and High-Throughput Experimentation (HTE) datasets demonstrate that AutoMolCo-induced explainable CMs are beneficial for molecular science research.</p></details> |  |

More recently, these workflows have been significantly augmented with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and systems of autonomous agents capable of utilizing pre-trained models to make predictions in the context of more complex research tasks. While effective, there is still room for substantial improvement within agentic systems on the retrieval of salient information for material design tasks. Within this context, alternative uses of predictive deep learning models, such as leveraging their latent representations to facilitate cross-modal retrieval augmented generation within agentic systems for task-specific materials design, has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained chemistry foundation models can serve as a basis for enabling structure-focused, semantic chemistry information retrieval for both small-molecules, complex polymeric materials, and reactions. Additionally, we show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with multi-modal models such as OpenCLIP facilitate unprecedented queries and information retrieval across multiple characterization data domains. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of these models within multi-agent systems to facilitate structure and topological-based natural language queries and information retrieval for different research tasks.</p></details> |  |

Here we hypothesized that ORs can be viewed as 3D spatial filters that extract molecular features relevant to the olfactory system, similarly to the spatio-temporal filters found in other sensory modalities. To build these filters, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict human olfactory percepts obtained from several semantic datasets. Our neural network, the DeepNose, produced responses that are approximately invariant to the molecules' orientation, due to its equivariant architecture. Our network offers high-fidelity perceptual predictions for different olfactory datasets. In addition, our approach allows us to identify molecular features that contribute to specific perceptual descriptors. Because the DeepNose network is designed to be aligned with the biological system, our approach predicts distinct perceptual qualities for different stereoisomers. The architecture of the DeepNose relying on the processing of several molecules at the same time permits inferring the perceptual quality of odor mixtures. We propose that the DeepNose network can use 3D molecular shapes to generate high-quality predictions for human olfactory percepts and help identify molecular features responsible for odor quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, to be appear in the proceedings of Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (ACSSC 2024)</p></details> |

While early work has shown that ML-based retrosynthesis models can predict reasonable routes, their low accuracy for less frequent, yet important reactions has been pointed out. As multi-step search algorithms are limited to reactions suggested by the underlying model, the applicability of those tools is inherently constrained by the accuracy of retrosynthesis prediction. Inspired by how chemists use different strategies to ideate reactions, we propose Chimera: a framework for building highly accurate reaction models that combine predictions from diverse sources with complementary inductive biases using a learning-based ensembling strategy. We instantiate the framework with two newly developed models, which already by themselves achieve state of the art in their categories. Through experiments across several orders of magnitude in data scale and time-splits, we show Chimera outperforms all major models by a large margin, owing both to the good individual performance of its constituents, but also to the scalability of our ensembling strategy. Moreover, we find that PhD-level organic chemists prefer predictions from Chimera over baselines in terms of quality. Finally, we transfer the largest-scale checkpoint to an internal dataset from a major pharmaceutical company, showing robust generalization under distribution shift. With the new dimension that our framework unlocks, we anticipate further acceleration in the development of even more accurate models.</p></details> |  |

The model captures the information of the forces and local constraints between atoms so that the generated molecules can maintain Euclidean transformation and high level of effectiveness and diversity. We also use the lowerrank manifold advantage of the latent variables of the latent model to fuse the information of the forces between atoms to better maintain the geometric equivariant properties of the molecules. Because there is no need to perform information fusion encoding in stages like traditional encoders and decoders, this reduces the amount of calculation in the back-propagation process. The model keeps the forces and local constraints of particle bonds in the latent variable space, reducing the impact of underfitting on the surface of the network on the large position drift of the particle geometry, so that our model can converge earlier. We introduce a distribution control variable in each backward step to strengthen exploration and improve the diversity of generation. In the experiment, the quality of the samples we generated and the convergence speed of the model have been significantly improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.05710 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Tokenizing 3D Molecule Structure with Quantized Spherical Coordinates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01564v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of language models (LMs) to molecular structure generation using line notations such as SMILES and SELFIES has been well-established in the field of cheminformatics. However, extending these models to generate 3D molecular structures presents significant challenges. Two primary obstacles emerge: (1) the difficulty in designing a 3D line notation that ensures SE(3)-invariant atomic coordinates, and (2) the non-trivial task of tokenizing continuous coordinates for use in LMs, which inherently require discrete inputs. To address these challenges, we propose Mol-StrucTok, a novel method for tokenizing 3D molecular structures. Our approach comprises two key innovations: (1) We design a line notation for 3D molecules by extracting local atomic coordinates in a spherical coordinate system. This notation builds upon existing 2D line notations and remains agnostic to their specific forms, ensuring compatibility with various molecular representation schemes. (2) We employ a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to tokenize these coordinates, treating them as generation descriptors. To further enhance the representation, we incorporate neighborhood bond lengths and bond angles as understanding descriptors. Leveraging this tokenization framework, we train a GPT-2 style model for 3D molecular generation tasks. Results demonstrate strong performance with significantly faster generation speeds and competitive chemical stability compared to previous methods. Further, by integrating our learned discrete representations into Graphormer model for property prediction on QM9 dataset, Mol-StrucTok reveals consistent improvements across various molecular properties, underscoring the versatility and robustness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, preprint</p></details> |

While traditional methods for designing new ionizable lipids are typically time-consuming, deep generative models have emerged as a powerful solution, significantly accelerating the molecular discovery process. However, a practical challenge arises as the molecular structures generated can often be difficult or infeasible to synthesize. This project explores Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)-based generative models for synthesizable ionizable lipids. Leveraging a synthetically accessible lipid building block dataset and two specialized predictors to guide the search through chemical space, we introduce a policy network guided MCTS generative model capable of producing new ionizable lipids with available synthesis pathways.</p></details> |  |

The denoising process of score matching or diffusion models mirrors molecular structure optimization, where scores act like physical force fields that guide particles toward equilibrium states. To achieve energetically accurate structures, it can be advantageous to have the score closely approximate the gradient of the actual potential energy surface. Unlike conventional methods that simply design the target score based on structural differences in Euclidean space, we propose a Riemannian score matching approach. This method represents molecular structures on a manifold defined by physics-informed internal coordinates to efficiently mimic the energy landscape, and performs noising and denoising within this space. Our method has been evaluated by refining several types of starting structures on the QM9 and GEOM datasets, demonstrating that the proposed Riemannian score matching method significantly improves the accuracy of the generated molecular structures, attaining chemical accuracy. The implications of this study extend to various applications in computational chemistry, offering a robust tool for accurate molecular structure prediction.</p></details> |  |

Established prediction methods range from fully physics-based ab-initio calculations, which are only feasible for very simple systems, over descriptor-based methods that use some information on the molecules to be modeled together with fitted model parameters (e.g., quantitative-structure-property relationship methods or classical group contribution methods), to representation-learning methods, which may, in extreme cases, completely ignore molecular descriptors and extrapolate only from existing data on the property to be modeled (e.g., matrix completion methods). In this work, we propose a general method for combining molecular descriptors with representation learning using the so-called expectation maximization algorithm from the probabilistic machine learning literature, which uses uncertainty estimates to trade off between the two approaches. The proposed hybrid model exploits chemical structure information using graph neural networks, but it automatically detects cases where structure-based predictions are unreliable, in which case it corrects them by representation-learning based predictions that can better specialize to unusual cases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the prediction of activity coefficients in binary mixtures as an example. The results are compelling, as the method significantly improves predictive accuracy over the current state of the art, showcasing its potential to advance the prediction of physico-chemical properties in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, including 11 pages of main text and 3 pages of appendix, added analysis of improvements in predictive accuracy, added Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7</p></details> |

Flow matching is a recently proposed generative modeling framework that has achieved impressive performance on a variety of tasks including those on biomolecular structures. The seminal flow matching framework was developed only for continuous data. However, de novo molecular design tasks require generating discrete data such as atomic elements or sequences of amino acid residues. Several discrete flow matching methods have been proposed recently to address this gap. In this work we benchmark the performance of existing discrete flow matching methods for 3D de novo small molecule generation and provide explanations of their differing behavior. As a result we present FlowMol-CTMC, an open-source model that achieves state of the art performance for 3D de novo design with fewer learnable parameters than existing methods. Additionally, we propose the use of metrics that capture molecule quality beyond local chemical valency constraints and towards higher-order structural motifs. These metrics show that even though basic constraints are satisfied, the models tend to produce unusual and potentially problematic functional groups outside of the training data distribution.

By precisely encoding the molecular space and score functions, e.g., a graph neural network, the molecular design problem is represented and solved as an optimization problem, the solution of which corresponds to a molecule with optimal score. However, both the extremely large search space and complicated scoring process limit the use of MIP-based CAMD to specific and tiny problems. Moreover, optimal molecule may not be meaningful in practice if scores are imperfect. Instead of pursuing optimality, this paper exploits the ability of MIP in molecular generation and proposes Limeade as an end-to-end tool from real-world needs to feasible molecules. Beyond the basic constraints for structural feasibility, Limeade supports inclusion and exclusion of SMARTS patterns, automating the process of interpreting and formulating chemical requirements to mathematical constraints.</p></details> | 32 pages, 2 figures |

However, molecules are not solely characterized by atom/bond symbols; they encapsulate important physical/chemical properties. Moreover, normal language models bring grammar rules that are irrelevant for understanding molecules. In this study, we propose a novel physicochemical knowledge-guided molecular meta language framework MolMetaLM. We design a molecule-specialized meta language paradigm, formatted as multiple <S,P,O> (subject, predicate, object) knowledge triples sharing the same S (i.e., molecule) to enhance learning the semantic relationships between physicochemical knowledge and molecules. By introducing different molecular knowledge and noises, the meta language paradigm generates tens of thousands of pretraining tasks. By recovering the token/sequence/order-level noises, MolMetaLM exhibits proficiency in large-scale benchmark evaluations involving property prediction, molecule generation, conformation inference, and molecular optimization. Through MolMetaLM, we offer a new insight for designing language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Practical and Asymptotically Exact Conditional Sampling in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17775v2)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been successful on a range of conditional generation tasks including molecular design and text-to-image generation. However, these achievements have primarily depended on task-specific conditional training or error-prone heuristic approximations. Ideally, a conditional generation method should provide exact samples for a broad range of conditional distributions without requiring task-specific training. To this end, we introduce the Twisted Diffusion Sampler, or TDS. TDS is a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that targets the conditional distributions of diffusion models through simulating a set of weighted particles. The main idea is to use twisting, an SMC technique that enjoys good computational efficiency, to incorporate heuristic approximations without compromising asymptotic exactness. We first find in simulation and in conditional image generation tasks that TDS provides a computational statistical trade-off, yielding more accurate approximations with many particles but with empirical improvements over heuristics with as few as two particles. We then turn to motif-scaffolding, a core task in protein design, using a TDS extension to Riemannian diffusion models. On benchmark test cases, TDS allows flexible conditioning criteria and often outperforms the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/blt2114/twisted_diffusion_sampler</p></details> |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in molecule understanding and generation, yet the alignments between molecules and their corresponding captions remain a significant challenge. Previous endeavours often treat the molecule as a general SMILES string or molecular graph, neglecting the fine-grained alignments between the molecular sub-structures and the descriptive textual phrases, which are crucial for accurate and explainable predictions. In this case, we introduce MolReFlect, a novel teacher-student framework designed to contextually perform the molecule-caption alignments in a fine-grained way. Our approach initially leverages a larger teacher LLM to label the detailed alignments by directly extracting critical phrases from molecule captions or SMILES strings and implying them to corresponding sub-structures or characteristics. To refine these alignments, we propose In-Context Selective Reflection, which retrieves previous extraction results as context examples for teacher LLM to reflect and lets a smaller student LLM select from in-context reflection and previous extraction results. Finally, we enhance the learning process of the student LLM through Chain-of-Thought In-Context Molecule Tuning, integrating the fine-grained alignments and the reasoning processes within the Chain-of-Thought format. Our experimental results demonstrate that MolReFlect enables LLMs like Mistral-7B to significantly outperform the previous baselines, achieving SOTA performance on the ChEBI-20 dataset. This advancement not only enhances the generative capabilities of LLMs in the molecule-caption translation task, but also contributes to a more explainable framework.</p></details> | 22 pages, 12 figures |
| **[S-MolSearch: 3D Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning for Bioactive Molecule Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07462v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual Screening is an essential technique in the early phases of drug discovery, aimed at identifying promising drug candidates from vast molecular libraries. Recently, ligand-based virtual screening has garnered significant attention due to its efficacy in conducting extensive database screenings without relying on specific protein-binding site information. Obtaining binding affinity data for complexes is highly expensive, resulting in a limited amount of available data that covers a relatively small chemical space. Moreover, these datasets contain a significant amount of inconsistent noise. It is challenging to identify an inductive bias that consistently maintains the integrity of molecular activity during data augmentation. To tackle these challenges, we propose S-MolSearch, the first framework to our knowledge, that leverages molecular 3D information and affinity information in semi-supervised contrastive learning for ligand-based virtual screening. Drawing on the principles of inverse optimal transport, S-MolSearch efficiently processes both labeled and unlabeled data, training molecular structural encoders while generating soft labels for the unlabeled data. This design allows S-MolSearch to adaptively utilize unlabeled data within the learning process. Empirically, S-MolSearch demonstrates superior performance on widely-used benchmarks LIT-PCBA and DUD-E. It surpasses both structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening methods for AUROC, BEDROC and EF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molecule Generation with Fragment Retrieval Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12078v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fragment-based drug discovery, in which molecular fragments are assembled into new molecules with desirable biochemical properties, has achieved great success. However, many fragment-based molecule generation methods show limited exploration beyond the existing fragments in the database as they only reassemble or slightly modify the given ones. To tackle this problem, we propose a new fragment-based molecule generation framework with retrieval augmentation, namely Fragment Retrieval-Augmented Generation (f-RAG). f-RAG is based on a pre-trained molecular generative model that proposes additional fragments from input fragments to complete and generate a new molecule. Given a fragment vocabulary, f-RAG retrieves two types of fragments: (1) hard fragments, which serve as building blocks that will be explicitly included in the newly generated molecule, and (2) soft fragments, which serve as reference to guide the generation of new fragments through a trainable fragment injection module. To extrapolate beyond the existing fragments, f-RAG updates the fragment vocabulary with generated fragments via an iterative refinement process which is further enhanced with post-hoc genetic fragment modification. f-RAG can achieve an improved exploration-exploitation trade-off by maintaining a pool of fragments and expanding it with novel and high-quality fragments through a strong generative prior.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

In this study, we introduce a neuroevolution potential (NEP), trained on a dataset generated from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, using the moment tensor potential (MTP) as a reference. The low root mean square errors (RMSEs) for total energy and atomic forces demonstrate the high accuracy and transferability of both the MTP and NEP. We further calculate the phonon density of states (DOS) and radial distribution function (RDF) using both machine learning potentials, comparing the results to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the MTP potential offers slightly higher accuracy, the NEP achieves a remarkable 41-fold increase in computational speed. These findings provide detailed microscopic insights into the dynamics and rapid Cu-ion diffusion, paving the way for future studies on Cu-based solid electrolytes and their applications in energy devices.</p></details> |  |

For decades following the creation of MD, simulations have improved with computing power along the three principal dimensions of accuracy, atom count (spatial scale), and duration (temporal scale). Since the mid-2000s, computer platforms have however failed to provide strong scaling for MD as scale-out CPU and GPU platforms that provide substantial increases to spatial scale do not lead to proportional increases in temporal scale. Important scientific problems therefore remained inaccessible to direct simulation, prompting the development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms that present significant complexity, accuracy, and efficiency challenges. While bespoke MD-only hardware solutions have provided a path to longer timescales for specific physical systems, their impact on the broader community has been mitigated by their limited adaptability to new methods and potentials. In this work, we show that a novel computing architecture, the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine, completely alters the scaling path by delivering unprecedentedly high simulation rates up to 1.144M steps/second for 200,000 atoms whose interactions are described by an Embedded Atom Method potential. This enables direct simulations of the evolution of materials using general-purpose programmable hardware over millisecond timescales, dramatically increasing the space of direct MD simulations that can be carried out.</p></details> |  |

Despite the popularity of probabilistic generative models, numerical experiments benchmarking their performance on molecular data are lacking. In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: Neural Spline Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) Neural Spline Flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) Conditional Flow Matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models appears the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib\textsubscript{9} peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope our taxonomy of probabilistic generative frameworks and numerical results may guide model selection for a wide range of molecular tasks.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, it does not extract key substructures from a single patient visit, resulting in the failure to identify medication molecules suitable for the current patient visit. To address the above limitations, we propose a bimodal molecular recommendation framework named BiMoRec, which introduces 3D molecular structures to obtain atomic 3D coordinates and edge indices, overcoming the inherent lack of high-dimensional molecular information in 2D molecular structures. To retain the fast training and prediction efficiency of the recommendation system, we use bimodal graph contrastive pretraining to maximize the mutual information between the two molecular modalities, achieving the fusion of 2D and 3D molecular graphs. Additionally, we designed a molecular multi-step enhancement mechanism to re-calibrate the molecular weights. Specifically, we employ a pre-training method that captures both 2D and 3D molecular structure representations, along with substructure representations, and leverages contrastive learning to extract mutual information. We then use the pre-trained encoder to generate molecular representations, enhancing them through a three-step process: intra-visit, molecular per-visit, and latest-visit. Finally, we apply temporal information aggregation to generate the final medication combinations. Our implementation on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

These models have been developed inheriting from the advances in natural language processing and computer vision, achieving ever greater results. However, generative molecular modelling has unique challenges that are often overlooked. Chemical validity, interpretability of the generation process and flexibility to variable molecular sizes are among some of the remaining challenges for generative models in computational materials design. In this work, we propose an autoregressive approach that decomposes molecular generation into a sequence of discrete and interpretable steps using molecular fragments as units, a 'molecular story'. Enforcing chemical rules in the stories guarantees the chemical validity of the generated molecules, the discrete sequential steps of a molecular story makes the process transparent improving interpretability, and the autoregressive nature of the approach allows the size of the molecule to be a decision of the model. We demonstrate the validity of the approach in a multi-target inverse design of electroactive organic compounds, focusing on the target properties of solubility, redox potential, and synthetic accessibility. Our results show that the model can effectively bias the generation distribution according to the prompted multi-target objective.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present an exhaustive review of the latest advancements in graph representation learning and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, tailored to handle graph-structured data, excel in deriving insights and predictions from intricate relational information, making them invaluable for tasks involving such data. Graph representation learning, a pivotal approach in analyzing graph-structured data, facilitates numerous downstream tasks and applications across machine learning, data mining, biomedicine, and healthcare. Our work delves into the capabilities of GNNs, examining their foundational designs and their application in addressing real-world challenges. We introduce a GNN equipped with an advanced high-order pooling function, adept at capturing complex node interactions within graph-structured data. This pooling function significantly enhances the GNN's efficacy in both node- and graph-level tasks. Additionally, we propose a molecular graph generative model with a GNN as its core framework. This GNN backbone is proficient in learning invariant and equivariant molecular characteristics. Employing these features, the molecular graph generative model is capable of simultaneously learning and generating molecular graphs with atom-bond structures and precise atom positions. Our models undergo thorough experimental evaluations and comparisons with established methods, showcasing their superior performance in addressing diverse real-world challenges with various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2205.11691, arXiv:2304.14621</p></details> |

While diffusion models have demonstrated their potentiality in molecular graph design, they often suffer from unstable training and inefficient sampling. To enhance generation performance and training stability, we propose GGFlow, a discrete flow matching generative model incorporating optimal transport for molecular graphs and it incorporates an edge-augmented graph transformer to enable the direct communications among chemical bounds. Additionally, GGFlow introduces a novel goal-guided generation framework to control the generative trajectory of our model, aiming to design novel molecular structures with the desired properties. GGFlow demonstrates superior performance on both unconditional and conditional molecule generation tasks, outperforming existing baselines and underscoring its effectiveness and potential for wider application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the Gap between Learning and Inference for Diffusion-Based Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05472v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficacy of diffusion models in generating a spectrum of data modalities, including images, text, and videos, has spurred inquiries into their utility in molecular generation, yielding significant advancements in the field. However, the molecular generation process with diffusion models involves multiple autoregressive steps over a finite time horizon, leading to exposure bias issues inherently. To address the exposure bias issue, we propose a training framework named GapDiff. The core idea of GapDiff is to utilize model-predicted conformations as ground truth probabilistically during training, aiming to mitigate the data distributional disparity between training and inference, thereby enhancing the affinity of generated molecules. We conduct experiments using a 3D molecular generation model on the CrossDocked2020 dataset, and the vina energy and diversity demonstrate the potency of our framework with superior affinity.

However, most existing machine learning methods for small molecule generation suffer from poor synthesizability of candidate compounds, making experimental validation difficult. In this paper we propose Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), an extension of the GFlowNet framework that operates directly in the space of chemical reactions, thereby allowing out-of-the-box synthesizability while maintaining comparable quality of generated candidates. We demonstrate that with the proposed set of reactions and building blocks, it is possible to obtain a search space of molecules orders of magnitude larger than existing screening libraries coupled with low cost of synthesis. We also show that the approach scales to very large fragment libraries, further increasing the number of potential molecules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across a range of oracle models, including pretrained proxy models and GPU-accelerated docking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Benefits of Domain-Pretraining of Generative Large Language Models for Chemistry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03542v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A proliferation of Large Language Models (the GPT series, BLOOM, LLaMA, and more) are driving forward novel development of multipurpose AI for a variety of tasks, particularly natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models demonstrate strong performance on a range of tasks; however, there has been evidence of brittleness when applied to more niche or narrow domains where hallucinations or fluent but incorrect responses reduce performance. Given the complex nature of scientific domains, it is prudent to investigate the trade-offs of leveraging off-the-shelf versus more targeted foundation models for scientific domains. In this work, we examine the benefits of in-domain pre-training for a given scientific domain, chemistry, and compare these to open-source, off-the-shelf models with zero-shot and few-shot prompting. Our results show that not only do in-domain base models perform reasonably well on in-domain tasks in a zero-shot setting but that further adaptation using instruction fine-tuning yields impressive performance on chemistry-specific tasks such as named entity recognition and molecular formula generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathway-Guided Optimization of Deep Generative Molecular Design Models for Cancer Therapy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03460v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The data-driven drug design problem can be formulated as an optimization task of a potentially expensive black-box objective function over a huge high-dimensional and structured molecular space. The junction tree variational autoencoder (JTVAE) has been shown to be an efficient generative model that can be used for suggesting legitimate novel drug-like small molecules with improved properties. While the performance of the generative molecular design (GMD) scheme strongly depends on the initial training data, one can improve its sampling efficiency for suggesting better molecules with enhanced properties by optimizing the latent space. In this work, we propose how mechanistic models - such as pathway models described by differential equations - can be used for effective latent space optimization(LSO) of JTVAEs and other similar models for GMD. To demonstrate the potential of our proposed approach, we show how a pharmacodynamic model, assessing the therapeutic efficacy of a drug-like small molecule by predicting how it modulates a cancer pathway, can be incorporated for effective LSO of data-driven models for GMD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-biased molecular dynamics for learning uniformly accurate interatomic potentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01416v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently creating a concise but comprehensive data set for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is an under-explored problem. Active learning, which uses biased or unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) to generate candidate pools, aims to address this objective. Existing biased and unbiased MD-simulation methods, however, are prone to miss either rare events or extrapolative regions -- areas of the configurational space where unreliable predictions are made. This work demonstrates that MD, when biased by the MLIP's energy uncertainty, simultaneously captures extrapolative regions and rare events, which is crucial for developing uniformly accurate MLIPs. Furthermore, exploiting automatic differentiation, we enhance bias-forces-driven MD with the concept of bias stress. We employ calibrated gradient-based uncertainties to yield MLIPs with similar or, sometimes, better accuracy than ensemble-based methods at a lower computational cost. Finally, we apply uncertainty-biased MD to alanine dipeptide and MIL-53(Al), generating MLIPs that represent both configurational spaces more accurately than models trained with conventional MD.</p></details> |  |

However, conditional molecular generation remains a fundamental challenge due to an intrinsic trade-off between targeting specific chemical properties and generating meaningful samples from the data distribution. In this work, we present Time-Aware Conditional Synthesis (TACS), a novel approach to conditional generation on diffusion models. It integrates adaptively controlled plug-and-play "online" guidance into a diffusion model, driving samples toward the desired properties while maintaining validity and stability. A key component of our algorithm is our new type of diffusion sampler, Time Correction Sampler (TCS), which is used to control guidance and ensure that the generated molecules remain on the correct manifold at each reverse step of the diffusion process at the same time. Our proposed method demonstrates significant performance in conditional 3D molecular generation and offers a promising approach towards inverse molecular design, potentially facilitating advancements in drug discovery, materials science, and other related fields.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

The advancements in LLMs and instruction tuning have led to the development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, the competency of the LLMs and instruction tuning have been less explored in the molecular domain. Thus, we propose LLaMo: Large Language Model-based Molecular graph assistant, which is an end-to-end trained large molecular graph-language model. To bridge the discrepancy between the language and graph modalities, we present the multi-level graph projector that transforms graph representations into graph tokens by abstracting the output representations of each GNN layer and motif representations with the cross-attention mechanism. We also introduce machine-generated molecular graph instruction data to instruction-tune the large molecular graph-language model for general-purpose molecule and language understanding. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaMo shows the best performance on diverse tasks, such as molecular description generation, property prediction, and IUPAC name prediction.

| **[Fisher Flow Matching for Generative Modeling over Discrete Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14664v4)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling over discrete data has recently seen numerous success stories, with applications spanning language modeling, biological sequence design, and graph-structured molecular data. The predominant generative modeling paradigm for discrete data is still autoregressive, with more recent alternatives based on diffusion or flow-matching falling short of their impressive performance in continuous data settings, such as image or video generation. In this work, we introduce Fisher-Flow, a novel flow-matching model for discrete data. Fisher-Flow takes a manifestly geometric perspective by considering categorical distributions over discrete data as points residing on a statistical manifold equipped with its natural Riemannian metric: the $\textit{Fisher-Rao metric}$. As a result, we demonstrate discrete data itself can be continuously reparameterised to points on the positive orthant of the $d$-hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^d_+$, which allows us to define flows that map any source distribution to target in a principled manner by transporting mass along (closed-form) geodesics of $\mathbb{S}^d_+$. Furthermore, the learned flows in Fisher-Flow can be further bootstrapped by leveraging Riemannian optimal transport leading to improved training dynamics. We prove that the gradient flow induced by Fisher-Flow is optimal in reducing the forward KL divergence. We evaluate Fisher-Flow on an array of synthetic and diverse real-world benchmarks, including designing DNA Promoter, and DNA Enhancer sequences. Empirically, we find that Fisher-Flow improves over prior diffusion and flow-matching models on these benchmarks.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Existing state-of-the-art approaches either resort to large scale transformer-based models that diffuse over conformer fields, or use computationally expensive methods to generate initial structures and diffuse over torsion angles. In this work, we introduce Equivariant Transformer Flow (ET-Flow). We showcase that a well-designed flow matching approach with equivariance and harmonic prior alleviates the need for complex internal geometry calculations and large architectures, contrary to the prevailing methods in the field. Our approach results in a straightforward and scalable method that directly operates on all-atom coordinates with minimal assumptions. With the advantages of equivariance and flow matching, ET-Flow significantly increases the precision and physical validity of the generated conformers, while being a lighter model and faster at inference.

In this work, we observe that GFlowNets tend to under-exploit the high-reward objects due to training on insufficient number of trajectories, which may lead to a large gap between the estimated flow and the (known) reward value. In response to this challenge, we propose a pessimistic backward policy for GFlowNets (PBP-GFN), which maximizes the observed flow to align closely with the true reward for the object. We extensively evaluate PBP-GFN across eight benchmarks, including hyper-grid environment, bag generation, structured set generation, molecular generation, and four RNA sequence generation tasks. In particular, PBP-GFN enhances the discovery of high-reward objects, maintains the diversity of the objects, and consistently outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Blurring Diffusion for Hierarchical Molecular Conformer Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20255v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can diffusion models process 3D geometries in a coarse-to-fine manner, akin to our multiscale view of the world? In this paper, we address the question by focusing on a fundamental biochemical problem of generating 3D molecular conformers conditioned on molecular graphs in a multiscale manner. Our approach consists of two hierarchical stages: i) generation of coarse-grained fragment-level 3D structure from the molecular graph, and ii) generation of fine atomic details from the coarse-grained approximated structure while allowing the latter to be adjusted simultaneously. For the challenging second stage, which demands preserving coarse-grained information while ensuring SE(3) equivariance, we introduce a novel generative model termed Equivariant Blurring Diffusion (EBD), which defines a forward process that moves towards the fragment-level coarse-grained structure by blurring the fine atomic details of conformers, and a reverse process that performs the opposite operation using equivariant networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EBD by geometric and chemical comparison to state-of-the-art denoising diffusion models on a benchmark of drug-like molecules. Ablation studies draw insights on the design of EBD by thoroughly analyzing its architecture, which includes the design of the loss function and the data corruption process.

To address this, the Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) representation was recently introduced as an alternative that streamlines those tasks. In this study, we investigate the optimal setups for training SAFE generative models, focusing on dataset size, data augmentation through randomization, model architecture, and bond disconnection algorithms. We found that larger, more diverse datasets improve performance, with the LLaMA architecture using Rotary Positional Embedding proving most robust. SAFE-based models also consistently outperform SMILES-based approaches in scaffold decoration and linker design, particularly with BRICS decomposition yielding the best results. These insights highlight key factors that significantly impact the efficacy of SAFE-based generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Design of Functional Metal Complexes Utilizing the Internal Knowledge of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18136v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing functional transition metal complexes (TMCs) faces challenges due to the vast search space of metals and ligands, requiring efficient optimization strategies. Traditional genetic algorithms (GAs) are commonly used, employing random mutations and crossovers driven by explicit mathematical objectives to explore this space. Transferring knowledge between different GA tasks, however, is difficult. We integrate large language models (LLMs) into the evolutionary optimization framework (LLM-EO) and apply it in both single- and multi-objective optimization for TMCs. We find that LLM-EO surpasses traditional GAs by leveraging the chemical knowledge of LLMs gained during their extensive pretraining. Remarkably, without supervised fine-tuning, LLMs utilize the full historical data from optimization processes, outperforming those focusing only on top-performing TMCs. LLM-EO successfully identifies eight of the top-20 TMCs with the largest HOMO-LUMO gaps by proposing only 200 candidates out of a 1.37 million TMCs space. Through prompt engineering using natural language, LLM-EO introduces unparalleled flexibility into multi-objective optimizations, thereby circumventing the necessity for intricate mathematical formulations. As generative models, LLMs can suggest new ligands and TMCs with unique properties by merging both internal knowledge and external chemistry data, thus combining the benefits of efficient optimization and molecular generation. With increasing potential of LLMs as pretrained foundational models and new post-training inference strategies, we foresee broad applications of LLM-based evolutionary optimization in chemistry and materials design.</p></details> |  |

Such virtual screening depends in part on methods to predict the binding affinity between ligands and proteins. Many computational models for binding affinity prediction have been developed, but with varying results across targets. Given that ensembling or meta-modeling approaches have shown great promise in reducing model-specific biases, we develop a framework to integrate published force-field-based empirical docking and sequence-based deep learning models. In building this framework, we evaluate many combinations of individual base models, training databases, and several meta-modeling approaches. We show that many of our meta-models significantly improve affinity predictions over base models. Our best meta-models achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art deep learning tools exclusively based on 3D structures, while allowing for improved database scalability and flexibility through the explicit inclusion of features such as physicochemical properties or molecular descriptors. We further demonstrate improved generalization capability by our models using a large-scale benchmark of affinity prediction as well as a virtual screening application benchmark. Overall, we demonstrate that diverse modeling approaches can be ensembled together to gain meaningful improvement in binding affinity prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 6 main tables, 6 main figures, 8 supplementary figures, and supporting information.

| **[Text-Guided Multi-Property Molecular Optimization with a Diffusion Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13597v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization (MO) is a crucial stage in drug discovery in which task-oriented generated molecules are optimized to meet practical industrial requirements. Existing mainstream MO approaches primarily utilize external property predictors to guide iterative property optimization. However, learning all molecular samples in the vast chemical space is unrealistic for predictors. As a result, errors and noise are inevitably introduced during property prediction due to the nature of approximation. This leads to discrepancy accumulation, generalization reduction and suboptimal molecular candidates. In this paper, we propose a text-guided multi-property molecular optimization method utilizing transformer-based diffusion language model (TransDLM). TransDLM leverages standardized chemical nomenclature as semantic representations of molecules and implicitly embeds property requirements into textual descriptions, thereby preventing error propagation during diffusion process. Guided by physically and chemically detailed textual descriptions, TransDLM samples and optimizes encoded source molecules, retaining core scaffolds of source molecules and ensuring structural similarities. Moreover, TransDLM enables simultaneous sampling of multiple molecules, making it ideal for scalable, efficient large-scale optimization through distributed computation on web platforms.

| **[It Takes Two to Tango: Directly Optimizing for Constrained Synthesizability in Generative Molecular Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11527v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained synthesizability is an unaddressed challenge in generative molecular design. In particular, designing molecules satisfying multi-parameter optimization objectives, while simultaneously being synthesizable and enforcing the presence of specific commercial building blocks in the synthesis. This is practically important for molecule re-purposing, sustainability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel reward function called TANimoto Group Overlap (TANGO), which uses chemistry principles to transform a sparse reward function into a dense and learnable reward function -- crucial for reinforcement learning. TANGO can augment general-purpose molecular generative models to directly optimize for constrained synthesizability while simultaneously optimizing for other properties relevant to drug discovery using reinforcement learning. Our framework is general and addresses starting-material, intermediate, and divergent synthesis constraints. Contrary to most existing works in the field, we show that incentivizing a general-purpose (without any inductive biases) model is a productive approach to navigating challenging optimization scenarios. We demonstrate this by showing that the trained models explicitly learn a desirable distribution. Our framework is the first generative approach to tackle constrained synthesizability.</p></details> |  |

While recent work has primarily focused on data-driven approaches, the KANO model introduces a novel paradigm by incorporating knowledge-enhanced pre-training. In this work, we expand upon KANO by integrating the large-scale ChEBI knowledge graph, which includes 2,840 functional groups -- significantly more than the original 82 used in KANO. We explore two approaches, Replace and Integrate, to incorporate this extensive knowledge into the KANO framework. Our results demonstrate that including ChEBI leads to improved performance on 9 out of 14 molecular property prediction datasets. This highlights the importance of utilizing a larger and more diverse set of functional groups to enhance molecular representations for property predictions.

Traditionally, watermarking techniques have been developed primarily for rich information media such as images and audio. However, these methods have not been adequately adapted for graph-based data, particularly molecular graphs. Latent 3D graph diffusion(LDM-3DG) is an ascendant approach in the molecular graph generation field. This model effectively manages the complexities of molecular structures, preserving essential symmetries and topological features. We adapt the Gaussian Shading, a proven performance lossless watermarking technique, to the latent graph diffusion domain to protect this sophisticated new technology. Our adaptation simplifies the watermark diffusion process through duplication and padding, making it adaptable and suitable for various message types. We conduct several experiments using the LDM-3DG model on publicly available datasets QM9 and Drugs, to assess the robustness and effectiveness of our technique. Our results demonstrate that the watermarked molecules maintain statistical parity in 9 out of 10 performance metrics compared to the original. Moreover, they exhibit a 100% detection rate and a 99% extraction rate in a 2D decoded pipeline, while also showing robustness against post-editing attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models mostly work with SMILES and SELFIES chemical string representations, which lack spatial features vital for drug discovery. Additionally, attempts to translate chemical 3D structures into text format encounter issues such as excessive length and insufficient atom connectivity information. To address these issues, we introduce nach0-pc, a model combining domain-specific encoder and textual representation to handle spatial arrangement of atoms effectively. Our approach utilizes a molecular point cloud encoder for concise and order-invariant structure representation. We introduce a novel pre-training scheme for molecular point clouds to distillate the knowledge from spatial molecular structures datasets. After fine-tuning within both single-task and multi-task frameworks, nach0-pc demonstrates performance comparable with other diffusion models in terms of generated samples quality across several established spatial molecular generation tasks. Notably, our model is a multi-task approach, in contrast to diffusion models being limited to single tasks. Additionally, it is capable of processing point cloud-related data, which language models are not capable of handling due to memory limitations. These lead to our model having reduced training and inference time while maintaining on par performance.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce a multi-constraint molecular generation large language model, TSMMG, which, akin to a student, incorporates knowledge from various small models and tools, namely, the 'teachers'. To train TSMMG, we construct a large set of text-molecule pairs by extracting molecular knowledge from these 'teachers', enabling it to generate novel molecules that conform to the descriptions through various text prompts. We experimentally show that TSMMG remarkably performs in generating molecules meeting complex, natural language-described property requirements across two-, three-, and four-constraint tasks, with an average molecular validity of over 99% and success ratio of 82.58%, 68.03%, and 67.48%, respectively. The model also exhibits adaptability through zero-shot testing, creating molecules that satisfy combinations of properties that have not been encountered. It can comprehend text inputs with various language styles, extending beyond the confines of outlined prompts, as confirmed through empirical validation. Additionally, the knowledge distillation feature of TSMMG contributes to the continuous enhancement of small models, while the innovative approach to dataset construction effectively addresses the issues of data scarcity and quality, which positions TSMMG as a promising tool in the domains of drug discovery and materials science.</p></details> | 37 pages, 10 figures |

The packing structure of these materials plays a crucial role in determining their electronic and transport properties, which are key to enhancing the efficiency of devices like organic solar cells (OSCs). However, obtaining these optoelectronic properties computationally requires molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to generate a conformational ensemble, a process that can be computationally expensive due to the large system sizes involved. Recent advances have focused on using generative models, particularly flow-based models as Boltzmann generators, to improve the efficiency of MD sampling. In this work, we developed a dual-scale flow matching method that separates training and inference into coarse-grained and all-atom stages and enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of standard flow matching samplers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a dataset of Y6 molecular clusters obtained through MD simulations, and we benchmark its efficiency and accuracy against single-scale flow matching methods.</p></details> |  |

However, proper reasoning based on molecular structural information remains a significant challenge, e.g., even advanced LLMs such as GPT-4o struggle to identify functional groups which are crucial for inferring the molecular property of interest. To address this limitation, we propose StructCoT, a structure-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) that enhances LLMs' understanding of molecular structures by explicitly injecting the key structural features of molecules. Moreover, we introduce two fine-tuning frameworks for adapting the existing LLMs to use our StructCoT. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating StructCoT with our fine-tuning frameworks leads to consistent improvements in both molecular understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

This difficulty stems from the need for coherent autoregressive generation across texts and graphs. To address this, we introduce Llamole, the first multimodal LLM capable of interleaved text and graph generation, enabling molecular inverse design with retrosynthetic planning. Llamole integrates a base LLM with the Graph Diffusion Transformer and Graph Neural Networks for multi-conditional molecular generation and reaction inference within texts, while the LLM, with enhanced molecular understanding, flexibly controls activation among the different graph modules. Additionally, Llamole integrates A* search with LLM-based cost functions for efficient retrosynthetic planning. We create benchmarking datasets and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate Llamole against in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning.

We demonstrate SynFormer's effectiveness in two key applications: (1) local chemical space exploration, where the model generates synthesizable analogs of a reference molecule, and (2) global chemical space exploration, where the model aims to identify optimal molecules according to a black-box property prediction oracle. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach via the improvement in performance as more computational resources become available.

Recently, they have been transposed to continuous time, allowing more flexibility in the reverse process and a better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Here, to leverage the benefits of both approaches, we propose Cometh, a continuous-time discrete-state graph diffusion model, tailored to the specificities of graph data. In addition, we also successfully replaced the set of structural encodings previously used in the discrete graph diffusion model with a single random-walk-based encoding, providing a simple and principled way to boost the model's expressive power. Empirically, we show that integrating continuous time leads to significant improvements across various metrics over state-of-the-art discrete-state diffusion models on a large set of molecular and non-molecular benchmark datasets. In terms of VUN samples, Cometh obtains a near-perfect performance of 99.5% on the planar graph dataset and outperforms DiGress by 12.6% on the large GuacaMol dataset.</p></details> | 23 pages |

We present the Graph Diffusion Transformer (Graph DiT) for multi-conditional molecular generation. Graph DiT integrates an encoder to learn numerical and categorical property representations with the Transformer-based denoiser. Unlike previous graph diffusion models that add noise separately on the atoms and bonds in the forward diffusion process, Graph DiT is trained with a novel graph-dependent noise model for accurate estimation of graph-related noise in molecules. We extensively validate Graph DiT for multi-conditional polymer and small molecule generation. Results demonstrate the superiority of Graph DiT across nine metrics from distribution learning to condition control for molecular properties.

This encoding converts complex molecular graphs into tree-structured formats, such as JSON and XML, which LLMs are particularly adept at processing due to their extensive pre-training on these types of data. By leveraging the flexibility of LLMs, our approach allows for intuitive interaction using natural language prompts, providing a more accessible interface for molecular design. Through supervised fine-tuning, G2T-LLM generates valid and coherent chemical structures, addressing common challenges like invalid outputs seen in traditional graph-based methods. While LLMs are computationally intensive, they offer superior generalization and adaptability, enabling the generation of diverse molecular structures with minimal task-specific customization.

We propose 3M-Diffusion, a novel multi-modal molecular graph generation method, to generate diverse, ideally novel molecular structures with desired properties. 3M-Diffusion encodes molecular graphs into a graph latent space which it then aligns with the text space learned by encoder-based LLMs from textual descriptions. It then reconstructs the molecular structure and atomic attributes based on the given text descriptions using the molecule decoder. It then learns a probabilistic mapping from the text space to the latent molecular graph space using a diffusion model. The results of our extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that 3M-Diffusion can generate high-quality, novel and diverse molecular graphs that semantically match the textual description provided.</p></details> |  |

DiGress is a recent diffusion model for molecular graphs whose distinctive feature is allowing property targeting through classifier-based (CB) guidance. While CB guidance may work to generate molecular-like graphs, we hint at the fact that its assumptions apply poorly to the chemical domain. Based on this insight we propose a classifier-free DiGress (FreeGress), which works by directly injecting the conditioning information into the training process. CF guidance is convenient given its less stringent assumptions and since it does not require to train an auxiliary property regressor, thus halving the number of trainable parameters in the model. We empirically show that our model yields up to 79% improvement in Mean Absolute Error with respect to DiGress on property targeting tasks on QM9 and ZINC-250k benchmarks. As an additional contribution, we propose a simple yet powerful approach to improve chemical validity of generated samples, based on the observation that certain chemical properties such as molecular weight correlate with the number of atoms in molecules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ECML PKDD 2024</p></details> |

In contrast, alternative tokenization methods have demonstrated superior performance. This study introduces a molecular GAN that integrates a byte level byte-pair encoding tokenizer and employs reinforcement learning to enhance de novo molecular generation. Specifically, the generator functions as an actor, producing SMILES strings, while the discriminator acts as a critic, evaluating their quality. Our molecular GAN also integrates innovative reward mechanisms aimed at improving computational efficiency. Experimental results assessing validity, uniqueness, novelty, and diversity, complemented by detailed visualization analysis, robustly demonstrate the effectiveness of our GAN.</p></details> |  |

We introduce generative modeling of molecular trajectories as a paradigm for learning flexible multi-task surrogate models of MD from data. By conditioning on appropriately chosen frames of the trajectory, we show such generative models can be adapted to diverse tasks such as forward simulation, transition path sampling, and trajectory upsampling. By alternatively conditioning on part of the molecular system and inpainting the rest, we also demonstrate the first steps towards dynamics-conditioned molecular design. We validate the full set of these capabilities on tetrapeptide simulations and show that our model can produce reasonable ensembles of protein monomers. Altogether, our work illustrates how generative modeling can unlock value from MD data towards diverse downstream tasks that are not straightforward to address with existing methods or even MD itself.

Recently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) are effectively used due to their capacity for generating accurate conformations far beyond conventional physics-based approaches. However, the discrepancy between training and inference rises a critical problem known as the exposure bias. While this issue has been extensively investigated in DPMs, the existence of exposure bias in SGMs and its effective measurement remain unsolved, which hinders the use of compensation methods for SGMs, including ConfGF and Torsional Diffusion as the representatives. In this work, we first propose a method for measuring exposure bias in SGMs used for molecular conformation generation, which confirms the significant existence of exposure bias in these models and measures its value. We design a new compensation algorithm Input Perturbation (IP), which is adapted from a method originally designed for DPMs only. Experimental results show that by introducing IP, SGM-based molecular conformation models can significantly improve both the accuracy and diversity of the generated conformations. Especially by using the IP-enhanced Torsional Diffusion model, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the GEOM-Drugs dataset and are on par on GEOM-QM9.

| **[The Iterative Chainlet Partitioning Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone and Neural Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15147v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces the Iterative Chainlet Partitioning (ICP) algorithm and its neural acceleration for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone (TSP-D). The proposed ICP algorithm decomposes a TSP-D solution into smaller segments called chainlets, each optimized individually by a dynamic programming subroutine. The chainlet with the highest improvement is updated and the procedure is repeated until no further improvement is possible. The number of subroutine calls is bounded linearly in problem size for the first iteration and remains constant in subsequent iterations, ensuring algorithmic scalability. Empirical results show that ICP outperforms existing algorithms in both solution quality and computational time. Tested over 1,059 benchmark instances, ICP yields an average improvement of 2.75% in solution quality over the previous state-of-the-art algorithm while reducing computational time by 79.8%. The procedure is deterministic, ensuring reliability without requiring multiple runs. The subroutine is the computational bottleneck in the already efficient ICP algorithm. To reduce the necessity of subroutine calls, we integrate a graph neural network (GNN) to predict incremental improvements. We demonstrate that the resulting Neuro ICP (NICP) achieves substantial acceleration while maintaining solution quality. Compared to ICP, NICP reduces the total computational time by 49.7%, while the objective function value increase is limited to 0.12%. The framework's adaptability to various operational constraints makes it a valuable foundation for developing efficient algorithms for truck-drone synchronized routing problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Degree Bias in Graph Representation Learning with Learnable Structural Augmentation and Structural Self-Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15075v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) update node representations through message passing, which is primarily based on the homophily principle, assuming that adjacent nodes share similar features. However, in real-world graphs with long-tailed degree distributions, high-degree nodes dominate message passing, causing a degree bias where low-degree nodes remain under-represented due to inadequate messages. The main challenge in addressing degree bias is how to discover non-adjacent nodes to provide additional messages to low-degree nodes while reducing excessive messages for high-degree nodes. Nevertheless, exploiting non-adjacent nodes to provide valuable messages is challenging, as it could generate noisy information and disrupt the original graph structures. To solve it, we propose a novel Degree Fairness Graph Transformer, named DegFairGT, to mitigate degree bias by discovering structural similarities between non-adjacent nodes through learnable structural augmentation and structural self-attention. Our key idea is to exploit non-adjacent nodes with similar roles in the same community to generate informative edges under our augmentation, which could provide informative messages between nodes with similar roles while ensuring that the homophily principle is maintained within the community. To enable DegFairGT to learn such structural similarities, we then propose a structural self-attention to capture the similarities between node pairs. To preserve global graph structures and prevent graph augmentation from hindering graph structure, we propose a Self-Supervised Learning task to preserve p-step transition probability and regularize graph augmentation. Extensive experiments on six datasets showed that DegFairGT outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in degree fairness analysis, node classification, and node clustering tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE TNSE</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose an innovative approach that integrates multi-dimensional Hawkes processes with Graph Neural Network, modeling opinion propagation dynamics among nodes in a social network while considering the intricate hierarchical relationships between comments. The extended multi-dimensional Hawkes process captures the hierarchical structure, multi-dimensional interactions, and mutual influences across different topics, forming a complex propagation network. Moreover, recognizing the lack of high-quality datasets capable of comprehensively capturing the evolution of public opinion dynamics, we introduce a new dataset, VISTA. It includes 159 trending topics, corresponding to 47,207 posts, 327,015 second-level comments, and 29,578 third-level comments, covering diverse domains such as politics, entertainment, sports, health, and medicine. The dataset is annotated with detailed sentiment labels across 11 categories and clearly defined hierarchical relationships. When combined with our method, it offers strong interpretability by linking sentiment propagation to the comment hierarchy and temporal evolution. Our approach provides a robust baseline for future research.</p></details> |  |

Existing GNNs primarily operate in Euclidean spaces, which can limit their ability to capture hierarchical and multi-relational structures inherent to complex graphs. LGIN addresses this by incorporating curvature-aware aggregation functions that preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor, ensuring embeddings remain constrained within the hyperbolic space by proposing a new update rule that effectively captures both local neighborhood interactions and global structural properties, enabling LGIN to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs with expressiveness at least as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Through extensive evaluation across nine benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures, LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNNs, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy in modeling complex graph structures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to extend the concept of a powerful graph neural network to Riemannian manifolds, paving the way for future advancements in hyperbolic graph learning.

Existing studies commonly employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to infer clinical diagnoses from node-based brain connectivity matrices generated through node-to-node similarities of regionally averaged fMRI signals.

To handle such complexity, operations teams rely on monitoring systems, including anomaly detection tools that identify unexpected behaviors. In this paper, we present c-ANEMON, a Contextual ANomaly dEtection MONitor for the RAN based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our solution captures spatio-temporal variations by analyzing the behavior of individual cells in relation to their local neighborhoods, enabling the detection of anomalies that are independent of external mobility factors. This, in turn, allows focusing on anomalies associated with network issues (e.g., misconfigurations, equipment failures). We evaluate c-ANEMON using real-world data from a large European metropolitan area (7,890 cells; 3 months). First, we show that the GNN model within our solution generalizes effectively to cells from previously unseen areas, suggesting the possibility of using a single model across extensive deployment regions. Then, we analyze the anomalies detected by c-ANEMON through manual inspection and define several categories of long-lasting anomalies (6+ hours). Notably, 45.95% of these anomalies fall into a category that is more likely to require intervention by operations teams.</p></details> | 7 pages |

It has also been observed that it underlies the design of several graph neural network architectures, whose capabilities and performance can be understood in terms of the expressive power of this test. Motivated by recent developments in machine learning applications to datasets involving three-dimensional objects, we study when the WL test is {\em complete} for clouds of euclidean points represented by complete distance graphs, i.e., when it can distinguish, up to isometry, any arbitrary such cloud. %arbitrary clouds of euclidean points represented by complete distance graphs. % How many dimensions of the Weisfeiler--Lehman test is enough to distinguish any two non-isometric point clouds in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, assuming that these point clouds are given as complete graphs labeled by distances between the points? This question is important for understanding, which architectures of graph neural networks are capable of fully exploiting the spacial structure of a point cloud. Our main result states that the $(d-1)$-dimensional WL test is complete for point clouds in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, for any $d\ge 2$, and that only three iterations of the test suffice. We also observe that the $d$-dimensional WL test only requires one iteration to achieve completeness. Our paper thus provides complete understanding of the 3-dimensional case: it was shown in previous works that 1-WL is not complete in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and we show that 2-WL is complete there. We also strengthen the lower bound for 1-WL by showing that it is unable to recognize planar point clouds in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Finally, we show that 2-WL is not complete in $\mathbb{R}^6$, leaving as an open question, whether it is complete in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ for $d = 4,5$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chang...</summary><p>Changes to previous version: new results, inability of 1-WL to recognize planar point clouds in R^3, and incompleteness of 2-WL in R^6</p></details> |

As numerical attributes become increasingly essential in characterizing entities and relations in KGs, the ability to reason over these attributes has gained significant importance. Existing graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs), primarily focus on aggregating homogeneous local neighbors and implicitly embedding diverse triples. However, these approaches often fail to fully leverage the potential of logical paths within the graph, limiting their effectiveness in exploiting the reasoning process. To address these limitations, we propose ChainsFormer, a novel chain-based framework designed to support numerical reasoning. Chainsformer not only explicitly constructs logical chains but also expands the reasoning depth to multiple hops. Specially, we introduces Relation-Attribute Chains (RA-Chains), a specialized logic chain, to model sequential reasoning patterns. ChainsFormer captures the step-by-step nature of multi-hop reasoning along RA-Chains by employing sequential in-context learning. To mitigate the impact of noisy chains, we propose a hyperbolic affinity scoring mechanism that selects relevant logic chains in a variable-resolution space. Furthermore, ChainsFormer incorporates an attention-based numerical reasoner to identify critical reasoning paths, enhancing both reasoning accuracy and transparency. Experimental results demonstrate that ChainsFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 20.0% improvement in performance. The implementations are available at https://github.com/zhaodazhuang2333/ChainsFormer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICDE 2025</p></details> |

While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions, text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |

We propose HIS_GCNs, a hierarchical importance graph sampling based learning method. By constructing minibatches using sampled subgraphs, HIS_GCNs gives attention to the importance of both core and periphery nodes/edges in a scale-free training graph. Specifically, it preserves the centrum of the core to most minibatches, which maintains connectivity between periphery nodes, and samples periphery edges without core node interference, in order to keep more long chains composed entirely of low-degree nodes in the same minibatch. HIS_GCNs can maximize the discrete Ricci curvature (i.e., Ollivier-Ricci curvatures) of the edges in a subgraph that enables the preservation of important chains for information propagation, and can achieve a low node embedding variance and a high convergence speed. Diverse experiments on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with node classification tasks confirm superior performance of HIS_GCNs in both accuracy and training time.

| **[Dual-channel Heterophilic Message Passing for Graph Fraud Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14205v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fraudulent activities have significantly increased across various domains, such as e-commerce, online review platforms, and social networks, making fraud detection a critical task. Spatial Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to fraud detection tasks due to their strong inductive learning capabilities. However, existing spatial GNN-based methods often enhance the graph structure by excluding heterophilic neighbors during message passing to align with the homophilic bias of GNNs. Unfortunately, this approach can disrupt the original graph topology and increase uncertainty in predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework, Dual-channel Heterophilic Message Passing (DHMP), for fraud detection. DHMP leverages a heterophily separation module to divide the graph into homophilic and heterophilic subgraphs, mitigating the low-pass inductive bias of traditional GNNs. It then applies shared weights to capture signals at different frequencies independently and incorporates a customized sampling strategy for training. This allows nodes to adaptively balance the contributions of various signals based on their labels. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DHMP outperforms existing methods, highlighting the importance of separating signals with different frequencies for improved fraud detection.

The expressivity of GNNs refers to their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs and depends on the encoding of node neighborhoods. We examine the vulnerability of neural multiset functions commonly used for this purpose and establish formal criteria to characterize a GNN's susceptibility to losing expressivity due to BFAs. This enables an analysis of the impact of homophily, graph structural variety, feature encoding, and activation functions on GNN robustness. We derive theoretical bounds for the number of bit flips required to degrade GNN expressivity on a dataset, identifying ReLU-activated GNNs operating on highly homophilous graphs with low-dimensional or one-hot encoded features as particularly susceptible. Empirical results using ten real-world datasets confirm the statistical significance of our key theoretical insights and offer actionable results to mitigate BFA risks in expressivity-critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AISTAST 2025, will add DOI when available</p></details> |

While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> |  |

The set of relations between these radio nodes, referred to as the \emph{mobile network topology}, is vital in the construction of the networking infrastructure. Typically, the connections between radio nodes and their associated cells are defined by software features that establish mobility relations (referred to as \emph{edges} in this paper) within the mobile network graph through heuristic methods. Although these approaches are efficient, they encounter significant limitations, particularly since edges can only be established prior to the installation of physical hardware. In this work, we use graph-based deep learning methods to determine mobility relations (edges), trained on radio node configuration data and reliable mobility relations set by Automatic Neighbor Relations (ANR) in stable networks. This paper focuses on measuring the accuracy and precision of different graph-based deep learning approaches applied to real-world mobile networks. We evaluated two deep learning models. Our comprehensive experiments on Telecom datasets obtained from operational Telecom Networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the graph neural network (GNN) model and multilayer perceptron. Our evaluation showed that considering graph structure improves results, which motivates the use of GNNs. Additionally, we investigated the use of heuristics to reduce the training time based on the distance between radio nodes to eliminate irrelevant cases. Our investigation showed that the use of these heuristics improved precision and accuracy considerably.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE Networking Letters</p></details> |

Graph-based sequential recommendation systems, powered by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), effectively capture complex user-item interactions but often face challenges such as noise and static representations. In this paper, we introduce the Adaptive Long-term Embedding with Denoising and Augmentation for Recommendation (ALDA4Rec) method, a novel model that constructs an item-item graph, filters noise through community detection, and enriches user-item interactions. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are then employed to learn short-term representations, while averaging, GRUs, and attention mechanisms are utilized to model long-term embeddings. An MLP-based adaptive weighting strategy is further incorporated to dynamically optimize long-term user preferences. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that ALDA4Rec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering notable improvements in both accuracy and robustness.

This task involves the extraction of sparse tree-like vascular branches from the volumetric space. However, existing methods have faced significant challenges due to discontinuous vascular segmentation and missing endpoints. To address this issue, a 3D vision graph neural network framework, named ViG3D-UNet, was introduced. This method integrates 3D graph representation and aggregation within a U-shaped architecture to facilitate continuous vascular segmentation. The ViG3D module captures volumetric vascular connectivity and topology, while the convolutional module extracts fine vascular details. These two branches are combined through channel attention to form the encoder feature. Subsequently, a paperclip-shaped offset decoder minimizes redundant computations in the sparse feature space and restores the feature map size to match the original input dimensions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for continuous vascular segmentation, evaluations were performed on two public datasets, ASOCA and ImageCAS. The segmentation results show that the ViG3D-UNet surpassed competing methods in maintaining vascular segmentation connectivity while achieving high segmentation accuracy. Our code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

Thus, the current prevailing paradigm focuses on 3D point-cloud atom representations, utilizing graph neural network (GNN) parametrizations, with rotational symmetries baked in via E(3) invariant layers. We prove that such models must necessarily disregard chirality, a geometric property of the molecules that cannot be superimposed on their mirror image by rotation and translation. Chirality plays a key role in determining drug safety and potency. To address this glaring issue, we introduce a novel field-based representation, proposing reference rotations that replace rotational symmetry constraints. The proposed model captures all molecular geometries including chirality, while still achieving highly competitive performance with E(3)-based methods across standard benchmarking metrics.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Subgraph Aggregation for Out-of-Distribution Generalization on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22228v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has gained significant attention due to its critical importance in graph-based predictions in real-world scenarios. Existing methods primarily focus on extracting a single causal subgraph from the input graph to achieve generalizable predictions. However, relying on a single subgraph can lead to susceptibility to spurious correlations and is insufficient for learning invariant patterns behind graph data. Moreover, in many real-world applications, such as molecular property prediction, multiple critical subgraphs may influence the target label property. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, SubGraph Aggregation (SuGAr), designed to learn a diverse set of subgraphs that are crucial for OOD generalization on graphs. Specifically, SuGAr employs a tailored subgraph sampler and diversity regularizer to extract a diverse set of invariant subgraphs. These invariant subgraphs are then aggregated by averaging their representations, which enriches the subgraph signals and enhances coverage of the underlying causal structures, thereby improving OOD generalization. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that \ours outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 24% improvement in OOD generalization on graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study graph OOD generalization by learning multiple invariant subgraphs. code: https://github.com/Nanolbw/SuGAr</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

The recent work GNNSAFE proposes a framework based on the aggregation of negative energy scores that significantly improves the performance of GNNs to detect node-level OOD data. However, our study finds that score aggregation among nodes is susceptible to extreme values due to the unboundedness of the negative energy scores and logit shifts, which severely limits the accuracy of GNNs in detecting node-level OOD data. In this paper, we propose NODESAFE: reducing the generation of extreme scores of nodes by adding two optimization terms that make the negative energy scores bounded and mitigate the logit shift. Experimental results show that our approach dramatically improves the ability of GNNs to detect OOD data at the node level, e.g., in detecting OOD data induced by Structure Manipulation, the metric of FPR95 (lower is better) in scenarios without (with) OOD data exposure are reduced from the current SOTA by 28.4% (22.7%).</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2302.02914 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Graph Learning at Scale: Characterizing and Optimizing Pre-Propagation GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13266v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning node embeddings in graphs, typically adopting a message-passing scheme. This approach, however, leads to the neighbor explosion problem, with exponentially growing computational and memory demands as layers increase. Graph sampling has become the predominant method for scaling GNNs to large graphs, mitigating but not fully solving the issue. Pre-propagation GNNs (PP-GNNs) represent a new class of models that decouple feature propagation from training through pre-processing, addressing neighbor explosion in theory. Yet, their practical advantages and system-level optimizations remain underexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of PP-GNNs, comparing them with graph-sampling-based methods in training efficiency, scalability, and accuracy. While PP-GNNs achieve comparable accuracy, we identify data loading as the key bottleneck for training efficiency and input expansion as a major scalability challenge. To address these issues, we propose optimized data loading schemes and tailored training methods that improve PP-GNN training throughput by an average of 15$\times$ over the PP-GNN baselines, with speedup of up to 2 orders of magnitude compared to sampling-based GNNs on large graph benchmarks. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/cornell-zhang/preprop-gnn.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods achieve attack stealthiness by constraining the modification budget and differences in graph properties. However, these methods typically disrupt task-relevant primary semantics directly, which results in low defensibility and detectability of the attack. In this paper, we propose an Adversarial Attack on High-level Semantics for Graph Neural Networks (AHSG), which is a graph structure attack model that ensures the retention of primary semantics. By combining latent representations with shared primary semantics, our model retains detectable attributes and relational patterns of the original graph while leveraging more subtle changes to carry out the attack. Then we use the Projected Gradient Descent algorithm to map the latent representations with attack effects to the adversarial graph. Through experiments on robust graph deep learning models equipped with defense strategies, we demonstrate that AHSG outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in attack effectiveness. Additionally, using Contextual Stochastic Block Models to detect the attacked graph further validates that our method preserves the primary semantics of the graph.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, the inference process of GNNs remains costly, hindering their applications for large graphs. This paper proposes inference-friendly graph compression (IFGC), a graph compression scheme to accelerate GNNs inference. Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed graph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that the result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little decompression cost. (1) We characterize IFGC with a class of inference equivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in $G$ that are not distinguishable for GNN inference. (2) We introduce three practical specifications of IFGC for representative GNNs: structural preserving compression (SPGC), which computes $G_c$ that can be directly processed by GNN inference without decompression; ($\alpha$, $r$)-compression, that allows for a configurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and anchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of interest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms with guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse sets of large-scale graphs, which verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our graph compression approaches.</p></details> |  |

On one side, Full Order Models (FOMs) deliver accurate hemodynamic assessments, but their high computational demands hinder their real-time clinical application. In contrast, Reduced Order Models (ROMs) provide more efficient yet accurate solutions, essential for personalized healthcare and timely clinical decision-making. In this work, we explore the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in cardiovascular medicine by integrating FOMs with ROMs for predicting the risk of aortic aneurysm growth and rupture. Wall Shear Stress (WSS) and the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), sampled at different growth stages of the thoracic aortic aneurysm, are predicted by means of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs exploit the natural graph structure of the mesh obtained by the Finite Volume (FV) discretization, taking into account the spatial local information, regardless of the dimension of the input graph. Our experimental validation framework yields promising results, confirming our method as a valid alternative that overcomes the curse of dimensionality.</p></details> |  |

Among recent advancements, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to model complex molecular structures using graph-based representations. However, the integration of explainable methods to elucidate the specific contributions of molecular substructures to biological activity remains a significant challenge. This limitation hampers both the interpretability of predictive models and the rational design of novel therapeutics.\\ Results: We trained 20 GNN models on a dataset of small molecules with the goal of predicting their activity on 20 distinct protein targets from the Kinase family. These classifiers achieved state-of-the-art performance in virtual screening tasks, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness on different targets. Building upon these models, we implemented the Hierarchical Grad-CAM graph Explainer (HGE) framework, enabling an in-depth analysis of the molecular moieties driving protein-ligand binding stabilization. HGE exploits Grad-CAM explanations at the atom, ring, and whole-molecule levels, leveraging the message-passing mechanism to highlight the most relevant chemical moieties. Validation against experimental data from the literature confirmed the ability of the explainer to recognize a molecular pattern of drugs and correctly annotate them to the known target. Conclusion: Our approach may represent a valid support to shorten both the screening and the hit discovery process. Detailed knowledge of the molecular substructures that play a role in the binding process can help the computational chemist to gain insights into the structure optimization, as well as in drug repurposing tasks.</p></details> |  |

Prior studies have attempted to mitigating the impact of distribution shift by reconstructing node features during the testing phase without modifying the model parameters. However, these approaches lack theoretical analysis of the proximity between predictions and ground truth at test time. In this paper, we propose a novel node feature reconstruction method grounded in Lyapunov stability theory. Specifically, we model the GNN as a control system during the testing phase, considering node features as control variables. A neural controller that adheres to the Lyapunov stability criterion is then employed to reconstruct these node features, ensuring that the predictions progressively approach the ground truth at test time. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

It reduces the number of decision variables in a problem by solving a pricing problem. For many CO problems, the pricing problem is an Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (ESPPRC). Large ESPPRC instances are difficult to solve to near-optimality. Consequently, we use a Graph neural Network (GNN) to reduces the size of the ESPPRC such that it becomes computationally tractable with standard solving techniques. Our GNN is trained by Unsupervised Learning and outputs a distribution for the arcs to be retained in the reduced PP. The reduced PP is solved by a local search that finds columns with large reduced costs and speeds up convergence. We apply our method on a set of Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows and show significant improvements in convergence compared to simple reduction techniques from the literature. For a fixed computational budget, we improve the objective values by over 9\% for larger instances. We also analyze the performance of our CG algorithm and test the generalization of our method to different classes of instances than the training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Nonetheless, many proposed hypergraph neural networks effectively reduce hypergraphs to undirected graphs via symmetrized matrix representations, potentially losing important information. We propose an alternative approach to hypergraph neural networks in which the hypergraph is represented as a non-reversible Markov chain. We use this Markov chain to construct a complex Hermitian Laplacian matrix - the magnetic Laplacian - which serves as the input to our proposed hypergraph neural network. We study HyperMagNet for the task of node classification, and demonstrate its effectiveness over graph-reduction based hypergraph neural networks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Transfer Learning for Temporal Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10925v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction on graphs has applications spanning from recommender systems to drug discovery. Temporal link prediction (TLP) refers to predicting future links in a temporally evolving graph and adds additional complexity related to the dynamic nature of graphs. State-of-the-art TLP models incorporate memory modules alongside graph neural networks to learn both the temporal mechanisms of incoming nodes and the evolving graph topology. However, memory modules only store information about nodes seen at train time, and hence such models cannot be directly transferred to entirely new graphs at test time and deployment. In this work, we study a new transfer learning task for temporal link prediction, and develop transfer-effective methods for memory-laden models. Specifically, motivated by work showing the informativeness of structural signals for the TLP task, we augment a structural mapping module to the existing TLP model architectures, which learns a mapping from graph structural (topological) features to memory embeddings. Our work paves the way for a memory-free foundation model for TLP.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However, GNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data and it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge, we explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across diverse Density Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold Molecular Dynamics. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for unobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of lightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials modeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formal Verification of Graph Convolutional Networks with Uncertain Node Features and Uncertain Graph Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15065v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks are becoming increasingly popular in the field of machine learning due to their unique ability to process data structured in graphs. They have also been applied in safety-critical environments where perturbations inherently occur. However, these perturbations require us to formally verify neural networks before their deployment in safety-critical environments as neural networks are prone to adversarial attacks. While there exists research on the formal verification of neural networks, there is no work verifying the robustness of generic graph convolutional network architectures with uncertainty in the node features and in the graph structure over multiple message-passing steps. This work addresses this research gap by explicitly preserving the non-convex dependencies of all elements in the underlying computations through reachability analysis with (matrix) polynomial zonotopes. We demonstrate our approach on three popular benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published at Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Balancing Graph Embedding Smoothness in Self-Supervised Learning via Information-Theoretic Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12011v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) in graphs has garnered significant attention, particularly in employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with pretext tasks initially designed for other domains, such as contrastive learning and feature reconstruction. However, it remains uncertain whether these methods effectively reflect essential graph properties, precisely representation similarity with its neighbors. We observe that existing methods position opposite ends of a spectrum driven by the graph embedding smoothness, with each end corresponding to outperformance on specific downstream tasks. Decomposing the SSL objective into three terms via an information-theoretic framework with a neighbor representation variable reveals that this polarization stems from an imbalance among the terms, which existing methods may not effectively maintain. Further insights suggest that balancing between the extremes can lead to improved performance across a wider range of downstream tasks. A framework, BSG (Balancing Smoothness in Graph SSL), introduces novel loss functions designed to supplement the representation quality in graph-based SSL by balancing the derived three terms: neighbor loss, minimal loss, and divergence loss. We present a theoretical analysis of the effects of these loss functions, highlighting their significance from both the SSL and graph smoothness perspectives. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets across node classification and link prediction consistently demonstrate that BSG achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.

This paper presents a novel approach combining a graph neural network-based exploration greedy policy with a safety shield to ensure safe navigation goal selection. The network is trained using reinforcement learning and the proximal policy optimization algorithm to maximize exploration efficiency while reducing the safety shield interventions. However, if the policy selects an infeasible action, the safety shield intervenes to choose the best feasible alternative, ensuring system consistency. Moreover, this paper proposes a reward function that includes a potential field based on the agent's proximity to unexplored regions and the expected information gain from reaching them. Overall, the approach investigated in this paper merges the benefits of the adaptability of reinforcement learning-driven exploration policies and the guarantee ensured by explicit safety mechanisms. Extensive evaluations in simulated environments demonstrate that the approach enables efficient and safe exploration in cluttered environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, submitted to the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

However, GNN methods for solving Weighted MaxSAT problems remain underdeveloped. The challenges arise from the non-linear dependency and sensitive objective function, which are caused by the non-uniform distribution of weights across clauses. In this paper, we present HyperSAT, a novel neural approach that employs an unsupervised hypergraph neural network model to solve Weighted MaxSAT problems. We propose a hypergraph representation for Weighted MaxSAT instances and design a cross-attention mechanism along with a shared representation constraint loss function to capture the logical interactions between positive and negative literal nodes in the hypergraph. Extensive experiments on various Weighted MaxSAT datasets demonstrate that HyperSAT achieves better performance than state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> |  |

Although these approaches show the potential of Transformers in capturing long-range graph topology information, issues concerning the quadratic complexity and high computing energy consumption severely limit the scalability of GTs on large-scale graphs. Recently, as brain-inspired neural networks, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), facilitate the development of graph representation learning methods with lower computational and storage overhead through the unique event-driven spiking neurons. Inspired by these characteristics, we propose a linear-time Graph Transformer using Spiking Vector Quantization (GT-SVQ) for node classification. GT-SVQ reconstructs codebooks based on rate coding outputs from spiking neurons, and injects the codebooks into self-attention blocks to aggregate global information in linear complexity. Besides, spiking vector quantization effectively alleviates codebook collapse and the reliance on complex machinery (distance measure, auxiliary loss, etc.) present in previous vector quantization-based graph learning methods. In experiments, we compare GT-SVQ with other state-of-the-art baselines on node classification datasets ranging from small to large. Experimental results show that GT-SVQ has achieved competitive performances on most datasets while maintaining up to 130x faster inference speed compared to other GTs.</p></details> | work in progress |

However, centralizing large volumes of real-world graph data for GNN training is often impractical due to privacy concerns, regulatory restrictions, and commercial competition. Federated learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm, offers a solution by preserving data privacy with collaborative model training. Despite progress in training huge vision and language models, federated learning for GNNs remains underexplored. To address this challenge, we present a novel method for federated learning on GNNs based on spectral GNNs equipped with neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) for better information capture, showing promising results across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Our approach effectively handles non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, while also achieving performance comparable to existing methods that only operate on IID data. It is designed to be privacy-preserving and bandwidth-optimized, making it suitable for real-world applications such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and fraud detection, which often involve complex, non-IID, and heterophilic graph structures. Our results in the area of federated learning on non-IID heterophilic graphs demonstrate significant improvements, while also achieving better performance on homophilic graphs. This work highlights the potential of federated learning in diverse and challenging graph settings.

Nevertheless, the etiological mechanisms underlying such relationships remain largely unclear, mainly due to difficulties in collecting relevant information. This study presents a novel, automated framework that leverages recent advancements of large language model (LLM) and natural language processing techniques to mine SDoH knowledge from extensive literature and integrate it with AD-related biological entities extracted from the general-purpose knowledge graph PrimeKG. Utilizing graph neural networks, we performed link prediction tasks to evaluate the resultant SDoH-augmented knowledge graph. Our framework shows promise for enhancing knowledge discovery in AD and can be generalized to other SDoH-related research areas, offering a new tool for exploring the impact of social determinants on health outcomes.

Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer a promising approach for efficient garment simulation. However, GNNs require extensive message-passing to propagate information such as physical forces and maintain contact awareness across the entire garment mesh, which becomes computationally inefficient at higher resolutions. To address this, we devise a novel GNN-based mesh learning framework with two key components to extend the message-passing range with minimal overhead, namely the Laplacian-Smoothed Dual Message-Passing (LSDMP) and the Geodesic Self-Attention (GSA) modules. LSDMP enhances message-passing with a Laplacian features smoothing process, which efficiently propagates the impact of each vertex to nearby vertices. Concurrently, GSA introduces geodesic distance embeddings to represent the spatial relationship between vertices and utilises attention mechanisms to capture global mesh information. The two modules operate in parallel to ensure both short- and long-range mesh modelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, requiring fewer layers and lower inference latency.</p></details> |  |

However, this introduces a potential privacy problem as this data can be tracked and analysed, which can reveal user-behaviour information. A user behaviour analysis pipeline was proposed to present how this type of information can be extracted and analysed to identify separate behavioural clusters that can describe how users behave in the game. The pipeline starts with the collection of transaction data, involving smart contracts, that is collected from a blockchain-based game called Planet IX. Both the raw transaction information and the transaction events are considered in the data collection. From this data, separate game actions can be formed and those are leveraged to present how and when the users conducted their in-game activities in the form of user flows. An extended version of these user flows also presents how the Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are being leveraged in the user actions. The latter is given as input for a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to provide graph embeddings for these flows which then can be leveraged by clustering algorithms to cluster user behaviours into separate behavioural clusters. We benchmark and compare well-known clustering algorithms as a part of the proposed method. The user behaviour clusters were analysed and visualised in a graph format. It was found that behavioural information can be extracted regarding the users that belong to these clusters. Such information can be exploited by malicious users to their advantage. To demonstrate this, a privacy threat model was also presented based on the results that correspond to multiple potentially affected areas.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Blockchain: Research and Applications</p></details> |

We propose H$^3$GNNs, an end-to-end self-supervised learning framework that harmonizes both structural properties through two key innovations: (i) Joint Structural Node Encoding. We embed nodes into a unified space combining linear and non-linear feature projections with K-hop structural representations via a Weighted Graph Convolution Network(WGCN). A cross-attention mechanism enhances awareness and adaptability to heterophily and homophily. (ii) Self-Supervised Learning Using Teacher-Student Predictive Architectures with Node-Difficulty Driven Dynamic Masking Strategies. We use a teacher-student model, the student sees the masked input graph and predicts node features inferred by the teacher that sees the full input graph in the joint encoding space. To enhance learning difficulty, we introduce two novel node-predictive-difficulty-based masking strategies. Experiments on seven benchmarks (four heterophily datasets and three homophily datasets) confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of H$^3$GNNs across diverse graph types. Our H$^3$GNNs achieves overall state-of-the-art performance on the four heterophily datasets, while retaining on-par performance to previous state-of-the-art methods on the three homophily datasets.</p></details> |  |

When certain entities exist across multiple systems simultaneously, unveiling their corresponding relationships across the networks becomes crucial. This problem, known as network alignment, holds significant importance. It enhances our understanding of complex system structures and behaviours, facilitates the validation and extension of theoretical physics research about studying complex systems, and fosters diverse practical applications across various fields. However, due to variations in the structure, characteristics, and properties of complex networks across different fields, the study of network alignment is often isolated within each domain, with even the terminologies and concepts lacking uniformity. This review comprehensively summarizes the latest advancements in network alignment research, focusing on analyzing network alignment characteristics and progress in various domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, computational linguistics and privacy protection. It provides a detailed analysis of various methods' implementation principles, processes, and performance differences, including structure consistency-based methods, network embedding-based methods, and graph neural network-based (GNN-based) methods.

This paper introduces an innovative multimodal feature learning framework for personality analysis in short video clips. For visual processing, we construct a facial graph and design a Geo-based two-stream network incorporating an attention mechanism, leveraging both Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to capture static facial expressions. Additionally, ResNet18 and VGGFace networks are employed to extract global scene and facial appearance features at the frame level. To capture dynamic temporal information, we integrate a BiGRU with a temporal attention module for extracting salient frame representations. To enhance the model's robustness, we incorporate the VGGish CNN for audio-based features and XLM-Roberta for text-based features. Finally, a multimodal channel attention mechanism is introduced to integrate different modalities, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression model is used to predict personality traits. Experimental results confirm that our proposed framework surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in performance.</p></details> |  |

The results can then be further improved with re-ranking methods that re-order the top scoring images. However, existing methods focus on re-ranking based on the same image descriptors that were used for the initial retrieval, which we argue provides limited additional signal. In this work we propose Generalized Contextual Similarity Aggregation (GCSA), which is a graph neural network-based re-ranking method that, in addition to the visual descriptors, can leverage other types of available side information. This can for example be other sensor data (such as signal strength of nearby WiFi or BlueTooth endpoints) or geometric properties such as camera poses for database images. In many applications this information is already present or can be acquired with low effort. Our architecture leverages the concept of affinity vectors to allow for a shared encoding of the heterogeneous multi-modal input. Two large-scale datasets, covering both outdoor and indoor localization scenarios, are utilized for training and evaluation. In experiments we show significant improvement not only on image retrieval metrics, but also for the downstream visual localization task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis (SCIA) 2025</p></details> |

However, attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors and their risks have rarely been studied, thereby leaving potential threats unaddressed. Recent findings suggest that frauds are increasingly organized as gangs or groups. In this work, we design attack scenarios where fraud gangs aim to make their fraud nodes misclassified as benign by camouflaging their illicit activities in collusion. Based on these scenarios, we study adversarial attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors by simulating attacks of fraud gangs in three real-world fraud cases: spam reviews, fake news, and medical insurance frauds. We define these attacks as multi-target graph injection attacks and propose MonTi, a transformer-based Multi-target one-Time graph injection attack model. MonTi simultaneously generates attributes and edges of all attack nodes with a transformer encoder, capturing interdependencies between attributes and edges more effectively than most existing graph injection attack methods that generate these elements sequentially. Additionally, MonTi adaptively allocates the degree budget for each attack node to explore diverse injection structures involving target, candidate, and attack nodes, unlike existing methods that fix the degree budget across all attack nodes. Experiments show that MonTi outperforms the state-of-the-art graph injection attack methods on five real-world graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, 12 tables, The 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025)</p></details> |

Recent advances in protein structure prediction and machine learning-driven molecule generation offer a promising opportunity to accelerate drug discovery. However, practical guidance on selecting and integrating these models into real-world pipelines remains limited. In this study, we develop an end-to-end, artificial intelligence-guided antibiotic discovery pipeline that spans target identification to compound realization. We leverage structure-based clustering across predicted proteomes of multiple pathogens to identify conserved, essential, and non-human-homologous targets. We then systematically evaluate six leading 3D-structure-aware generative models$\unicode{x2014}$spanning diffusion, autoregressive, graph neural network, and language model architectures$\unicode{x2014}$on their usability, chemical validity, and biological relevance. Rigorous post-processing filters and commercial analogue searches reduce over 100 000 generated compounds to a focused, synthesizable set. Our results highlight DeepBlock and TamGen as top performers across diverse criteria, while also revealing critical trade-offs between model complexity, usability, and output quality.

Towards recognizing social media recommender systems with missing recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11000v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media plays a crucial role in shaping society, often amplifying polarization and spreading misinformation. These effects stem from complex dynamics involving user interactions, individual traits, and recommender algorithms driving content selection. Recommender systems, which significantly shape the content users see and decisions they make, offer an opportunity for intervention and regulation. However, assessing their impact is challenging due to algorithmic opacity and limited data availability. To effectively model user decision-making, it is crucial to recognize the recommender system adopted by the platform. This work introduces a method for Automatic Recommender Recognition using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), based solely on network structure and observed behavior. To infer the hidden recommender, we first train a Recommender Neutral User model (RNU) using a GNN and an adapted hindsight academic network recommender, aiming to reduce reliance on the actual recommender in the data. We then generate several Recommender Hypothesis-specific Synthetic Datasets (RHSD) by combining the RNU with different known recommenders, producing ground truths for testing. Finally, we train Recommender Hypothesis-specific User models (RHU) under various hypotheses and compare each candidate with the original used to generate the RHSD. Our approach enables accurate detection of hidden recommenders and their influence on user behavior. Unlike audit-based methods, it captures system behavior directly, without ad hoc experiments that often fail to reflect real platforms. This study provides insights into how recommenders shape behavior, aiding efforts to reduce polarization and misinformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RLDM 2025</p></details> |

In the graph domain, however, capturing and transferring structural information across different graph domains remains challenging, primarily due to the inherent differences in topological patterns across various contexts. Additionally, most existing models struggle to capture the complexity of rich graph structures, leading to inadequate exploration of the embedding space. To address these challenges, we propose GFSE, a universal graph structural encoder designed to capture transferable structural patterns across diverse domains such as molecular graphs, social networks, and citation networks. GFSE is the first cross-domain graph structural encoder pre-trained with multiple self-supervised learning objectives. Built on a Graph Transformer, GFSE incorporates attention mechanisms informed by graph inductive bias, enabling it to encode intricate multi-level and fine-grained topological features. The pre-trained GFSE produces generic and theoretically expressive positional and structural encoding for graphs, which can be seamlessly integrated with various downstream graph feature encoders, including graph neural networks for vectorized features and Large Language Models for text-attributed graphs. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate GFSE's capability to significantly enhance the model's performance while requiring substantially less task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, GFSE achieves state-of-the-art performance in 81.6% evaluated cases, spanning diverse graph models and datasets, highlighting its potential as a powerful and versatile encoder for graph-structured data.</p></details> |  |

Existing GNN models focus on prediction accuracy, frequently overlooking fairness across different degree groups. To addressthis issue, we propose a novel GNN framework, namely Fairness- Aware Asymmetric Contrastive Ensemble (FairACE), which inte-grates asymmetric contrastive learning with adversarial training to improve degree fairness. FairACE captures one-hop local neighborhood information and two-hop monophily similarity to create fairer node representations and employs a degree fairness regulator to balance performance between high-degree and low-degree nodes. During model training, a novel group-balanced fairness loss is proposed to minimize classification disparities across degree groups. In addition, we also propose a novel fairness metric, the Accuracy Distribution Gap (ADG), which can quantitatively assess and ensure equitable performance across different degree-based node groups. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FairACE significantly improves degree fairness metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art GNN models.</p></details> |  |

Conventional computational methods for identifying such materials are resource-intensive and not easily scalable. Recently, universal interatomic potential models have been developed using equivariant graph neural networks. These models are trained on extensive datasets of first-principles force and energy calculations. One can achieve significant computational advantages by leveraging them as the foundation for traditional methods of assessing the ionic conductivity, such as molecular dynamics or nudged elastic band techniques. However, the generalization error from model inference on diverse atomic structures arising in such calculations can compromise the reliability of the results. In this work, we propose an approach for the quick and reliable screening of ionic conductors through the analysis of a universal interatomic potential. Our method incorporates a set of heuristic structure descriptors that effectively employ the rich knowledge of the underlying model while requiring minimal generalization capabilities. Using our descriptors, we rank lithium-containing materials in the Materials Project database according to their expected ionic conductivity. Eight out of the ten highest-ranked materials are confirmed to be superionic at room temperature in first-principles calculations.

These models facilitate the understanding of matter and the discovery of new molecules and materials. In contrast to GNNs operating on a large homogeneous graphs, GNNs used by CFMs process a large number of geometric graphs of varying sizes, requiring different optimization strategies than those developed for large homogeneous GNNs. This paper presents optimizations for two critical phases of CFM training: data distribution and model training, targeting MACE - a state-of-the-art CFM. We address the challenge of load balancing in data distribution by formulating it as a multi-objective bin packing problem. We propose an iterative algorithm that provides a highly effective, fast, and practical solution, ensuring efficient data distribution. For the training phase, we identify symmetric tensor contraction as the key computational kernel in MACE and optimize this kernel to improve the overall performance. Our combined approach of balanced data distribution and kernel optimization significantly enhances the training process of MACE. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial speedup, reducing per-epoch execution time for training from 12 to 2 minutes on 740 GPUs with a 2.6M sample dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 34th ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[MatterTune: An Integrated, User-Friendly Platform for Fine-Tuning Atomistic Foundation Models to Accelerate Materials Simulation and Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10655v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric machine learning models such as graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in recent years in chemical and materials science research for applications such as high-throughput virtual screening and atomistic simulations. The success of these models can be attributed to their ability to effectively learn latent representations of atomic structures directly from the training data. Conversely, this also results in high data requirements for these models, hindering their application to problems which are data sparse which are common in this domain. To address this limitation, there is a growing development in the area of pre-trained machine learning models which have learned general, fundamental, geometric relationships in atomistic data, and which can then be fine-tuned to much smaller application-specific datasets. In particular, models which are pre-trained on diverse, large-scale atomistic datasets have shown impressive generalizability and flexibility to downstream applications, and are increasingly referred to as atomistic foundation models. To leverage the untapped potential of these foundation models, we introduce MatterTune, a modular and extensible framework that provides advanced fine-tuning capabilities and seamless integration of atomistic foundation models into downstream materials informatics and simulation workflows, thereby lowering the barriers to adoption and facilitating diverse applications in materials science. In its current state, MatterTune supports a number of state-of-the-art foundation models such as ORB, MatterSim, JMP, and EquformerV2, and hosts a wide range of features including a modular and flexible design, distributed and customizable fine-tuning, broad support for downstream informatics tasks, and more.</p></details> |  |
| **[Invariance Matters: Empowering Social Recommendation via Graph Invariant Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10432v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based social recommendation systems have shown significant promise in enhancing recommendation performance, particularly in addressing the issue of data sparsity in user behaviors. Typically, these systems leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture user preferences by incorporating high-order social influences from observed social networks. However, existing graph-based social recommendations often overlook the fact that social networks are inherently noisy, containing task-irrelevant relationships that can hinder accurate user preference learning. The removal of these redundant social relations is crucial, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth. In this paper, we approach the social denoising problem from the perspective of graph invariant learning and propose a novel method, Social Graph Invariant Learning(SGIL). Specifically,SGIL aims to uncover stable user preferences within the input social graph, thereby enhancing the robustness of graph-based social recommendation systems. To achieve this goal, SGIL first simulates multiple noisy social environments through graph generators. It then seeks to learn environment-invariant user preferences by minimizing invariant risk across these environments. To further promote diversity in the generated social environments, we employ an adversarial training strategy to simulate more potential social noisy distributions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SGIL. The code is available at https://github.com/yimutianyang/SIGIR2025-SGIL.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the effect of using different coarse-grained graph resolutions, obtained through the Laplacian renormalization group theory, on node classification tasks. At the theory's core is grouping nodes connected by significant information flow at a given time scale. Representations of the graph at different scales encode interaction information at different ranges. We specifically experiment using representations at the characteristic scale of the graph's mesoscopic structures. We provide the models with the original graph and the graph represented at the characteristic resolution scale and compare them to models that can only access the original graph. Our results showed that models with access to both the original graph and the characteristic scale graph can achieve statistically significant improvements in test accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face three main challenges: 1) Insufficient use of topological patterns in circuit graphs reduces prediction accuracy; 2) Data scarcity due to the complexity of annotations hinders model generalization; 3) Limited adaptability to various netlist formats. We propose GNN-ACLP, a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based framework featuring three innovations to tackle these challenges. First, we introduce the SEAL (Subgraphs, Embeddings, and Attributes for Link Prediction) framework and achieve port-level accuracy in circuit link prediction. Second, we propose Netlist Babel Fish, a netlist format conversion tool leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language model (LLM) to enhance the compatibility of netlist formats. Finally, we construct SpiceNetlist, a comprehensive dataset that contains 775 annotated circuits across 10 different classes of components. The experimental results demonstrate an improvement of 15.05% on the SpiceNetlist dataset and 12.01% on the Image2Net dataset over the existing approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data will be made available on request</p></details> |

While most research has centered on static graphs, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic, temporally evolving graphs, motivating the need for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph (CTDG) models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of Graph Representation Learning (GRL) on CTDGs with a focus on Self-Supervised Representation Learning (SSRL). We introduce a novel theoretical framework that analyzes the expressivity of CTDG models through an Information-Flow (IF) lens, quantifying their ability to propagate and encode temporal and structural information. Leveraging this framework, we categorize existing CTDG methods based on their suitability for different graph types and application scenarios. Within the same scope, we examine the design of SSRL methods tailored to CTDGs, such as predictive and contrastive approaches, highlighting their potential to mitigate the reliance on labeled data. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical insights, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of various methods across long-range, bi-partite and community-based graphs. This work offers both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for selecting and developing CTDG models, advancing the understanding of GRL in dynamic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR.

| **[Unleashing Expert Opinion from Social Media for Stock Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10078v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While stock prediction task traditionally relies on volume-price and fundamental data to predict the return ratio or price movement trend, sentiment factors derived from social media platforms such as StockTwits offer a complementary and useful source of real-time market information. However, we find that most social media posts, along with the public sentiment they reflect, provide limited value for trading predictions due to their noisy nature. To tackle this, we propose a novel dynamic expert tracing algorithm that filters out non-informative posts and identifies both true and inverse experts whose consistent predictions can serve as valuable trading signals. Our approach achieves significant improvements over existing expert identification methods in stock trend prediction. However, when using binary expert predictions to predict the return ratio, similar to all other expert identification methods, our approach faces a common challenge of signal sparsity with expert signals cover only about 4% of all stock-day combinations in our dataset. To address this challenge, we propose a dual graph attention neural network that effectively propagates expert signals across related stocks, enabling accurate prediction of return ratios and significantly increasing signal coverage. Empirical results show that our propagated expert-based signals not only exhibit strong predictive power independently but also work synergistically with traditional financial features. These combined signals significantly outperform representative baseline models in all quant-related metrics including predictive accuracy, return metrics, and correlation metrics, resulting in more robust investment strategies. We hope this work inspires further research into leveraging social media data for enhancing quantitative investment strategies.

However, the large data centres where cloud computing services are hosted consume significant amounts of electricity annually due to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) components. This issue is exacerbated by the increasing deployment of large artificial intelligence (AI) models, which often rely on distributed data centres, thereby significantly impacting the global environment. This study proposes the COUNTER model, designed for sustainable cloud resource management. COUNTER is integrated with cluster graph neural networks and evaluated in a simulated cloud environment, aiming to reduce energy consumption while maintaining quality of service parameters.

| **[Towards Unbiased Federated Graph Learning: Label and Topology Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09963v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) enables privacy-preserving, distributed training of graph neural networks without sharing raw data. Among its approaches, subgraph-FL has become the dominant paradigm, with most work focused on improving overall node classification accuracy. However, these methods often overlook fairness due to the complexity of node features, labels, and graph structures. In particular, they perform poorly on nodes with disadvantaged properties, such as being in the minority class within subgraphs or having heterophilous connections (neighbors with dissimilar labels or misleading features). This reveals a critical issue: high accuracy can mask degraded performance on structurally or semantically marginalized nodes. To address this, we advocate for two fairness goals: (1) improving representation of minority class nodes for class-wise fairness and (2) mitigating topological bias from heterophilous connections for topology-aware fairness. We propose FairFGL, a novel framework that enhances fairness through fine-grained graph mining and collaborative learning. On the client side, the History-Preserving Module prevents overfitting to dominant local classes, while the Majority Alignment Module refines representations of heterophilous majority-class nodes. The Gradient Modification Module transfers minority-class knowledge from structurally favorable clients to improve fairness. On the server side, FairFGL uploads only the most influenced subset of parameters to reduce communication costs and better reflect local distributions. A cluster-based aggregation strategy reconciles conflicting updates and curbs global majority dominance . Extensive evaluations on eight benchmarks show FairFGL significantly improves minority-group performance , achieving up to a 22.62 percent Macro-F1 gain while enhancing convergence over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | Under Review |

The problem is framed as a constrained statistical learning task, where each network node operates using only local information. Opportunistic routing exploits the broadcast nature of wireless communication to dynamically select optimal forwarding nodes, enabling the information to reach the destination through multiple relay nodes simultaneously. To solve this, we propose a State-Augmentation (SA) based distributed optimization approach aimed at maximizing the total information handled by the source nodes in the network. The problem formulation leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which perform graph convolutions based on the topological connections between network nodes. Using an unsupervised learning paradigm, we extract routing policies from the GNN architecture, enabling optimal decisions for source nodes across various flows. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance when training a GNN-parameterized model, particularly when compared to baseline algorithms. Additionally, applying the method to real-world network topologies and wireless ad-hoc network test beds validates its effectiveness, highlighting the robustness and transferability of GNNs.</p></details> |  |

This variability necessitates the deployment of advanced computational methods to integrate and interpret these diverse datasets within a cohesive analytical framework. In our research, we amalgamate functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural MRI into a cohesive framework. This integration capitalizes on the unique strengths of each modality and their inherent interconnections, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the brain's connectivity and anatomical characteristics. Utilizing the Glasser atlas for parcellation, we integrate imaging derived features from various modalities: functional connectivity from fMRI, structural connectivity from DTI, and anatomical features from sMRI within consistent regions. Our approach incorporates a masking strategy to differentially weight neural connections, thereby facilitating a holistic amalgamation of multimodal imaging data. This technique enhances interpretability at connectivity level, transcending traditional analyses centered on singular regional attributes. The model is applied to the Human Connectome Project's Development study to elucidate the associations between multimodal imaging and cognitive functions throughout youth. The analysis demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and uncovers crucial anatomical features and essential neural connections, deepening our understanding of brain structure and function.</p></details> |  |

Identifying biomarkers for personalized treatment is crucial. While immune cells play a key role in IBD, accurately identifying ulcer regions in whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for characterizing these cells and exploring potential therapeutics. Multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches have advanced WSI analysis but they lack spatial context awareness. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised model called DomainGCN that employs a graph convolution neural network (GCN) and incorporates domain-specific knowledge of ulcer features, specifically, the presence of epithelium, lymphocytes, and debris for WSI-level ulcer prediction in IBD. We demonstrate that DomainGCN outperforms various state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods and show the added value of domain knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work accepted at ISBI 2025</p></details> |

Accurate modeling of fluoride-related health risks, such as dental fluorosis, requires spatially aware learning frameworks capable of capturing both geographic and semantic heterogeneity. In this work, we propose Spatially Directional Dual-Attention Graph Attention Network (SDD-GAT), a novel spatial graph neural network designed for fine-grained health risk prediction. SDD-GAT introduces a dual-graph architecture that disentangles geographic proximity and attribute similarity, and incorporates a directional attention mechanism that explicitly encodes spatial orientation and distance into the message passing process. To further enhance spatial coherence, we introduce a spatial smoothness regularization term that enforces consistency in predictions across neighboring locations. We evaluate SDD-GAT on a large-scale dataset covering over 50,000 fluoride monitoring samples and fluorosis records across Guizhou Province, China. Results show that SDD-GAT significantly outperforms traditional models and state-of-the-art GNNs in both regression and classification tasks, while also exhibiting improved spatial autocorrelation as measured by Moran's I. Our framework provides a generalizable foundation for spatial health risk modeling and geospatial learning under complex environmental settings.</p></details> |  |

This pressing challenge is further exacerbated by the increasing needs of an aging population, the oversubscription of existing services, and the lack of effective solution methods. This study addresses the intricacies of service scheduling, by jointly optimizing rider trip planning and crew scheduling for a complex dynamic mobility service. The resulting optimization problems are extremely challenging computationally for state-of-the-art methods. To address this fundamental gap, this paper introduces the Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling Problem (JRTPCSSP) and a novel solution method, called Attention and Gated GNN-Informed Column Generation (AGGNNI-CG), that hybridizes column generation and machine learning to obtain near-optimal solutions to the JRTPCSSP with real-life constraints of the application. The key idea of the machine-learning component is to dramatically reduce the number of paths to explore in the pricing problem, accelerating the most time-consuming component of the column generation. The machine learning component is a graph neural network with an attention mechanism and a gated architecture, which is particularly suited to cater for the different input sizes coming from daily operations. AGGNNI-CG has been applied to a challenging, real-world dataset from the Paratransit system of Chatham County in Georgia. It produces substantial improvements compared to the baseline column generation approach, which typically cannot produce high-quality feasible solutions in reasonable time on large-scale complex instances. AGGNNI-CG also produces significant improvements in service quality compared to the existing system.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods struggle with challenges arising from multimodal data, such as dimensional disparities, mismatched target counts, vessel scale variations, occlusions, and asynchronous data streams from systems like the automatic identification system (AIS) and closed-circuit television (CCTV). Traditional multi-target association methods often struggle with these complexities, particularly in densely trafficked waterways. To overcome these issues, we propose a graph learning-driven multi-vessel association (GMvA) method tailored for maritime multimodal data fusion. By integrating AIS and CCTV data, GMvA leverages time series learning and graph neural networks to capture the spatiotemporal features of vessel trajectories effectively. To enhance feature representation, the proposed method incorporates temporal graph attention and spatiotemporal attention, effectively capturing both local and global vessel interactions. Furthermore, a multi-layer perceptron-based uncertainty fusion module computes robust similarity scores, and the Hungarian algorithm is adopted to ensure globally consistent and accurate target matching. Extensive experiments on real-world maritime datasets confirm that GMvA delivers superior accuracy and robustness in multi-target association, outperforming existing methods even in challenging scenarios with high vessel density and incomplete or unevenly distributed AIS and CCTV data.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose the Hypergraph Vision Transformer (HgVT), which incorporates a hierarchical bipartite hypergraph structure into the vision transformer framework to capture higher-order semantic relationships while maintaining computational efficiency. HgVT leverages population and diversity regularization for dynamic hypergraph construction without clustering, and expert edge pooling to enhance semantic extraction and facilitate graph-based image retrieval. Empirical results demonstrate that HgVT achieves strong performance on image classification and retrieval, positioning it as an efficient framework for semantic-based vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Traditional GNNs follow a message passing scheme that can effectively utilize local and structural information. However, the phenomena of over-smoothing and over-squashing limit the receptive field in message passing processes. Graph Transformers were introduced to address these issues, achieving a global receptive field but suffering from the noise of irrelevant nodes and loss of structural information. Therefore, drawing inspiration from fine-grained token-based representation learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we propose the Structure-aware Multi-token Graph Transformer (Tokenphormer), which generates multiple tokens to effectively capture local and structural information and explore global information at different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first introduce the walk-token generated by mixed walks consisting of four walk types to explore the graph and capture structure and contextual information flexibly. To ensure local and global information coverage, we also introduce the SGPM-token (obtained through the Self-supervised Graph Pre-train Model, SGPM) and the hop-token, extending the length and density limit of the walk-token, respectively. Finally, these expressive tokens are fed into the Transformer model to learn node representations collaboratively. Experimental results demonstrate that the capability of the proposed Tokenphormer can achieve state-of-the-art performance on node classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Despite this, two primary challenges persist: heterogeneity and heterophily. Each of these two challenges can significantly hinder the performance of GNNs. Heterogeneity refers to a graph with multiple types of nodes or edges, while heterophily refers to the fact that connected nodes are more likely to have dissimilar attributes or labels. Although there have been few works studying heterogeneous heterophilic graphs, they either only consider the heterophily of specific meta-paths and lack expressiveness, or have high expressiveness but fail to exploit high-order neighbors. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Heterophilic Spectral Graph Neural Network (H2SGNN), which employs two modules: local independent filtering and global hybrid filtering. Local independent filtering adaptively learns node representations under different homophily, while global hybrid filtering exploits high-order neighbors to learn more possible meta-paths. Extensive experiments are conducted on four datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed H2SGNN, which achieves superior performance with fewer parameters and memory consumption.

However, most HGP methods suffer not only from lack of considering global topology of the graph and focusing on the feature learning aspect, but also they do not align local and global features since graphs should inherently be analyzed in a multiscale way. LGRPool is proposed in the present paper as a HGP in the framework of expectation maximization in machine learning that aligns local and global aspects of message passing with each other using a regularizer to force the global topological information to be inline with the local message passing at different scales through the representations at different layers of HGP. Experimental results on some graph classification benchmarks show that it slightly outperforms some baselines.</p></details> | f tables, 2 figures |

Existing solutions for the design space exploration (DSE) adopt either heuristic methods, lacking essential information for further optimization potential, or predictive models, missing sufficient generalization due to the time-consuming nature of HLS and the exponential growth of the design space. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Inverse Design for HLS (DID4HLS), a novel approach that integrates graph neural networks and generative models. DID4HLS iteratively optimizes hardware designs aimed at compute-intensive algorithms by learning conditional distributions of design features from post-HLS data. Compared to four state-of-the-art DSE baselines, our method achieved an average improvement of 42.8% on average distance to reference set (ADRS) compared to the best-performing baselines across six benchmarks, while demonstrating high robustness and efficiency.

Traditional path-planning algorithms struggle in these scenarios, particularly when prior information is not available. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and transformer-based mechanisms for enhanced multi-agent coordination and collective task execution. Our approach leverages GNNs to model agent-agent and agent-goal interactions through adaptive graph construction, enabling efficient information aggregation and decision-making under constrained communication. A transformer-based message-passing mechanism, augmented with edge-feature-enhanced attention, captures complex interaction patterns, while a Double Deep Q-Network (Double DQN) with prioritized experience replay optimizes agent policies in partially observable environments. This integration is carefully designed to address specific requirements of multi-agent navigation, such as scalability, adaptability, and efficient task execution.

Unlike traditional machine learning methods that rely solely on numerical features of transaction records, this approach constructs heterogeneous transaction graphs. These graphs incorporate multiple node types, including users, merchants, and transactions. By leveraging graph neural networks, the model captures higher-order transaction relationships. A Graph Attention Mechanism is employed to dynamically assign weights to different transaction relationships. Additionally, a Temporal Decay Mechanism is integrated to enhance the model's sensitivity to time-related fraud patterns. To address the scarcity of fraudulent transaction samples, this study applies SMOTE oversampling and Cost-sensitive Learning. These techniques strengthen the model's ability to identify fraudulent transactions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing GNN models, including GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE, on the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset. The model achieves notable improvements in both accuracy and OC-ROC. Future research may explore the integration of dynamic graph neural networks and reinforcement learning. Such advancements could enhance the real-time adaptability of fraud detection systems and provide more intelligent solutions for financial risk control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Opinion de-polarization of social networks with GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09404v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, social media is the ground for political debate and exchange of opinions. There is a significant amount of research that suggests that social media are highly polarized. A phenomenon that is commonly observed is the echo chamber structure, where users are organized in polarized communities and form connections only with similar-minded individuals, limiting themselves to consume specific content. In this paper we explore a way to decrease the polarization of networks with two echo chambers. Particularly, we observe that if some users adopt a moderate opinion about a topic, the polarization of the network decreases. Based on this observation, we propose an efficient algorithm to identify a good set of K users, such that if they adopt a moderate stance around a topic, the polarization is minimized. Our algorithm employs a Graph Neural Network and thus it can handle large graphs more effectively than other approaches</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Laws of Graph Neural Networks for Atomistic Materials Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08112v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Atomistic materials modeling is a critical task with wide-ranging applications, from drug discovery to materials science, where accurate predictions of the target material property can lead to significant advancements in scientific discovery. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) represent the state-of-the-art approach for modeling atomistic material data thanks to their capacity to capture complex relational structures. While machine learning performance has historically improved with larger models and datasets, GNNs for atomistic materials modeling remain relatively small compared to large language models (LLMs), which leverage billions of parameters and terabyte-scale datasets to achieve remarkable performance in their respective domains. To address this gap, we explore the scaling limits of GNNs for atomistic materials modeling by developing a foundational model with billions of parameters, trained on extensive datasets in terabyte-scale. Our approach incorporates techniques from LLM libraries to efficiently manage large-scale data and models, enabling both effective training and deployment of these large-scale GNN models. This work addresses three fundamental questions in scaling GNNs: the potential for scaling GNN model architectures, the effect of dataset size on model accuracy, and the applicability of LLM-inspired techniques to GNN architectures. Specifically, the outcomes of this study include (1) insights into the scaling laws for GNNs, highlighting the relationship between model size, dataset volume, and accuracy, (2) a foundational GNN model optimized for atomistic materials modeling, and (3) a GNN codebase enhanced with advanced LLM-based training techniques. Our findings lay the groundwork for large-scale GNNs with billions of parameters and terabyte-scale datasets, establishing a scalable pathway for future advancements in atomistic materials modeling.</p></details> | Accepted by DAC'25 |

| **[Multi-view Hybrid Graph Convolutional Network for Volume-to-mesh Reconstruction in Cardiovascular MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13706v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is emerging as a crucial tool to examine cardiac morphology and function. Essential to this endeavour are anatomical 3D surface and volumetric meshes derived from CMR images, which facilitate computational anatomy studies, biomarker discovery, and in-silico simulations. Traditional approaches typically follow complex multi-step pipelines, first segmenting images and then reconstructing meshes, making them time-consuming and prone to error propagation. In response, we introduce HybridVNet, a novel architecture for direct image-to-mesh extraction seamlessly integrating standard convolutional neural networks with graph convolutions, which we prove can efficiently handle surface and volumetric meshes by encoding them as graph structures. To further enhance accuracy, we propose a multi-view HybridVNet architecture which processes both long axis and short axis CMR, showing that it can increase the performance of cardiac MR mesh generation. Our model combines traditional convolutional networks with variational graph generative models, deep supervision and mesh-specific regularisation. Experiments on a comprehensive dataset from the UK Biobank confirm the potential of HybridVNet to significantly advance cardiac imaging and computational cardiology by efficiently generating high-fidelity meshes from CMR images. Multi-view HybridVNet outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements of up to $\sim$27\% reduction in Mean Contour Distance (from 1.86 mm to 1.35 mm for the LV Myocardium), up to $\sim$18\% improvement in Hausdorff distance (from 4.74 mm to 3.89mm, for the LV Endocardium), and up to $\sim$8\% in Dice Coefficient (from 0.78 to 0.84, for the LV Myocardium), highlighting its superior accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soybean Disease Detection via Interpretable Hybrid CNN-GNN: Integrating MobileNetV2 and GraphSAGE with Cross-Modal Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01284v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soybean leaf disease detection is critical for agricultural productivity but faces challenges due to visually similar symptoms and limited interpretability in conventional methods. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in spatial feature extraction, they often neglect inter-image relational dependencies, leading to misclassifications. This paper proposes an interpretable hybrid Sequential CNN-Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that synergizes MobileNetV2 for localized feature extraction and GraphSAGE for relational modeling. The framework constructs a graph where nodes represent leaf images, with edges defined by cosine similarity-based adjacency matrices and adaptive neighborhood sampling. This design captures fine-grained lesion features and global symptom patterns, addressing inter-class similarity challenges. Cross-modal interpretability is achieved via Grad-CAM and Eigen-CAM visualizations, generating heatmaps to highlight disease-influential regions. Evaluated on a dataset of ten soybean leaf diseases, the model achieves $97.16\%$ accuracy, surpassing standalone CNNs ($\le95.04\%$) and traditional machine learning models ($\le77.05\%$). Ablation studies validate the sequential architecture's superiority over parallel or single-model configurations. With only 2.3 million parameters, the lightweight MobileNetV2-GraphSAGE combination ensures computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. The proposed approach bridges the gap between accurate classification and practical applicability, offering a robust, interpretable tool for agricultural diagnostics while advancing CNN-GNN integration in plant pathology research.</p></details> |  |

Traditional machine learning models remain effective in resource-limited environments due to their efficiency, requiring fewer parameters and less computational time. However, handling short and highly imbalanced datasets remains challenging. In this study, we propose the fusion of a Contrastive Attentive Graph Network and Graph Attention Network (CAGN-GAT Fusion) and benchmark it against 15 other models, including both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and traditional ML models. Our evaluation is conducted on four benchmark datasets (KDD-CUP-1999, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017) using a short and proportionally imbalanced dataset with a constant size of 5000 samples to ensure fairness in comparison. Results show that CAGN-GAT Fusion demonstrates stable and competitive accuracy, recall, and F1-score, even though it does not achieve the highest performance in every dataset. Our analysis also highlights the impact of adaptive graph construction techniques, including small changes in connections (edge perturbation) and selective hiding of features (feature masking), improving detection performance. The findings confirm that GNNs, particularly CAGN-GAT Fusion, are robust and computationally efficient, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments. Future work will explore GraphSAGE layers and multiview graph construction techniques to further enhance adaptability and detection accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 38th International Conference on Industrial, Engineering & Other Applications of Applied Intelligent Systems (IEA/AIE 2025), Kitakyushu, Japan, Jul 2025</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing Equivariance: Modeling Turbulence with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07741v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a novel methodology for turbulence modeling in Large Eddy Simulation (LES) based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which embeds the discrete rotational, reflectional and translational symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations into the model architecture. In addition, suitable invariant input and output spaces are derived that allow the GNN models to be embedded seamlessly into the LES framework to obtain a symmetry-preserving simulation setup. The suitability of the proposed approach is investigated for two canonical test cases: Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (HIT) and turbulent channel flow. For both cases, GNN models are trained successfully in actual simulations using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to ensure that the models are consistent with the underlying LES formulation and discretization. It is demonstrated for the HIT case that the resulting GNN-based LES scheme recovers rotational and reflectional equivariance up to machine precision in actual simulations. At the same time, the stability and accuracy remain on par with non-symmetry-preserving machine learning models that fail to obey these properties. The same modeling strategy translates well to turbulent channel flow, where the GNN model successfully learns the more complex flow physics and is able to recover the turbulent statistics and Reynolds stresses. It is shown that the GNN model learns a zonal modeling strategy with distinct behaviors in the near-wall and outer regions. The proposed approach thus demonstrates the potential of GNNs for turbulence modeling, especially in the context of LES and RL.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[GOLD: Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection via Implicit Adversarial Latent Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05780v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite graph neural networks' (GNNs) great success in modelling graph-structured data, out-of-distribution (OOD) test instances still pose a great challenge for current GNNs. One of the most effective techniques to detect OOD nodes is to expose the detector model with an additional OOD node-set, yet the extra OOD instances are often difficult to obtain in practice. Recent methods for image data address this problem using OOD data synthesis, typically relying on pre-trained generative models like Stable Diffusion. However, these approaches require vast amounts of additional data, as well as one-for-all pre-trained generative models, which are not available for graph data. Therefore, we propose the GOLD framework for graph OOD detection, an implicit adversarial learning pipeline with synthetic OOD exposure without pre-trained models. The implicit adversarial training process employs a novel alternating optimisation framework by training: (1) a latent generative model to regularly imitate the in-distribution (ID) embeddings from an evolving GNN, and (2) a GNN encoder and an OOD detector to accurately classify ID data while increasing the energy divergence between the ID embeddings and the generative model's synthetic embeddings. This novel approach implicitly transforms the synthetic embeddings into pseudo-OOD instances relative to the ID data, effectively simulating exposure to OOD scenarios without auxiliary data. Extensive OOD detection experiments are conducted on five benchmark graph datasets, verifying the superior performance of GOLD without using real OOD data compared with the state-of-the-art OOD exposure and non-exposure baselines.</p></details> | ICLR25 |
| **[Prediction of Usage Probabilities of Shopping-Mall Corridors Using Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07645v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method based on graph neural network (GNN) for prediction of probabilities of usage of shopping-mall corridors. The heterogeneous graph network of shops and corridor paths are obtained from floorplans of the malls by creating vector layers for corridors, shops and entrances. These are subsequently assimilated into nodes and edges of graphs. The prediction of the usage probability is based on the shop features, namely, the area and usage categories they fall into, and on the graph connecting these shops, corridor junctions and entrances by corridor paths. Though the presented method is applicable for training on datasets obtained from a field survey or from pedestrian-detecting sensors, the target data of the supervised deep-learning work flow in this work are obtained from a probability method. We also include a context-specific representation learning of latent features. The usage-probability prediction is made on each edge, which is a connection by a section of corridor path between the adjacent nodes representing the shops or corridor points. To create a feature for each edge, the hidden-layer feature vectors acquired in the message-passing GNN layers at the nodes of each edge are averaged and concatenated with the vector obtained by their multiplication. These edge-features are then passed to multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to make the final prediction of usage probability on each edge. The samples of synthetic learning dataset for each shopping mall are obtained by changing the shops' usage and area categories, and by subsequently feeding the graph into the probability model. When including different shopping malls in a single dataset, we also propose to consider graph-level features to inform the model with specific identifying features of each mall.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, working manuscript with partial results</p></details> |

Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets and established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with respect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most comprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the honey bee (Apis mellifera), an ecologically vital pollinator. We evaluate ApisTox using a diverse suite of machine learning approaches, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as well as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical space. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as ApisTox, demonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art algorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for more diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the agrochemical domain.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based methods have made significant progress in the field of Android malware detection. However, traditional detection methods based on static features struggle to identify obfuscated malicious code, while methods relying on dynamic analysis suffer from low efficiency. To address this, we propose a dynamic weighted feature selection method that analyzes the importance and stability of features, calculates scores to filter out the most robust features, and combines these selected features with the program's structural information. We then utilize graph neural networks for classification, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of the detection system. We analyzed 8,664 malware samples from eight malware families and tested a total of 44,940 malware variants generated using seven obfuscation strategies. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves an F1-score of 95.56% on the unobfuscated dataset and 92.28% on the obfuscated dataset, indicating that the model can effectively detect obfuscated malware.</p></details> | 15 pages, 1 figure |

A core desideratum is that explanations are \textit{faithful}, \ie that they portray an accurate picture of the GNN's reasoning process. However, a number of different faithfulness metrics exist, begging the question of what is faithfulness exactly and how to achieve it. We make three key contributions. We begin by showing that \textit{existing metrics are not interchangeable} -- \ie explanations attaining high faithfulness according to one metric may be unfaithful according to others -- and can systematically ignore important properties of explanations. We proceed to show that, surprisingly, \textit{optimizing for faithfulness is not always a sensible design goal}. Specifically, we prove that for injective regular GNN architectures, perfectly faithful explanations are completely uninformative. This does not apply to modular GNNs, such as self-explainable and domain-invariant architectures, prompting us to study the relationship between architectural choices and faithfulness. Finally, we show that \textit{faithfulness is tightly linked to out-of-distribution generalization}, in that simply ensuring that a GNN can correctly recognize the domain-invariant subgraph, as prescribed by the literature, does not guarantee that it is invariant unless this subgraph is also faithful.The code is publicly available on GitHub</p></details> | <details><summary>Uploa...</summary><p>Uploading ICLR25 camera ready version</p></details> |
| **[Towards Scalable and Deep Graph Neural Networks via Noise Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14602v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in many graph mining tasks. However, scaling them to large graphs is challenging due to the high computational and storage costs of repeated feature propagation and non-linear transformation during training. One commonly employed approach to address this challenge is model-simplification, which only executes the Propagation (P) once in the pre-processing, and Combine (C) these receptive fields in different ways and then feed them into a simple model for better performance. Despite their high predictive performance and scalability, these methods still face two limitations. First, existing approaches mainly focus on exploring different C methods from the model perspective, neglecting the crucial problem of performance degradation with increasing P depth from the data-centric perspective, known as the over-smoothing problem. Second, pre-processing overhead takes up most of the end-to-end processing time, especially for large-scale graphs. To address these limitations, we present random walk with noise masking (RMask), a plug-and-play module compatible with the existing model-simplification works. This module enables the exploration of deeper GNNs while preserving their scalability. Unlike the previous model-simplification works, we focus on continuous P and found that the noise existing inside each P is the cause of the over-smoothing issue, and use the efficient masking mechanism to eliminate them. Experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that model-simplification works equipped with RMask yield superior performance compared to their original version and can make a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, incorporating long histories is resource-intensive. Hence, temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) often rely on historical neighbors sampling heuristics such as uniform sampling or recent neighbors selection. These heuristics are static and fail to adapt to the underlying graph structure. We introduce FLASH, a learnable and graph-adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that generalizes existing heuristics. FLASH integrates seamlessly into TGNNs and is trained end-to-end using a self-supervised ranking loss. We provide theoretical evidence that commonly used heuristics hinders TGNNs performance, motivating our design. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent and significant performance improvements for TGNNs equipped with FLASH.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). Where previous works relied on semi-local functionals or fixed-size descriptors of the density, we compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud for efficient non-local atomic-range interactions. By applying an equivariant GNN on this point cloud, we capture molecular-range interactions in a scalable and accurate manner. To train EG-XC, we differentiate through a self-consistent field solver requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Representation Learning, 2025</p></details> |

Surrogate models offer a viable solution to reduce this overhead, but they are untested in real-world aerodynamic datasets. We present a comparative evaluation of two surrogate modeling approaches for predicting drag on a real-world dataset: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that uses a signed distance field as input and a commercial tool based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that directly processes a surface mesh. In contrast to previous studies based on datasets created from parameterized geometries, our dataset comprises 343 geometries derived from 32 baseline vehicle geometries across five distinct car projects, reflecting the diverse, free-form modifications encountered in the typical vehicle development process. Our results show that the CNN-based method achieves a mean absolute error of 2.3 drag counts, while the GNN-based method achieves 3.8. Both methods achieve approximately 77% accuracy in predicting the direction of drag change relative to the baseline geometry. While both methods effectively capture the broader trends between baseline groups (set of samples derived from a single baseline geometry), they struggle to varying extents in capturing the finer intra-baseline group variations. In summary, our findings suggest that aerodynamicists can effectively use both methods to predict drag in under two minutes, which is at least 600 times faster than performing a simulation. However, there remains room for improvement in capturing the finer details of the geometry.</p></details> |  |

The deep learning network for this task relies on historical data inputs, yet real-time data can be corrupted by sensor noise, altering its distribution. We model this noise as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise and incorporate it into the LargeST traffic volume dataset, resulting in data with both inherent and additive noise components. Our approach involves decomposing the corrupted signal into modes using variational mode decomposition, followed by feeding the data into a learning pipeline for prediction. We integrate a 3D attention mechanism encompassing spatial, temporal, and channel attention. The spatial and temporal attention modules learn their respective correlations, while the channel attention mechanism is used to suppress noise and highlight the significant modes in the spatiotemporal signals. Additionally, a learnable soft thresholding method is implemented to exclude unimportant modes from the feature vector, and a feature reduction method based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is applied. We compare the performance of our approach against baseline models, demonstrating that our method achieves superior long-term prediction accuracy, robustness to noise, and improved performance with mode truncation compared to the baseline models.

However, recent studies reveal that GNNs often fail to outperform simple MLPs on heterophilous graph tasks, where connected nodes may differ in features or labels, challenging the homophily assumption. Existing methods addressing this issue often overlook the importance of information granularity and rarely consider implicit relationships between distant nodes. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Granular and Implicit Graph Network (GRAIN), a novel GNN model specifically designed for heterophilous graphs. GRAIN enhances node embeddings by aggregating multi-view information at various granularity levels and incorporating implicit data from distant, non-neighboring nodes. This approach effectively integrates local and global information, resulting in smoother, more accurate node representations. We also introduce an adaptive graph information aggregator that efficiently combines multi-granularity and implicit data, significantly improving node representation quality, as shown by experiments on 13 datasets covering varying homophily and heterophily. GRAIN consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art models, excelling on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing attempts of heterophilous GNNs incorporate long-range or global aggregations to distinguish nodes in the graph. However, these aggregations usually require iteratively maintaining and updating full-graph information, which limits their efficiency when applying to large-scale graphs. In this paper, we propose SIGMA, an efficient global heterophilous GNN aggregation integrating the structural similarity measurement SimRank. Our theoretical analysis illustrates that SIGMA inherently captures distant global similarity even under heterophily, that conventional approaches can only achieve after iterative aggregations. Furthermore, it enjoys efficient one-time computation with a complexity only linear to the node set size $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SIGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior aggregation and overall efficiency. Notably, it obtains $5\times$ acceleration on the large-scale heterophily dataset pokec with over 30 million edges compared to the best baseline aggregation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Acceptted to ICDE 2025</p></details> |

In particular, we are interested in learning distributed optimal controllers using graph recurrent neural networks (GRNNs). Most of the existing approaches result in centralized optimal controllers with offline training processes. However, as the increasing demand of network resilience, the optimal controllers are further expected to be distributed, and are desirable to be trained in an online distributed fashion, which are also the main contributions of our work. To solve this problem, we first propose a GRNN-based distributed optimal control method, and we cast the problem as a self-supervised learning problem. Then, the distributed online training is achieved via distributed gradient computation, and inspired by the (consensus-based) distributed optimization idea, a distributed online training optimizer is designed. Furthermore, the local closed-loop stability of the linear networked system under our proposed GRNN-based controller is provided by assuming that the nonlinear activation function of the GRNN-based controller is both local sector-bounded and slope-restricted. The effectiveness of our proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations using a specifically developed simulator.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

Existing methods like low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are efficient but lack flexibility, while Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enhance model capacity at the cost of more & under-utilized parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Structural Mixture of Residual Experts (S'MoRE), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the efficiency of LoRA with the flexibility of MoE. Specifically, S'MoRE employs hierarchical low-rank decomposition of expert weights, yielding residuals of varying orders interconnected in a multi-layer structure. By routing input tokens through sub-trees of residuals, S'MoRE emulates the capacity of many experts by instantiating and assembling just a few low-rank matrices. We craft the inter-layer propagation of S'MoRE's residuals as a special type of Graph Neural Network (GNN), and prove that under similar parameter budget, S'MoRE improves "structural flexibility" of traditional MoE (or Mixture-of-LoRA) by exponential order. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that S'MoRE achieves superior fine-tuning performance, offering a transformative approach for efficient LLM adaptation.</p></details> |  |

Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |

Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.</p></details> |  |

Typically, reduction approaches either remove edges (sparsification) or merge nodes (coarsening) in an unsupervised way with no specific downstream task in mind. In this paper, we present an approach for subsampling graph structures using an Ising model defined on either the nodes or edges and learning the external magnetic field of the Ising model using a graph neural network. Our approach is task-specific as it can learn how to reduce a graph for a specific downstream task in an end-to-end fashion without requiring a differentiable loss function for the task. We showcase the versatility of our approach on four distinct applications: image segmentation, explainability for graph classification, 3D shape sparsification, and sparse approximate matrix inverse determination.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 22 figures, accepted at the Learning on Graphs conference (LoG 2024)</p></details> |

Traditional metaheuristics excel at exploring complex solution spaces efficiently, yet they often struggle with scalability. Deep learning has become a viable alternative for quickly generating high-quality solutions, particularly when metaheuristics underperform. In recent years, quantum-inspired approaches such as tensor networks have shown promise in addressing these challenges. Despite these advancements, a thorough comparison of the different paradigms is missing. This study evaluates eight algorithms on Weighted Max-Cut graphs ranging from 10 to 250 nodes. Specifically, we compare a Genetic Algorithm representing metaheuristics, a Graph Neural Network for deep learning, and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group as a tensor network approach. Our analysis focuses on solution quality and computational efficiency (i.e., time and memory usage). Numerical results show that the Genetic Algorithm achieves near-optimal results for small graphs, although its computation time grows significantly with problem size. The Graph Neural Network offers a balanced solution for medium-sized instances with low memory demands and rapid inference, yet it exhibits more significant variability on larger graphs. Meanwhile, the Tensor Network approach consistently yields high approximation ratios and efficient execution on larger graphs, albeit with increased memory consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, paper Submitted to GECCO '25</p></details> |
| **[Graph Federated Learning Based Proactive Content Caching in Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04760v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of mobile data traffic and the increasing prevalence of video streaming, proactive content caching in edge computing has become crucial for reducing latency and alleviating network congestion. However, traditional caching strategies such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU fail to effectively predict future content popularity, while existing proactive caching approaches often require users to upload data to a central server, raising concerns regarding privacy and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph Federated Learning-based Proactive Content Caching (GFPCC) scheme that enhances caching efficiency while preserving user privacy. The proposed approach integrates federated learning and graph neural networks, enabling users to locally train Light Graph Convolutional Networks (LightGCN) to capture user-item relationships and predict content popularity. Instead of sharing raw data, only the trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server, where a federated averaging algorithm aggregates updates, refines the global model, and selects the most popular files for proactive caching. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, such as MovieLens, demonstrate that GFPCC outperforms baseline caching algorithms by achieving higher cache efficiency through more accurate content popularity predictions. Moreover, the federated learning framework strengthens privacy protection while maintaining efficient model training; however, scalability remains a challenge in large-scale networks with dynamic user preferences.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in autonomous driving, traditional pipelines rely on deterministic models that fail to capture the probabilistic nature and inherent uncertainty of real-world driving. To address this, we propose PRIMEDrive-CoT, a novel uncertainty-aware model for object interaction and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in driving scenarios. In particular, our approach combines LiDAR-based 3D object detection with multi-view RGB references to ensure interpretable and reliable scene understanding. Uncertainty and risk assessment, along with object interactions, are modelled using Bayesian Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs) for probabilistic reasoning under ambiguous conditions. Interpretable decisions are facilitated through CoT reasoning, leveraging object dynamics and contextual cues, while Grad-CAM visualizations highlight attention regions. Extensive evaluations on the DriveCoT dataset demonstrate that PRIMEDrive-CoT outperforms state-of-the-art CoT and risk-aware models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025 - CVPRW</p></details> |
| **[On the Hölder Stability of Multiset and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06984v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive research efforts have been put into characterizing and constructing maximally separating multiset and graph neural networks. However, recent empirical evidence suggests the notion of separation itself doesn't capture several interesting phenomena. On the one hand, the quality of this separation may be very weak, to the extent that the embeddings of "separable" objects might even be considered identical when using fixed finite precision. On the other hand, architectures which aren't capable of separation in theory, somehow achieve separation when taking the network to be wide enough. In this work, we address both of these issues, by proposing a novel pair-wise separation quality analysis framework which is based on an adaptation of Lipschitz and \Holder{} stability to parametric functions. The proposed framework, which we name \emph{\Holder{} in expectation}, allows for separation quality analysis, without restricting the analysis to embeddings that can separate all the input space simultaneously. We prove that common sum-based models are lower-\Holder{} in expectation, with an exponent that decays rapidly with the network's depth . Our analysis leads to adversarial examples of graphs which can be separated by three 1-WL iterations, but cannot be separated in practice by standard maximally powerful Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). To remedy this, we propose two novel MPNNs with improved separation quality, one of which is lower Lipschitz in expectation. We show these MPNNs can easily classify our adversarial examples, and compare favorably with standard MPNNs on standard graph learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Substructure-Aware Expert Model for Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05844v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular property prediction is essential for applications such as drug discovery and toxicity assessment. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results by modeling molecules as molecular graphs, their reliance on data-driven learning limits their ability to generalize, particularly in the presence of data imbalance and diverse molecular substructures. Existing methods often overlook the varying contributions of different substructures to molecular properties, treating them uniformly. To address these challenges, we propose ASE-Mol, a novel GNN-based framework that leverages a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for molecular property prediction. ASE-Mol incorporates BRICS decomposition and significant substructure awareness to dynamically identify positive and negative substructures. By integrating a MoE architecture, it reduces the adverse impact of negative motifs while improving adaptability to positive motifs. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASE-Mol achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in both accuracy and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural networks excel at learning graph data, the omnipresent non-Euclidean structure, but often lack the generalization capacity. Hence, graph foundation model is drawing increasing attention, and recent efforts have been made to leverage Large Language Models. On the one hand, existing studies primarily focus on text-attributed graphs, while a wider range of real graphs do not contain fruitful textual attributes. On the other hand, the sequential graph description tailored for the Large Language Model neglects the structural complexity, which is a predominant characteristic of the graph. Such limitations motivate an important question: Can we go beyond Large Language Models, and pretrain a universal model to learn the structural knowledge for any graph? The answer in the language or vision domain is a shared vocabulary. We observe the fact that there also exist shared substructures underlying graph domain, and thereby open a new opportunity of graph foundation model with structural vocabulary. The key innovation is the discovery of a simple yet effective structural vocabulary of trees and cycles, and we explore its inherent connection to Riemannian geometry. Herein, we present a universal pretraining model, RiemannGFM. Concretely, we first construct a novel product bundle to incorporate the diverse geometries of the vocabulary. Then, on this constructed space, we stack Riemannian layers where the structural vocabulary, regardless of specific graph, is learned in Riemannian manifold offering cross-domain transferability. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of RiemannGFM on a diversity of real graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |

Our novel framework leverages graph neural networks to post-process ensemble forecasts, specifically modeling the extremes of the underlying distribution.

| **[GraphPINE: Graph Importance Propagation for Interpretable Drug Response Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05454v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainability is necessary for many tasks in biomedical research. Recent explainability methods have focused on attention, gradient, and Shapley value. These do not handle data with strong associated prior knowledge and fail to constrain explainability results based on known relationships between predictive features. We propose GraphPINE, a graph neural network (GNN) architecture leveraging domain-specific prior knowledge to initialize node importance optimized during training for drug response prediction. Typically, a manual post-prediction step examines literature (i.e., prior knowledge) to understand returned predictive features. While node importance can be obtained for gradient and attention after prediction, node importance from these methods lacks complementary prior knowledge; GraphPINE seeks to overcome this limitation. GraphPINE differs from other GNN gating methods by utilizing an LSTM-like sequential format. We introduce an importance propagation layer that unifies 1) updates for feature matrix and node importance and 2) uses GNN-based graph propagation of feature values. This initialization and updating mechanism allows for informed feature learning and improved graph representation. We apply GraphPINE to cancer drug response prediction using drug screening and gene data collected for over 5,000 gene nodes included in a gene-gene graph with a drug-target interaction (DTI) graph for initial importance. The gene-gene graph and DTIs were obtained from curated sources and weighted by article count discussing relationships between drugs and genes. GraphPINE achieves a PR-AUC of 0.894 and ROC-AUC of 0.796 across 952 drugs. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GraphPINE-40DE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe Automated Refactoring for Efficient Migration of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support responsiveness w.r.t. ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations to make code amenable to safe, accurate, and efficient graph execution. We present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in specifying whether their otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL code could be reliably and efficiently executed as graphs while preserving semantics. The approach, based on a novel imperative tensor analysis, automatically determines when it is safe and potentially advantageous to migrate imperative DL code to graph execution. The approach is implemented as a PyDev Eclipse IDE plug-in that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and evaluated on 19 Python projects consisting of 132.05 KLOC. We found that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Approach to Linking Histology Images with DNA Methylation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05403v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression by adding methyl groups to DNA. Abnormal methylation patterns can disrupt gene expression and have been linked to cancer development. To quantify DNA methylation, specialized assays are typically used. However, these assays are often costly and have lengthy processing times, which limits their widespread availability in routine clinical practice. In contrast, whole slide images (WSIs) for the majority of cancer patients can be more readily available. As such, given the ready availability of WSIs, there is a compelling need to explore the potential relationship between WSIs and DNA methylation patterns. To address this, we propose an end-to-end graph neural network based weakly supervised learning framework to predict the methylation state of gene groups exhibiting coherent patterns across samples. Using data from three cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - TCGA-LGG (Brain Lower Grade Glioma), TCGA-GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) ($n$=729) and TCGA-KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma) ($n$=511) - we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher AUROC scores than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, by more than $20\%$. We conduct gene set enrichment analyses on the gene groups and show that majority of the gene groups are significantly enriched in important hallmarks and pathways. We also generate spatially enriched heatmaps to further investigate links between histological patterns and DNA methylation states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores association of spatially resolved histological patterns with gene group methylation states across multiple cancer types using weakly supervised deep learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Coarse-Grained Dynamics on Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09324v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a Graph Neural Network (GNN) non-Markovian modeling framework to identify coarse-grained dynamical systems on graphs. Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.</p></details> | 43 pages, 12 figures |

Traditional compartmental models often struggle to estimate temporally and spatially varying epidemiological parameters, while deep learning models typically overlook disease transmission dynamics and lack interpretability in the epidemiological context. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Causal Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (CSTGNN), a hybrid framework that integrates a Spatio-Contact SIR model with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of epidemics. Inter-regional human mobility exhibits continuous and smooth spatiotemporal patterns, leading to adjacent graph structures that share underlying mobility dynamics. To model these dynamics, we employ an adaptive static connectivity graph to represent the stable components of human mobility and utilize a temporal dynamics model to capture fluctuations within these patterns. By integrating the adaptive static connectivity graph with the temporal dynamics graph, we construct a dynamic graph that encapsulates the comprehensive properties of human mobility networks. Additionally, to capture temporal trends and variations in infectious disease spread, we introduce a temporal decomposition model to handle temporal dependence. This model is then integrated with a dynamic graph convolutional network for epidemic forecasting. We validate our model using real-world datasets at the provincial level in China and the state level in Germany. Extensive studies demonstrate that our method effectively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases, providing a valuable tool for forecasting and intervention strategies. Furthermore, analysis of the learned parameters offers insights into disease transmission mechanisms, enhancing the interpretability and practical applicability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 12 figures.

Current computational methods for modeling these relationships face three major challenges: (1) the failure to model asymmetric relationships, e.g., one individual may perceive the other as a friend while the other perceives them as an acquaintance, (2) the disruption of continuous interactions by discrete frame sampling, which segments the temporal continuity of interaction in real-world scenarios, and (3) the limitation to consider periodic behavioral cues, such as rhythmic vocalizations or recurrent gestures, which are crucial for inferring the evolution of dyadic relationships. To address these challenges, we propose AsyReC, a multimodal graph-based framework for asymmetric dyadic relationship classification, with three core innovations: (i) a triplet graph neural network with node-edge dual attention that dynamically weights multimodal cues to capture interaction asymmetries (addressing challenge 1); (ii) a clip-level relationship learning architecture that preserves temporal continuity, enabling fine-grained modeling of real-world interaction dynamics (addressing challenge 2); and (iii) a periodic temporal encoder that projects time indices onto sine/cosine waveforms to model recurrent behavioral patterns (addressing challenge 3). Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, while ablation studies validate the critical role of asymmetric interaction modeling and periodic temporal encoding in improving the robustness of dyadic relationship classification in real-world scenarios.

For example, in domestic environments, robots can proactively help users by fetching needed objects based on learned routines, which they infer by observing how objects move over time. However, data from these interactions are inherently non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.), e.g., a robot assisting multiple users may encounter varying data distributions as individuals follow distinct habits. This creates a challenge: integrating new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose STREAK (Spatio Temporal RElocation with Adaptive Knowledge retention), a continual learning framework for real-world robotic learning. It leverages a streaming graph neural network with regularization and rehearsal techniques to mitigate context drifts while retaining past knowledge. Our method is time- and memory-efficient, enabling long-term learning without retraining on all past data, which becomes infeasible as data grows in real-world interactions. We evaluate STREAK on the task of incrementally predicting human routines over 50+ days across different households. Results show that it effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting while maintaining generalization, making it a scalable solution for long-term human-robot interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextualized Messages Boost Graph Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12529v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to process data that may be represented as graphs. This has prompted several studies to explore their representational capability based on the graph isomorphism task. Notably, these works inherently assume a countable node feature representation, potentially limiting their applicability. Interestingly, only a few study GNNs with uncountable node feature representation. In the paper, a new perspective on the representational capability of GNNs is investigated across all levels$\unicode{x2014}$node-level, neighborhood-level, and graph-level$\unicode{x2014}$when the space of node feature representation is uncountable. Specifically, the injective and metric requirements of previous works are softly relaxed by employing a pseudometric distance on the space of input to create a soft-injective function such that distinct inputs may produce similar outputs if and only if the pseudometric deems the inputs to be sufficiently similar on some representation. As a consequence, a simple and computationally efficient soft-isomorphic relational graph convolution network (SIR-GCN) that emphasizes the contextualized transformation of neighborhood feature representations via anisotropic and dynamic message functions is proposed. Furthermore, a mathematical discussion on the relationship between SIR-GCN and key GNNs in literature is laid out to put the contribution into context, establishing SIR-GCN as a generalization of classical GNN methodologies. To close, experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the relative superiority of SIR-GCN, outperforming comparable models in node and graph property prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |

Making predictions on relational data often involves transforming them into a flat tabular format through table joins and feature engineering, which serve as input to tabular methods. However, designing features that fully capture complex relational patterns remains challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a compelling alternative by inherently modeling these relationships, but their time overhead during inference limits their applicability for real-time scenarios. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging existing feature engineering efforts to enhance the efficiency of GNNs in relational databases. Specifically, we use GNNs to capture complex relationships within relational databases, patterns that are difficult to featurize, while employing engineered features to encode temporal information, thereby avoiding the need to retain the entire historical graph and enabling the use of smaller, more efficient graphs. Our \textsc{LightRDL} approach not only improves efficiency, but also outperforms existing models. Experimental results on the RelBench benchmark demonstrate that our framework achieves up to $33\%$ performance improvement and a $526\times$ inference speedup compared to GNNs, making it highly suitable for real-time inference.</p></details> |  |

This is a non-Transformer, non-GPT, non-traditional machine learning input-output controlled generative language model. The model is based on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) definition on the directed graph in terms of the neural network, and has the interpretability of all nodes on the graph of the whole model, instead of the traditional machine learning model that only has limited interpretability at the input and output ends. In the language model scenario, the token is defined as a node in the graph. A randomly shaped or user-defined signal flow flows between nodes on the principle of "least resistance" along paths. The next token or node to be predicted or generated is the target of the signal flow. As a language model, BriLLM theoretically supports infinitely long $n$-gram models when the model size is independent of the input and predicted length of the model. The model's working signal flow provides the possibility of recall activation and innate multi-modal support similar to the cognitive patterns of the human brain. At present, we released the first BriLLM version in Chinese, with 4000 tokens, 32-dimensional node width, 16-token long sequence prediction ability, and language model prediction performance comparable to GPT-1. More computing power will help us explore the infinite possibilities depicted above.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attentional Graph Meta-Learning for Indoor Localization Using Extremely Sparse Fingerprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04829v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fingerprint-based indoor localization is often labor-intensive due to the need for dense grids and repeated measurements across time and space. Maintaining high localization accuracy with extremely sparse fingerprints remains a persistent challenge. Existing benchmark methods primarily rely on the measured fingerprints, while neglecting valuable spatial and environmental characteristics. In this paper, we propose a systematic integration of an Attentional Graph Neural Network (AGNN) model, capable of learning spatial adjacency relationships and aggregating information from neighboring fingerprints, and a meta-learning framework that utilizes datasets with similar environmental characteristics to enhance model training. To minimize the labor required for fingerprint collection, we introduce two novel data augmentation strategies: 1) unlabeled fingerprint augmentation using moving platforms, which enables the semi-supervised AGNN model to incorporate information from unlabeled fingerprints, and 2) synthetic labeled fingerprint augmentation through environmental digital twins, which enhances the meta-learning framework through a practical distribution alignment, which can minimize the feature discrepancy between synthetic and real-world fingerprints effectively. By integrating these novel modules, we propose the Attentional Graph Meta-Learning (AGML) model. This novel model combines the strengths of the AGNN model and the meta-learning framework to address the challenges posed by extremely sparse fingerprints. To validate our approach, we collected multiple datasets from both consumer-grade WiFi devices and professional equipment across diverse environments. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the AGML model-based localization method consistently outperforms all baseline methods using sparse fingerprints across all evaluated metrics.</p></details> |  |

We first review our previous network localization method based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which can exhibit state-of-the-art localization accuracy, even under severe Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions, by carefully preselecting a constant threshold for determining adjacency. As an extension, we propose a specially designed Attentional GNN (AGNN) model to resolve the sensitive thresholding issue of the GCN-based method and enhance the underlying model capacity. The AGNN comprises an Adjacency Learning Module (ALM) and Multiple Graph Attention Layers (MGAL), employing distinct attention architectures to systematically address the demerits of the GCN-based method, rendering it more practical for real-world applications. Comprehensive analyses are conducted to explain the superior performance of these methods, including a theoretical analysis of the AGNN's dynamic attention property and computational complexity, along with a systematic discussion of their robust characteristic against NLOS measurements. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GCN-based and AGNN-based network localization methods. Notably, integrating attention mechanisms into the AGNN yields substantial improvements in localization accuracy, approaching the fundamental lower bound and showing approximately 37\% to 53\% reduction in localization error compared to the vanilla GCN-based method across various NLOS noise configurations. Both methods outperform all competing approaches by far in terms of localization accuracy, robustness, and computational time, especially for considerably large network sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Hierarchical Protein Multi-Modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04770v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks. Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural information. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Through extensive experiments on a diverse set of protein-related tasks, our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including react (enzyme/EC classification), model quality assessment (MQA), protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (LBA), protein-protein binding site prediction (PPBS), and B cell epitopes prediction (BCEs). Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of BIHIERARCHICAL FUSION in bridging sequence and structural modalities.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional statistical methods struggle with nonlinear effects, while machine learning models often fail to capture geographical (nearby areas being more similar) and topological (unequal connectivity between places) effects in an interpretable way. To address this, we propose MedGNN, a spatio-topologically explicit framework that constructs a 2-hop spatial graph, integrating positional and locational node embeddings with urban characteristics in a graph neural network. Applied to MEDSAT, a comprehensive dataset covering over 150 environmental and socio-demographic factors and six prescription outcomes (depression, anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and opioids) across 4,835 Greater London neighborhoods, MedGNN improved predictions by over 25% on average compared to baseline methods. Using depression prescriptions as a case study, we analyzed graph embeddings via geographical principal component analysis, identifying findings that: align with prior research (e.g., higher antidepressant prescriptions among older and White populations), contribute to ongoing debates (e.g., greenery linked to higher and NO2 to lower prescriptions), and warrant further study (e.g., canopy evaporation correlated with fewer prescriptions). These results demonstrate MedGNN's potential, and more broadly, of carefully applied machine learning, to advance transdisciplinary public health research.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages' main content.

| **[Sparsity-Aware Communication for Distributed Graph Neural Network Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04673v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a computationally efficient method to learn embeddings and classifications on graph data. However, GNN training has low computational intensity, making communication costs the bottleneck for scalability. Sparse-matrix dense-matrix multiplication (SpMM) is the core computational operation in full-graph training of GNNs. Previous work parallelizing this operation focused on sparsity-oblivious algorithms, where matrix elements are communicated regardless of the sparsity pattern. This leads to a predictable communication pattern that can be overlapped with computation and enables the use of collective communication operations at the expense of wasting significant bandwidth by communicating unnecessary data. We develop sparsity-aware algorithms that tackle the communication bottlenecks in GNN training with three novel approaches. First, we communicate only the necessary matrix elements. Second, we utilize a graph partitioning model to reorder the matrix and drastically reduce the amount of communicated elements. Finally, we address the high load imbalance in communication with a tailored partitioning model, which minimizes both the total communication volume and the maximum sending volume. We further couple these sparsity-exploiting approaches with a communication-avoiding approach (1.5D parallel SpMM) in which submatrices are replicated to reduce communication. We explore the tradeoffs of these combined optimizations and show up to 14X improvement on 256 GPUs and on some instances reducing communication to almost zero resulting in a communication-free parallel training relative to a popular GNN framework based on communication-oblivious SpMM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Graph Neural Networks for Particle Track Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04670v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle track reconstruction is an important problem in high-energy physics (HEP), necessary to study properties of subatomic particles. Traditional track reconstruction algorithms scale poorly with the number of particles within the accelerator. The Exa.TrkX project, to alleviate this computational burden, introduces a pipeline that reduces particle track reconstruction to edge classification on a graph, and uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to produce particle tracks. However, this GNN-based approach is memory-prohibitive and skips graphs that would exceed GPU memory. We introduce improvements to the Exa.TrkX pipeline to train on samples of input particle graphs, and show that these improvements generalize to higher precision and recall. In addition, we adapt performance optimizations, introduced for GNN training, to fit our augmented Exa.TrkX pipeline. These optimizations provide a $2\times$ speedup over our baseline implementation in PyTorch Geometric.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Network (GNN) execution involves both compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels, the latter dominates the total time, being significantly bottlenecked by data movement between memory and processors. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) systems can alleviate this data movement bottleneck by placing simple processors near or inside to memory arrays. In this work, we introduce PyGim, an efficient ML library that accelerates GNNs on real PIM systems. We propose intelligent parallelization techniques for memory-intensive kernels of GNNs tailored for real PIM systems, and develop handy Python API for them. We provide hybrid GNN execution, in which the compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels are executed in processor-centric and memory-centric computing systems, respectively. We extensively evaluate PyGim on a real-world PIM system with 1992 PIM cores using emerging GNN models, and demonstrate that it outperforms its state-of-the-art CPU counterpart on Intel Xeon by on average 3.04x, and achieves higher resource utilization than CPU and GPU systems. Our work provides useful recommendations for software, system and hardware designers. PyGim is publicly available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/PyGim.</p></details> |  |
| **[Link Prediction with Physics-Inspired Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14802v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The message-passing mechanism underlying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is not naturally suited for heterophilic datasets, where adjacent nodes often have different labels. Most solutions to this problem remain confined to the task of node classification. In this article, we focus on the valuable task of link prediction under heterophily, an interesting problem for recommendation systems, social network analysis, and other applications. GNNs like GRAFF have improved node classification under heterophily by incorporating physics biases in the architecture. Similarly, we propose GRAFF-LP, an extension of GRAFF for link prediction. We show that GRAFF-LP effectively discriminates existing from non-existing edges by learning implicitly to separate the edge gradients. Based on this information, we propose a new readout function inspired by physics. Remarkably, this new function not only enhances the performance of GRAFF-LP but also improves that of other baseline models, leading us to reconsider how every link prediction experiment has been conducted so far. Finally, we provide evidence that even simple GNNs did not experience greater difficulty in predicting heterophilic links compared to homophilic ones. This leads us to believe in the necessity for heterophily measures specifically tailored for link prediction, distinct from those used in node classification.

Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE journal for possible publication.

However, they struggle with long-range dependencies in fluid flows, particularly in refined mesh regions. This challenge, known as the 'over-squashing' problem, hinders information propagation. While existing graph rewiring methods address this issue to some extent, they only consider graph topology, overlooking the underlying physical phenomena. We propose Physics-Informed Ollivier-Ricci Flow (PIORF), a novel rewiring method that combines physical correlations with graph topology. PIORF uses Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC) to identify bottleneck regions and connects these areas with nodes in high-velocity gradient nodes, enabling long-range interactions and mitigating over-squashing. Our approach is computationally efficient in rewiring edges and can scale to larger simulations. Experimental results on 3 fluid dynamics benchmark datasets show that PIORF consistently outperforms baseline models and existing rewiring methods, achieving up to 26.2 improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Traditional CNNs excel at extracting rich spatial features from images but lack the inherent capability to model inter-object relationships. Conversely, conventional GNNs typically rely on flattened node features, thereby discarding vital spatial details. TGraphX overcomes these limitations by employing CNNs to generate multi-dimensional node features (e.g., (3*128*128) tensors) that preserve local spatial semantics. These spatially aware nodes participate in a graph where message passing is performed using 1*1 convolutions, which fuse adjacent features while maintaining their structure. Furthermore, a deep CNN aggregator with residual connections is used to robustly refine the fused messages, ensuring stable gradient flow and end-to-end trainability. Our approach not only bridges the gap between spatial feature extraction and relational reasoning but also demonstrates significant improvements in object detection refinement and ensemble reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to arXiv.

Current strategies for processing point clouds typically downsample the scene or divide it into smaller parts for separate analysis. However, both approaches risk losing key local details or global contextual information. In this paper, we introduce PerLA, a 3D language assistant designed to be more perceptive to both details and context, making visual representations more informative for the LLM. PerLA captures high-resolution (local) details in parallel from different point cloud areas and integrates them with (global) context obtained from a lower-resolution whole point cloud. We present a novel algorithm that preserves point cloud locality through the Hilbert curve and effectively aggregates local-to-global information via cross-attention and a graph neural network. Lastly, we introduce a novel loss for local representation consensus to promote training stability. PerLA outperforms state-of-the-art 3D language assistants, with gains of up to +1.34 CiDEr on ScanQA for question answering, and +4.22 on ScanRefer and +3.88 on Nr3D for dense captioning. https://gfmei.github.io/PerLA/</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

For this reason, reducing the number of two-qubit gates is of paramount importance on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. To advance towards more reliable quantum computing, we introduce a framework based on ZX calculus, graph-neural networks and reinforcement learning for quantum circuit optimization. By combining reinforcement learning and tree search, our method addresses the challenge of selecting optimal sequences of ZX calculus rewrite rules. Instead of relying on existing heuristic rules for minimizing circuits, our method trains a novel reinforcement learning policy that directly operates on ZX-graphs, therefore allowing us to search through the space of all possible circuit transformations to find a circuit significantly minimizing the number of CNOT gates. This way we can scale beyond hard-coded rules towards discovering arbitrary optimization rules. We demonstrate our method's competetiveness with state-of-the-art circuit optimizers and generalization capabilities on large sets of diverse random circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proximal Policy Optimization with Graph Neural Networks for Optimal Power Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12470v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a very traditional research area within the power systems field that seeks for the optimal operation point of electric power plants, and which needs to be solved every few minutes in real-world scenarios. However, due to the nonconvexities that arise in power generation systems, there is not yet a fast, robust solution technique for the full Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). In the last decades, power grids have evolved into a typical dynamic, non-linear and large-scale control system, known as the power system, so searching for better and faster ACOPF solutions is becoming crucial. Appearance of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has allowed the natural use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on graph data, such as power networks. On the other hand, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is known for its powerful capability to solve complex decision-making problems. Although solutions that use these two methods separately are beginning to appear in the literature, none has yet combined the advantages of both. We propose a novel architecture based on the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm with Graph Neural Networks to solve the Optimal Power Flow. The objective is to design an architecture that learns how to solve the optimization problem and that is at the same time able to generalize to unseen scenarios. We compare our solution with the DCOPF in terms of cost after having trained our DRL agent on IEEE 30 bus system and then computing the OPF on that base network with topology changes</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, due to the vulnerabilities of GNNs, it has been empirically proved that malicious attackers could easily corrupt the fairness level of their predictions by adding perturbations to the input graph data. In this paper, we take crucial steps to study a novel problem of certifiable defense on the fairness level of GNNs. Specifically, we propose a principled framework named ELEGANT and present a detailed theoretical certification analysis for the fairness of GNNs. ELEGANT takes any GNNs as its backbone, and the fairness level of such a backbone is theoretically impossible to be corrupted under certain perturbation budgets for attackers. Notably, ELEGANT does not have any assumption over the GNN structure or parameters, and does not require re-training the GNNs to realize certification. Hence it can serve as a plug-and-play framework for any optimized GNNs ready to be deployed. We verify the satisfactory effectiveness of ELEGANT in practice through extensive experiments on real-world datasets across different backbones of GNNs, where ELEGANT is also demonstrated to be beneficial for GNN debiasing.

This work benchmarks various GNN architectures to identify the most effective methods for heterogeneous graphs, with a particular focus on node classification and link prediction. Our findings reveal that graph attention networks excel in these tasks. As a main contribution, we explore enhancements to these attention networks by integrating positional encodings for node embeddings. This involves utilizing the full Laplacian spectrum to accurately capture both the relative and absolute positions of each node within the graph, further enhancing performance on downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Transformers have achieved superior performance in node classification tasks. However, the key concern with Graph Convolutional Networks is over-squashing, which limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies in the network. Additionally, Graph Transformers face scalability challenges, making it difficult to process large graphs efficiently. To address this, we propose a novel framework, A Hybrid SImilarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification (SIGNNet), which capitalizes on local and global structural information, enhances the model's capability to effectively capture fine-grained relationships and broader contextual patterns within the graph structure. The proposed method leverages Graph Convolutional Networks alongside a score-based mechanism to effectively capture local and global node interactions while addressing the limitations of over-squashing. Our proposed method employs a novel Personalized PageRank-based node sampling method to address scalability issues by generating subgraphs of nodes. Additionally, SIGNNet incorporates a novel attention mechanism, Structure-Aware Multi-Head Attention (SA-MHA), which integrates node structural information for informed attention weighting, enabling the model to prioritize nodes based on topological significance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods, with average accuracy gains of 6.03%, 5.47%, 4.78%, 19.10%, 19.61%, 7.22%, 19.54%, and 14.94% on Cora, Citeseer, CS, Wisconsin, Texas, Actor, Cornell and Chameleon datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

By utilizing rich graph descriptions, this paradigm leverages LLMs to generate high-quality embeddings, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the field faces significant challenges: (1) the absence of a unified framework to systematize the diverse optimization perspectives arising from the complex interactions between LLMs and GNNs, and (2) the lack of a robust method capable of handling real-world TAGs, which often suffer from texts and edge sparsity, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose UltraTAG, a unified pipeline for LLM-enhanced TAG learning. UltraTAG provides a unified comprehensive and domain-adaptive framework that not only organizes existing methodologies but also paves the way for future advancements in the field. Building on this framework, we propose UltraTAG-S, a robust instantiation of UltraTAG designed to tackle the inherent sparsity issues in real-world TAGs. UltraTAG-S employs LLM-based text propagation and text augmentation to mitigate text sparsity, while leveraging LLM-augmented node selection techniques based on PageRank and edge reconfiguration strategies to address edge sparsity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraTAG-S significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving improvements of 2.12\% and 17.47\% in ideal and sparse settings, respectively. Moreover, as the data sparsity ratio increases, the performance improvement of UltraTAG-S also rises, which underscores the effectiveness and robustness of UltraTAG-S.</p></details> |  |

The most effective way to prevent fraud is by contacting customers to verify suspicious transactions. However, while these systems are designed to detect fraudulent activity, they often mistakenly flag legitimate transactions, leading to unnecessary declines that disrupt the user experience and erode customer trust. Frequent false positives can frustrate customers, resulting in dissatisfaction, increased complaints, and a diminished sense of security. To address these limitations, we propose a fraud detection framework incorporating Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying fraudulent transactions. By leveraging the relational structure of transaction data, our model reduces the need for direct customer confirmation while maintaining high detection performance. Our experiments are conducted using the IBM credit card transaction dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.</p></details> |  |

While user-written comments provide explicit insights about preferences, merging these textual representations from large language models (LLMs) with graph-based embeddings of user actions remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose a framework that employs both a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based model and an LLM to produce review-aware representations, preserving review semantics while mitigating textual noise. Our approach utilizes a hybrid objective that balances user-item interactions against text-derived features, ensuring that user's both behavioral and linguistic signals are effectively captured. We evaluate this method on multiple datasets from diverse application domains, demonstrating consistent improvements over a baseline GNN-based recommender model. Notably, our model achieves significant gains in recommendation accuracy when review data is sparse or unevenly distributed. These findings highlight the importance of integrating LLM-driven textual feedback with GNN-derived user behavioral patterns to develop robust, context-aware recommender systems.</p></details> | Under Review |

Hierarchical variants offer a distinct advantage by analysing the time series across multiple resolutions, making them particularly effective in tasks like global weather forecasting, where low-resolution variable interactions are significant. A critical challenge in hierarchical models is information loss during forward or backward passes through the hierarchy. We propose the Hierarchical Graph Flow (HiGFlow) network, which introduces a memory buffer variable of dynamic size to store previously seen information across variable resolutions. We theoretically show two key results: HiGFlow reduces smoothness when mapping onto new feature spaces in the hierarchy and non-strictly enhances the utility of message-passing by improving Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) expressivity.

| **[OmniCellTOSG: The First Cell Text-Omic Signaling Graphs Dataset for Joint LLM and GNN Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02148v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex cell signaling systems -- governed by varying protein abundances and interactions -- generate diverse cell types across organs. These systems evolve under influences such as age, sex, diet, environmental exposures, and diseases, making them challenging to decode given the involvement of tens of thousands of genes and proteins. Recently, hundreds of millions of single-cell omics data have provided a robust foundation for understanding these signaling networks within various cell subpopulations and conditions. Inspired by the success of large foundation models (for example, large language models and large vision models) pre-trained on massive datasets, we introduce OmniCellTOSG, the first dataset of cell text-omic signaling graphs (TOSGs). Each TOSG represents the signaling network of an individual or meta-cell and is labeled with information such as organ, disease, sex, age, and cell subtype. OmniCellTOSG offers two key contributions. First, it introduces a novel graph model that integrates human-readable annotations -- such as biological functions, cellular locations, signaling pathways, related diseases, and drugs -- with quantitative gene and protein abundance data, enabling graph reasoning to decode cell signaling. This approach calls for new joint models combining large language models and graph neural networks. Second, the dataset is built from single-cell RNA sequencing data of approximately 120 million cells from diverse tissues and conditions (healthy and diseased) and is fully compatible with PyTorch. This facilitates the development of innovative cell signaling models that could transform research in life sciences, healthcare, and precision medicine. The OmniCellTOSG dataset is continuously expanding and will be updated regularly. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/FuhaiLiAiLab/OmniCellTOSG.</p></details> |  |

Current methods often struggle with sparse or noisy data and rely on static graphs, limiting their ability to capture dynamic changes between nodes and relationships. This paper introduces LL4G, a self-supervised framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to optimize graph neural networks (GNNs). LLMs extract rich semantic features to generate node representations and to infer explicit and implicit relationships. The graph structure adaptively adds nodes and edges based on input data, continuously optimizing itself. The GNN then uses these optimized representations for joint training on node reconstruction, edge prediction, and contrastive learning tasks. This integration of semantic and structural information generates robust personality profiles. Experimental results on Kaggle and Pandora datasets show LL4G outperforms state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Text to Graph: Leveraging Graph Neural Networks for Enhanced Explainability in NLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02064v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have relegated natural language processing tasks to Transformer-type models, particularly generative models, because these models exhibit high versatility when performing generation and classification tasks. As the size of these models increases, they achieve outstanding results. Given their widespread use, many explainability techniques are developed based on these models. However, this process becomes computationally expensive due to the large size of the models. Additionally, transformers interpret input information through tokens that fragment input words into sequences lacking inherent semantic meaning, complicating the explanation of the model from the very beginning. This study proposes a novel methodology to achieve explainability in natural language processing tasks by automatically converting sentences into graphs and maintaining semantics through nodes and relations that express fundamental linguistic concepts. It also allows the subsequent exploitation of this knowledge in subsequent tasks, making it possible to obtain trends and understand how the model associates the different elements inside the text with the explained task. The experiments delivered promising results in determining the most critical components within the text structure for a given classification.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Abusive Language Detection (ALD) models often overlook this context, which can lead to unreliable performance metrics. Recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods that integrate conversational context often depend on limited and simplified representations, and report inconsistent results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) to model social media conversations as graphs, where nodes represent comments, and edges capture reply structures. We systematically investigate various graph representations and context windows to identify the optimal configuration for ALD. Our GNN model outperform both context-agnostic baselines and linear context-aware methods, achieving significant improvements in F1 scores. These findings demonstrate the critical role of structured conversational context and establish GNNs as a robust framework for advancing context-aware abusive language detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Reasoning in the Embedding Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02018v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this contribution, we demonstrate that Graph Neural Networks and Transformers can learn to reason about geometric constraints. We train them to predict spatial position of points in a discrete 2D grid from a set of constraints that uniquely describe hidden figures containing these points. Both models are able to predict the position of points and interestingly, they form the hidden figures described by the input constraints in the embedding space during the reasoning process. Our analysis shows that both models recover the grid structure during training so that the embeddings corresponding to the points within the grid organize themselves in a 2D subspace and reflect the neighborhood structure of the grid. We also show that the Graph Neural Network we design for the task performs significantly better than the Transformer and is also easier to scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00490v4)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by WWW2025</p></details> |

Obfuscation is one of the most used techniques to ensure such protection. Consequently, attackers must first detect and characterize obfuscation before launching any attack against it. This paper investigates the problem of function-level obfuscation detection using graph-based approaches, comparing algorithms, from elementary baselines to promising techniques like GNN (Graph Neural Networks), on different feature choices. We consider various obfuscation types and obfuscators, resulting in two complex datasets. Our findings demonstrate that GNNs need meaningful features that capture aspects of function semantics to outperform baselines. Our approach shows satisfactory results, especially in a challenging 11-class classification task and in a practical malware analysis example.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 13th International Conference on Complex Networks and their Applications, Dec 2024, Istabul, Turkey</p></details> |

In recent years, various studies in the vision domain have made notable advancements in this area. However, the varying topological structures and non-grid nature of graph data render the methods from the vision domain ineffective. Building upon prior research into differentiable methods for graph neural networks, we propose a fast and high-quality data-free knowledge distillation approach in this paper. Without compromising distillation quality, the proposed graph-free KD method (ACGKD) significantly reduces the spatial complexity of pseudo-graphs by leveraging the Binary Concrete distribution to model the graph structure and introducing a spatial complexity tuning parameter. This approach enables efficient gradient computation for the graph structure, thereby accelerating the overall distillation process. Additionally, ACGKD eliminates the dimensional ambiguity between the student and teacher models by increasing the student's dimensions and reusing the teacher's classifier. Moreover, it equips graph knowledge distillation with a CL-based strategy to ensure the student learns graph structures progressively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACGKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in distilling knowledge from GNNs without training data.</p></details> |  |

The conventional approaches extended from optimization perspectives are usually quite involved, especially when jointly considering factors in different scales such as deployment and transmission in UAV-related scenarios. In this paper, we address the UAV-enabled multi-user secure communications by proposing a deep graph reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we reinterpret the security beamforming as a graph neural network (GNN) learning task, where mutual interference among users is managed through the message-passing mechanism. Then, the UAV deployment is obtained through soft actor-critic reinforcement learning, where the GNN-based security beamforming is exploited to guide the deployment strategy update. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal security performance and significantly enhances the efficiency of strategy determination. Moreover, the deep graph reinforcement learning framework offers a scalable solution, adaptable to various network scenarios and configurations, establishing a robust basis for information security in UAV-enabled communications.</p></details> | Accepted at IEEE TMC |

Most existing methods feed textual descriptions of the graph structure or neighbouring nodes' text directly into LLMs. However, these approaches often cause LLMs to treat structural information simply as general contextual text, thus limiting their effectiveness in graph-related tasks. In this paper, we introduce LanSAGNN (Language Semantic Anisotropic Graph Neural Network), a framework that extends the concept of anisotropic GNNs to the natural language level. This model leverages LLMs to extract tailor-made semantic information for node pairs, effectively capturing the unique interactions within node relationships. In addition, we propose an efficient dual-layer LLMs finetuning architecture to better align LLMs' outputs with graph tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LanSAGNN significantly enhances existing LLM-based methods without increasing complexity while also exhibiting strong robustness against interference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |

Existing deep learning methods tend to ignore the information of internal sub-structural features of drug molecules and drug-target interactions, resulting in limited prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a drug-target association prediction model HCAF-DTA based on cross-attention fusion hypergraph neural network. The model innovatively introduces hypergraph representation in the feature extraction stage: drug molecule hypergraphs are constructed based on the tree decomposition algorithm, and the sub-structural and global features extracted by fusing the hypergraph neural network with the graphical neural network through hopping connections, in which the hyper edges can efficiently characterise the functional functional groups and other key chemical features; for the protein feature extraction, a weighted graph is constructed based on the residues predicted by the ESM model contact maps to construct weighted graphs, and multilayer graph neural networks were used to capture spatial dependencies. In the prediction stage, a bidirectional multi-head cross-attention mechanism is designed to model intermolecular interactions from the dual viewpoints of atoms and amino acids, and cross-modal features with correlated information are fused by attention. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Davis and KIBA show that HCAF-DTA outperforms state of the arts in all three performance evaluation metrics, with the MSE metrics reaching 0.198 and 0.122, respectively, with an improvement of up to 4% from the optimal baseline.</p></details> |  |

It leads to a decline in memory, reasoning ability, and behavior, especially in older people. The cause of Alzheimer's Disease is still under exploration and there is no all-inclusive theory that can explain the pathologies in each individual patient. Nevertheless, early intervention has been found to be effective in managing symptoms and slowing down the disease's progression. Recent research has utilized electroencephalography (EEG) data to identify biomarkers that distinguish Alzheimer's Disease patients from healthy individuals. Prior studies have used various machine learning methods, including deep learning and graph neural networks, to examine electroencephalography-based signals for identifying Alzheimer's Disease patients. In our research, we proposed a Flexible and Explainable Gated Graph Convolutional Network (GGCN) with Multi-Objective Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (MOTPE) hyperparameter tuning. This provides a flexible solution that efficiently identifies the optimal number of GGCN blocks to achieve the optimized precision, specificity, and recall outcomes, as well as the optimized area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC). Our findings demonstrated a high efficacy with an over 0.9 Receiver Operating Characteristic score, alongside precision, specificity, and recall scores in distinguishing health control with Alzheimer's Disease patients in Moderate to Severe Dementia using the power spectrum density (PSD) of electroencephalography signals across various frequency bands. Moreover, our research enhanced the interpretability of the embedded adjacency matrices, revealing connectivity differences in frontal and parietal brain regions between Alzheimer's patients and healthy individuals.</p></details> |  |

Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently emerged as leading models in geometric deep learning, outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in various graph learning tasks. However, the development of tokenizers for graphs has lagged behind other modalities. To address this, we introduce GQT (\textbf{G}raph \textbf{Q}uantized \textbf{T}okenizer), which decouples tokenizer training from Transformer training by leveraging multi-task graph self-supervised learning, yielding robust and generalizable graph tokens. Furthermore, the GQT utilizes Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to learn hierarchical discrete tokens, resulting in significantly reduced memory requirements and improved generalization capabilities. By combining the GQT with token modulation, a Transformer encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on 20 out of 22 benchmarks, including large-scale homophilic and heterophilic datasets.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, GNNs may produce biased predictions against certain demographic subgroups due to node attributes and neighbors surrounding a node. Most current research on GNN fairness focuses predominantly on debiasing GNNs using oversimplified fairness evaluation metrics, which can give a misleading impression of fairness. Understanding the potential evaluation paradoxes due to the complicated nature of the graph structure is crucial for developing effective GNN debiasing mechanisms. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of current GNN debiasing methods in terms of unfairness evaluation. Specifically, we introduce a community-level strategy to measure bias in GNNs and evaluate debiasing methods at this level. Further, We introduce ComFairGNN, a novel framework designed to mitigate community-level bias in GNNs. Our approach employs a learnable coreset-based debiasing function that addresses bias arising from diverse local neighborhood distributions during GNNs neighborhood aggregation. Comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate our model's effectiveness in both accuracy and fairness metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at PAKDD 2025</p></details> |

We introduce several training improvements, particularly a novel closest assignment supervision method that dynamically adapts to the model's current state, significantly enhancing performance on problems with larger solution spaces. Our experiments demonstrate the suitability of variable-clause graph representations with recurrent neural network updates, which achieve good accuracy on SAT assignment prediction while reducing computational demands. We extend the base graph neural network into a diffusion model that facilitates incremental sampling and can be effectively combined with classical techniques like unit propagation. Through analysis of embedding space patterns and optimization trajectories, we show how these networks implicitly perform a process very similar to continuous relaxations of MaxSAT, offering an interpretable view of their reasoning process. This understanding guides our design choices and explains the ability of recurrent architectures to scale effectively at inference time beyond their training distribution, which we demonstrate with test-time scaling experiments.</p></details> |  |

Although graph neural networks have achieved remarkable progress in functional network analysis, challenges such as data scarcity and insufficient supervision persist. To address the limitations of limited training data and inadequate supervision, this paper proposes a novel model named PHGCL-DDGformer that integrates graph contrastive learning with graph transformers, effectively enhancing the representation learning capability for brain network classification tasks. To overcome the constraints of existing graph contrastive learning methods in brain network feature extraction, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy combining attribute masking and edge perturbation is implemented for data enhancement. Subsequently, a dual-domain graph transformer (DDGformer) module is constructed to integrate local and global information, where graph convolutional networks aggregate neighborhood features to capture local patterns while attention mechanisms extract global dependencies. Finally, a graph contrastive learning framework is established to maximize the consistency between positive and negative pairs, thereby obtaining high-quality graph representations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the PHGCL-DDGformer model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in brain network classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, uses tikz.sty</p></details> |

While particle-scale simulations provide detailed insights into these interactions, their computational cost is often prohibitive. Attended by researchers from both the granular materials (GM) and machine learning (ML) communities, a recent Lorentz Center Workshop on "Machine Learning for Discrete Granular Media" brought the ML community up to date with GM challenges. This position paper emerged from the workshop discussions. We define granular materials and identify seven key challenges that characterise their distinctive behaviour across various scales and regimes, ranging from gas-like to fluid-like and solid-like. Addressing these challenges is essential for developing robust and efficient digital twins for granular systems in various industrial applications. To showcase the potential of ML to the GM community, we present classical and emerging machine/deep learning techniques that have been, or could be, applied to granular materials. We reviewed sequence-based learning models for path-dependent constitutive behaviour, followed by encoder-decoder type models for representing high-dimensional data. We then explore graph neural networks and recent advances in neural operator learning. Lastly, we discuss model-order reduction and probabilistic learning techniques for high-dimensional parameterised systems, which are crucial for quantifying uncertainties arising from physics-based and data-driven models. We present a workflow aimed at unifying data structures and modelling pipelines and guiding readers through the selection, training, and deployment of ML surrogates for granular material simulations. Finally, we illustrate the workflow's practical use with two representative examples, focusing on granular materials in solid-like and fluid-like regimes.</p></details> | 35 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Designing Heterogeneous GNNs with Desired Permutation Properties for Wireless Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03906v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been designed for learning a variety of wireless policies, i.e., the mappings from environment parameters to decision variables, thanks to their superior performance, and the potential in enabling scalability and size generalizability. These merits are rooted in leveraging permutation prior, i.e., satisfying the permutation property of the policy to be learned (referred to as desired permutation property). Many wireless policies are with complicated permutation properties. To satisfy these properties, heterogeneous GNNs (HetGNNs) should be used to learn such policies. There are two critical factors that enable a HetGNN to satisfy a desired permutation property: constructing an appropriate heterogeneous graph and judiciously designing the architecture of the HetGNN. However, both the graph and the HetGNN are designed heuristically so far. In this paper, we strive to provide a systematic approach for the design to satisfy the desired permutation property. We first propose a method for constructing a graph for a policy, where the edges and their types are defined for the sake of satisfying complicated permutation properties. Then, we provide and prove three sufficient conditions to design a HetGNN such that it can satisfy the desired permutation property when learning over an appropriate graph. These conditions suggest a method of designing the HetGNN with desired permutation property by sharing the processing, combining, and pooling functions according to the types of vertices and edges of the graph. We take power allocation and hybrid precoding policies as examples for demonstrating how to apply the proposed methods and validating the impact of the permutation prior by simulations.</p></details> |  |

Graphs from real-world datasets often evolve over time, with newly emerging edges and dynamically changing node properties, posing a significant challenge for this problem. In response, temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have been developed to predict dynamic node properties from a stream of emerging edges. However, our analysis reveals that most TGNN-based methods are (a) far less effective without proper node features and, due to their complex model architectures, (b) vulnerable to distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose SPLASH, a simple yet powerful method for predicting node properties on edge streams under distribution shifts. Our key contributions are as follows: (1) we propose feature augmentation methods and an automatic feature selection method for edge streams, which improve the effectiveness of TGNNs, (2) we propose a lightweight MLP-based TGNN architecture that is highly efficient and robust under distribution shifts, and (3) we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, generalization, and qualitative performance of the proposed method and its competitors on dynamic node classification, dynamic anomaly detection, and node affinity prediction tasks across seven real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, To Appear in ICDE 2025</p></details> |

Therefore, they need to constantly monitor vast amounts of incoming and outgoing transactions. A particular challenge in detecting money laundering is that money launderers continuously adapt their tactics to evade detection. Hence, detection methods need constant fine-tuning. Traditional machine learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning the model on new data, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments. Continual learning methods may address this issue and enhance current anti-money laundering (AML) practices, by allowing models to incorporate new information while retaining prior knowledge. Research on continual graph learning for AML, however, is still scarce. In this review, we critically evaluate state-of-the-art continual graph learning approaches for AML applications. We categorise methods into replay-based, regularization-based, and architecture-based strategies within the graph neural network (GNN) framework, and we provide in-depth experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world AML data sets that showcase the effect of the different hyperparameters. Our analysis demonstrates that continual learning improves model adaptability and robustness in the face of extreme class imbalances and evolving fraud patterns. Finally, we outline key challenges and propose directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Engineering in Large-scale Networks with Generalizable Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24203v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic engineering (TE) in large-scale computer networks has become a fundamental yet challenging problem, owing to the swift growth of global-scale cloud wide-area networks or backbone low-Earth-orbit satellite constellations. To address the scalability issue of traditional TE algorithms, learning-based approaches have been proposed, showing potential of significant efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Nevertheless, the intrinsic limitations of existing learning-based methods hinder their practical application: they are not generalizable across diverse topologies and network conditions, incur excessive training overhead, and do not respect link capacities by default. This paper proposes TELGEN, a novel TE algorithm that learns to solve TE problems efficiently in large-scale networks, while achieving superior generalizability across diverse network conditions. TELGEN is based on the novel idea of transforming the problem of "predicting the optimal TE solution" into "predicting the optimal TE algorithm", which enables TELGEN to learn and efficiently approximate the end-to-end solving process of classical optimal TE algorithms. The learned algorithm is agnostic to the exact network topology or traffic patterns, and can efficiently solve TE problems given arbitrary inputs and generalize well to unseen topologies and demands. We trained and evaluated TELGEN on random and real-world networks with up to 5000 nodes and 106 links. TELGEN achieved less than 3% optimality gap while ensuring feasibility in all cases, even when the test network had up to 20x more nodes than the largest in training. It also saved up to 84% solving time than classical optimal solver, and could reduce training time per epoch and solving time by 2-4 orders of magnitude than latest learning algorithms on the largest networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backdoor Graph Condensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11025v4)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation has recently emerged as a prevalent technique to improve the training efficiency for graph neural networks (GNNs). It condenses a large graph into a small one such that a GNN trained on this small synthetic graph can achieve comparable performance to a GNN trained on the large graph. However, while existing graph condensation studies mainly focus on the best trade-off between graph size and the GNNs' performance (model utility), they overlook the security issues of graph condensation. To bridge this gap, we first explore backdoor attack against the GNNs trained on the condensed graphs. We introduce an effective backdoor attack against graph condensation, termed BGC. This attack aims to (1) preserve the condensed graph quality despite trigger injection, and (2) ensure trigger efficacy through the condensation process, achieving a high attack success rate. Specifically, BGC consistently updates triggers during condensation and targets representative nodes for poisoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. BGC achieves a high attack success rate (close to 1.0) and good model utility in all cases. Furthermore, the results against multiple defense methods demonstrate BGC's resilience under their defenses. Finally, we analyze the key hyperparameters that influence the attack performance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/JiahaoWuGit/BGC.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICDE ...</summary><p>ICDE 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

The latter consists of spray-based printing of cementitious plaster on a wall and is facilitated with the use of a robotic arm. The predictions are computed using the robotic arm trajectory features, such as position, velocity and direction, as well as the printing process parameters. The proposed approach, based on a particle representation of the wall domain and the end effector, allows for the adoption of a graph-based solution. The GNN model consists of an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and is trained using data from laboratory tests, while the hyperparameters are optimized by means of a Bayesian scheme. The aim of this model is to act as a simulator of the printing process, and ultimately used for the generation of the robotic arm trajectory and the optimization of the printing parameters, towards the materialization of an autonomous plastering process. The performance of the proposed model is assessed in terms of the prediction error against unseen ground truth data, which shows its generality in varied scenarios, as well as in comparison with the performance of an existing benchmark model. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the benchmark model, with notably better performance and enhanced error scaling across prediction steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inductive Graph Representation Learning with Quantum Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24111v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) present a promising approach for combining quantum computing with graph-structured data processing. While classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are renowned for their scalability and robustness, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum circuit designs, limiting their applicability to a narrower range of graph-structured problems, falling short of real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by the classical GraphSAGE approach, utilizing quantum models as aggregators. In this work, we integrate established techniques for inductive representation learning on graphs with parametrized quantum convolutional and pooling layers, effectively bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer is flexible, enabling tailored designs for specific problems. Benchmarked on a node regression task with the QM9 dataset, we demonstrate that our framework successfully models a non-trivial molecular dataset, achieving performance comparable to classical GNNs. In particular, we show that our quantum approach exhibits robust generalization across molecules with varying numbers of atoms without requiring circuit modifications, slightly outperforming classical GNNs. Furthermore, we numerically investigate the scalability of the QGNN framework. Specifically, we demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus in our architecture as the number of qubits increases, suggesting that the proposed quantum model can be extended to handle larger and more complex graph-based problems effectively.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

While recent years have witnessed significant advances in this field, there has been limited effort to consolidate these works into a comprehensive overview. This survey systematically reviews the evolution and current state of lane topology reasoning methods, categorizing them into three major paradigms: procedural modeling-based methods, aerial imagery-based methods, and onboard sensors-based methods. We analyze the progression from early rule-based approaches to modern learning-based solutions utilizing transformers, graph neural networks (GNNs), and other deep learning architectures. The paper examines standardized evaluation metrics, including road-level measures (APLS and TLTS score), and lane-level metrics (DET and TOP score), along with performance comparisons on benchmark datasets such as OpenLane-V2. We identify key technical challenges, including dataset availability and model efficiency, and outline promising directions for future research. This comprehensive review provides researchers and practitioners with insights into the theoretical frameworks, practical implementations, and emerging trends in lane topology reasoning for HD mapping applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE IV'25</p></details> |

However, optimizing donor-acceptor (D-A) combinations to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE) remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates large-scale pretraining of graph neural networks (GNNs) with a GPT-2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 2)-based reinforcement learning (RL) strategy to design OPV molecules with potentially high PCE. This approach produces candidate molecules with predicted efficiencies approaching 21\%, although further experimental validation is required. Moreover, we conducted a preliminary fragment-level analysis to identify structural motifs recognized by the RL model that may contribute to enhanced PCE, thus providing design guidelines for the broader research community. To facilitate continued discovery, we are building the largest open-source OPV dataset to date, expected to include nearly 3,000 donor-acceptor pairs. Finally, we discuss plans to collaborate with experimental teams on synthesizing and characterizing AI-designed molecules, which will provide new data to refine and improve our predictive and generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>AI fo...</summary><p>AI for Accelerated Materials Design - ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Traditional influence maximization strategies often fail to keep up with rapidly evolving relationships and structures, leading to missed opportunities and inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a novel learning-based approach integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) models. This hybrid framework captures both structural and temporal dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of candidate nodes for seed set selection. The bidirectional nature of BiLSTM allows our model to analyze patterns from both past and future network states, ensuring adaptability to changes over time. By dynamically adapting to graph evolution at each time snapshot, our approach improves seed set calculation efficiency, achieving an average of 90% accuracy in predicting potential seed nodes across diverse networks. This significantly reduces computational overhead by optimizing the number of nodes evaluated for seed selection. Our method is particularly effective in fields like viral marketing and social network analysis, where understanding temporal dynamics is crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, Accepted in AAAI25 to AI4TS Workshop@AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Graph neural networks extrapolate out-of-distribution for shortest paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19173v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks (NNs), despite their success and wide adoption, still struggle to extrapolate out-of-distribution (OOD), i.e., to inputs that are not well-represented by their training dataset. Addressing the OOD generalization gap is crucial when models are deployed in environments significantly different from the training set, such as applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on small graphs to large, real-world graphs. One promising approach for achieving robust OOD generalization is the framework of neural algorithmic alignment, which incorporates ideas from classical algorithms by designing neural architectures that resemble specific algorithmic paradigms (e.g. dynamic programming). The hope is that trained models of this form would have superior OOD capabilities, in much the same way that classical algorithms work for all instances. We rigorously analyze the role of algorithmic alignment in achieving OOD generalization, focusing on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to the canonical shortest path problem. We prove that GNNs, trained to minimize a sparsity-regularized loss over a small set of shortest path instances, exactly implement the Bellman-Ford (BF) algorithm for shortest paths. In fact, if a GNN minimizes this loss within an error of $\epsilon$, it implements the BF algorithm with an error of $O(\epsilon)$. Consequently, despite limited training data, these GNNs are guaranteed to extrapolate to arbitrary shortest-path problems, including instances of any size. Our empirical results support our theory by showing that NNs trained by gradient descent are able to minimize this loss and extrapolate in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple Feedfoward Neural Networks are Almost All You Need for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23621v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are everywhere -- from finance to healthcare -- and each domain brings its own unique complexities and structures. While advanced models like Transformers and graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, largely due to their success in tasks like language modeling, their added complexity is not always necessary. In our work, we show that simple feedforward neural networks (SFNNs) can achieve performance on par with, or even exceeding, these state-of-the-art models, while being simpler, smaller, faster, and more robust. Our analysis indicates that, in many cases, univariate SFNNs are sufficient, implying that modeling interactions between multiple series may offer only marginal benefits. Even when inter-series relationships are strong, a basic multivariate SFNN still delivers competitive results. We also examine some key design choices and offer guidelines on making informed decisions. Additionally, we critique existing benchmarking practices and propose an improved evaluation protocol. Although SFNNs may not be optimal for every situation (hence the ``almost'' in our title) they serve as a strong baseline that future time series forecasting methods should always be compared against.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Eq: Discovering Mathematical Equations using Graph Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23617v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to discover meaningful, accurate, and concise mathematical equations that describe datasets is valuable across various domains. Equations offer explicit relationships between variables, enabling deeper insights into underlying data patterns. Most existing equation discovery methods rely on genetic programming, which iteratively searches the equation space but is often slow and prone to overfitting. By representing equations as directed acyclic graphs, we leverage the use of graph neural networks to learn the underlying semantics of equations, and generate new, previously unseen equations. Although graph generative models have been shown to be successful in discovering new types of graphs in many fields, there application in discovering equations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose Graph-EQ, a deep graph generative model designed for efficient equation discovery. Graph-EQ uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to learn a rich latent representation of the equation space by training it on a large corpus of equations in an unsupervised manner. Instead of directly searching the equation space, we employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore this learned latent space. We show that the encoder-decoder architecture of Graph-Eq is able to accurately reconstruct input equations. Moreover, we show that the learned latent representation can be sampled and decoded into valid equations, including new and previously unseen equations in the training data. Finally, we assess Graph-Eq's ability to discover equations that best fit a dataset by exploring the latent space using Bayesian optimization. Latent space exploration is done on 20 dataset with known ground-truth equations, and Graph-Eq is shown to successfully discover the grountruth equation in the majority of datasets.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Krait: A Backdoor Attack Against Graph Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13068v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph prompt tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm to effectively transfer general graph knowledge from pre-trained models to various downstream tasks, particularly in few-shot contexts. However, its susceptibility to backdoor attacks, where adversaries insert triggers to manipulate outcomes, raises a critical concern. We conduct the first study to investigate such vulnerability, revealing that backdoors can disguise benign graph prompts, thus evading detection. We introduce Krait, a novel graph prompt backdoor. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic metric called label non-uniformity homophily to select poisoned candidates, significantly reducing computational complexity. To accommodate diverse attack scenarios and advanced attack types, we design three customizable trigger generation methods to craft prompts as triggers. We propose a novel centroid similarity-based loss function to optimize prompt tuning for attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Experiments on four real-world graphs demonstrate that Krait can efficiently embed triggers to merely 0.15% to 2% of training nodes, achieving high attack success rates without sacrificing clean accuracy. Notably, in one-to-one and all-to-one attacks, Krait can achieve 100% attack success rates by poisoning as few as 2 and 22 nodes, respectively. Our experiments further show that Krait remains potent across different transfer cases, attack types, and graph neural network backbones. Additionally, Krait can be successfully extended to the black-box setting, posing more severe threats. Finally, we analyze why Krait can evade both classical and state-of-the-art defenses, and provide practical insights for detecting and mitigating this class of attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SaTML'2025</p></details> |

Integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can enhance reasoning; however, existing methods typically demand costly fine-tuning or retrieve noisy KG information. Recent approaches leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate KG-based input embedding prefixes as soft prompts for LLMs but fail to account for question relevance, resulting in noisy prompts. Moreover, in MCQA tasks, the absence of relevant KG knowledge for certain answer options remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting (QAP), which incorporates question embeddings into GNN aggregation to dynamically assess KG relevance. QAP employs global attention to capture inter-option relationships, enriching soft prompts with inferred knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that QAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, the field lacks a standardized workflow that encompasses prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, ML interpretability, and polymer synthesizability. In this study, we introduce POINT$^{2}$ (POlymer INformatics Training and Testing), a comprehensive benchmark database and protocol designed to address these critical challenges. Leveraging the existing labeled datasets and the unlabeled PI1M dataset, a collection of approximately one million virtual polymers generated via a recurrent neural network trained on the realistic polymers, we develop an ensemble of ML models, including Quantile Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptrons with dropout, Graph Neural Networks, and pretrained large language models. These models are coupled with diverse polymer representations such as Morgan, MACCS, RDKit, Topological, Atom Pair fingerprints, and graph-based descriptors to achieve property predictions, uncertainty estimations, model interpretability, and template-based polymerization synthesizability across a spectrum of properties, including gas permeability, thermal conductivity, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, fractional free volume, and density. The POINT$^{2}$ database can serve as a valuable resource for the polymer informatics community for polymer discovery and optimization.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art approach for many high-impact, real-world graph applications. For feature-rich graphs, a prevalent practice involves utilizing a PM directly to generate features, without incorporating any domain adaptation techniques. Nevertheless, this practice is suboptimal because the node features extracted from PM are graph-agnostic and prevent GNNs from fully utilizing the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features, leading to a decline in GNNs performance. In this work, we seek to improve the node features obtained from a PM for downstream graph tasks and introduce TOUCHUP-G, which has several advantages. It is (a) General: applicable to any downstream graph task, including link prediction which is often employed in recommender systems; (b) Multi-modal: able to improve raw features of any modality (e.g. images, texts, audio); (c) Principled: it is closely related to a novel metric, feature homophily, which we propose to quantify the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features and we show that TOUCHUP-G can effectively shrink the discrepancy between the graph structure and node features; (d) Effective: achieving state-of-the-art results on four real-world datasets spanning different tasks and modalities.</p></details> | SIGIR 2024 |

The objective is to find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while simultaneously minimizing the costs associated with the experts. Different definitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and algorithmic solutions. We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that captures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task coverage and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation variants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution methods. We show that solutions based on the QUBO formulations of TeamFormation problems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines. Furthermore, we show that QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks can effectively learn representations of experts and skills to enable transfer learning, allowing node embeddings from one problem instance to be efficiently applied to another.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, it is critical to develop predictive models that can support clinicians to determine whether or not a patient will return to the hospital in a relatively short period of time (e.g, 30-days). Nowadays, it is possible to collect both structured (electronic health records - EHR) and unstructured information (clinical notes) about a patient hospital event, all potentially containing relevant information for a predictive model. However, their integration is challenging. In this work we explore the combination of clinical notes and EHRs to predict 30-day hospital readmissions. We address the representation of the various types of information available in the EHR data, as well as exploring LLMs to characterize the clinical notes. We collect both information sources as the nodes of a graph neural network (GNN). Our model achieves an AUROC of 0.72 and a balanced accuracy of 66.7\%, highlighting the importance of combining the multimodal information.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADAGE: Active Defenses Against GNN Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00065v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance in various real-world applications, such as drug discovery, traffic states prediction, and recommendation systems. The fact that building powerful GNNs requires a large amount of training data, powerful computing resources, and human expertise turns the models into lucrative targets for model stealing attacks. Prior work has revealed that the threat vector of stealing attacks against GNNs is large and diverse, as an attacker can leverage various heterogeneous signals ranging from node labels to high-dimensional node embeddings to create a local copy of the target GNN at a fraction of the original training costs. This diversity in the threat vector renders the design of effective and general defenses challenging and existing defenses usually focus on one particular stealing setup. Additionally, they solely provide means to identify stolen model copies rather than preventing the attack. To close this gap, we propose the first and general Active Defense Against GNN Extraction (ADAGE). By analyzing the queries to the GNN, tracking their diversity in terms of proximity to different communities identified in the underlying graph, and increasing the defense strength with the growing fraction of communities that have been queried, ADAGE can prevent stealing in all common attack setups. Our extensive experimental evaluation using six benchmark datasets, four GNN models, and three types of adaptive attackers shows that ADAGE penalizes attackers to the degree of rendering stealing impossible, whilst not harming predictive performance for legitimate users. ADAGE, thereby, contributes towards securely sharing valuable GNNs in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Not a...</summary><p>Not all authors have given their explicit consent</p></details> |

However, predicting the prognosis of cancer patients can be a challenging task due to tumor heterogeneity and intra-patient variability, and the complexity of analyzing WSIs. These images are extremely large, containing billions of pixels, making direct processing computationally expensive and requiring specialized methods to extract relevant information. Additionally, multiple WSIs from the same patient may capture different tumor regions, some being more informative than others. This raises a fundamental question: Should we use all WSIs to characterize the patient, or should we identify the most representative slide for prognosis? Our work seeks to answer this question by performing a comparison of various strategies for predicting survival at the WSI and patient level. The former treats each WSI as an independent sample, mimicking the strategy adopted in other works, while the latter comprises methods to either aggregate the predictions of the several WSIs or automatically identify the most relevant slide using multiple-instance learning (MIL). Additionally, we evaluate different Graph Neural Networks architectures under these strategies. We conduct our experiments using the MMIST-ccRCC dataset, which comprises patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Our results show that MIL-based selection improves accuracy, suggesting that choosing the most representative slide benefits survival prediction.</p></details> |  |

We propose StyleMe3D, a holistic framework for 3D GS style transfer that integrates multi-modal style conditioning, multi-level semantic alignment, and perceptual quality enhancement. Our key insights include: (1) optimizing only RGB attributes preserves geometric integrity during stylization; (2) disentangling low-, medium-, and high-level semantics is critical for coherent style transfer; (3) scalability across isolated objects and complex scenes is essential for practical deployment. StyleMe3D introduces four novel components: Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD), leveraging Stable Diffusion's latent space for semantic alignment; Contrastive Style Descriptor (CSD) for localized, content-aware texture transfer; Simultaneously Optimized Scale (SOS) to decouple style details and structural coherence; and 3D Gaussian Quality Assessment (3DG-QA), a differentiable aesthetic prior trained on human-rated data to suppress artifacts and enhance visual harmony. Evaluated on NeRF synthetic dataset (objects) and tandt db (scenes) datasets, StyleMe3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving geometric details (e.g., carvings on sculptures) and ensuring stylistic consistency across scenes (e.g., coherent lighting in landscapes), while maintaining real-time rendering. This work bridges photorealistic 3D GS and artistic stylization, unlocking applications in gaming, virtual worlds, and digital art.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages; Project page: https://styleme3d.github.io/</p></details> |

Existing methods lack a systematic way to reliably extract the interpretable underlying intrinsic concepts. To address this challenge, we present ICE, short for Intrinsic Concept Extraction, a novel framework that exclusively utilises a T2I model to automatically and systematically extract intrinsic concepts from a single image. ICE consists of two pivotal stages. In the first stage, ICE devises an automatic concept localization module to pinpoint relevant text-based concepts and their corresponding masks within the image. This critical stage streamlines concept initialization and provides precise guidance for subsequent analysis. The second stage delves deeper into each identified mask, decomposing the object-level concepts into intrinsic concepts and general concepts. This decomposition allows for a more granular and interpretable breakdown of visual elements. Our framework demonstrates superior performance on intrinsic concept extraction from a single image in an unsupervised manner.

To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion bridge model for 3D brain image translation between T1w MRI and DTI modalities. Our model learns to generate high-quality DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) images from T1w images and vice versa, enabling cross-modality data augmentation and reducing the need for extensive DTI acquisition. We evaluate our approach using perceptual similarity, pixel-level agreement, and distributional consistency metrics, demonstrating strong performance in capturing anatomical structures and preserving information on white matter integrity. The practical utility of the synthetic data is validated through sex classification and Alzheimer's disease classification tasks, where the generated images achieve comparable performance to real data. Our diffusion bridge model offers a promising solution for improving neuroimaging datasets and supporting clinical decision-making, with the potential to significantly impact neuroimaging research and clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic and memorizes excessively; comparatively, multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, in our tasks, we find that to elicit randomness from the Transformer without hurting coherence, it is better to inject noise right at the input layer (via a method we dub hash-conditioning) rather than defer to temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and softmax-based sampling.

However, its availability is often hindered by the requirements of data capturing devices, manual labor, and suitable actors. This situation restricts the diversity, expressiveness, and control over the resulting models. This work aims to demonstrate that a semantically controllable generative network can provide enhanced control over the digital face modeling process. To enhance diversity beyond the limited human faces scanned in a controlled setting, we introduce a novel data generation pipeline that creates a high-quality 3D face database using a pre-trained diffusion model. Our proposed normalization module converts synthesized data from the diffusion model into high-quality scanned data. Using the 44,000 face models we obtained, we further developed an efficient GAN-based generator. This generator accepts semantic attributes as input, and generates geometry and albedo. It also allows continuous post-editing of attributes in the latent space. Our asset refinement component subsequently creates physically-based facial assets. We introduce a comprehensive system designed for creating and editing high-quality face assets. Our proposed model has undergone extensive experiment, comparison and evaluation. We also integrate everything into a web-based interactive tool. We aim to make this tool publicly available with the release of the paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRAGON: Distributional Rewards Optimize Diffusion Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15217v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Distributional RewArds for Generative OptimizatioN (DRAGON), a versatile framework for fine-tuning media generation models towards a desired outcome. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization (DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate either individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with a broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and distribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct novel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples to create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP are used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text versus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores them to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and leverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For evaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20 different reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP score, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare instance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple FAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an 81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets indeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality win rate without training on human preference annotations. As such, DRAGON exhibits a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for improving human-perceived quality. Sound examples at https://ml-dragon.github.io/web.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamDistribution: Learning Prompt Distribution for Diverse In-distribution Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14216v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The popularization of Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models enables the generation of high-quality images from text descriptions. However, generating diverse customized images with reference visual attributes remains challenging. This work focuses on personalizing T2I diffusion models at a more abstract concept or category level, adapting commonalities from a set of reference images while creating new instances with sufficient variations. We introduce a solution that allows a pretrained T2I diffusion model to learn a set of soft prompts, enabling the generation of novel images by sampling prompts from the learned distribution. These prompts offer text-guided editing capabilities and additional flexibility in controlling variation and mixing between multiple distributions. We also show the adaptability of the learned prompt distribution to other tasks, such as text-to-3D. Finally we demonstrate effectiveness of our approach through quantitative analysis including automatic evaluation and human assessment.

While recent advances have shown promising results in 4D avatar creation, existing methods either require extensive multiview data or struggle with shape accuracy and identity consistency. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive system that leverages shape, image, and video priors to create full-view, animatable avatars. Our approach first obtains initial coarse shape through 3D-GAN inversion. Then, it enhances multiview textures using depth-guided warping signals for cross-view consistency with the help of the image diffusion model. To handle expression animation, we incorporate a video prior with synchronized driving signals across viewpoints. We further introduce a Consistent-Inconsistent training to effectively handle data inconsistencies during 4D reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior quality compared to the prior art, while maintaining consistency across different viewpoints and expressions.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSPO: Direct Semantic Preference Optimization for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15176v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have improved Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR), but existing methods lack human feedback integration, risking misalignment with human preference and may leading to artifacts, hallucinations and harmful content generation. To this end, we are the first to introduce human preference alignment into Real-ISR, a technique that has been successfully applied in Large Language Models and Text-to-Image tasks to effectively enhance the alignment of generated outputs with human preferences. Specifically, we introduce Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) into Real-ISR to achieve alignment, where DPO serves as a general alignment technique that directly learns from the human preference dataset. Nevertheless, unlike high-level tasks, the pixel-level reconstruction objectives of Real-ISR are difficult to reconcile with the image-level preferences of DPO, which can lead to the DPO being overly sensitive to local anomalies, leading to reduced generation quality. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose Direct Semantic Preference Optimization (DSPO) to align instance-level human preferences by incorporating semantic guidance, which is through two strategies: (a) semantic instance alignment strategy, implementing instance-level alignment to ensure fine-grained perceptual consistency, and (b) user description feedback strategy, mitigating hallucinations through semantic textual feedback on instance-level images. As a plug-and-play solution, DSPO proves highly effective in both one-step and multi-step SR frameworks.</p></details> |  |

However, controlling these large models for image restoration usually requires a large number of high-quality images and immense computational resources for training, which is costly and not privacy-friendly. In this paper, we find that the well-trained large T2I model (i.e., Flux) is able to produce a variety of high-quality images aligned with real-world distributions, offering an unlimited supply of training samples to mitigate the above issue. Specifically, we proposed a training data construction pipeline for image restoration, namely FluxGen, which includes unconditional image generation, image selection, and degraded image simulation. A novel light-weighted adapter (FluxIR) with squeeze-and-excitation layers is also carefully designed to control the large Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based T2I model so that reasonable details can be restored. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method enables the Flux model to adapt effectively to real-world image restoration tasks, achieving superior scores and visual quality on both synthetic and real-world degradation datasets - at only about 8.5\% of the training cost compared to current approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Real-Time Rendering of Glints in the Presence of Area Lights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13611v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world materials are characterized by a glittery appearance. Reproducing this effect in physically based renderings is a challenging problem due to its discrete nature, especially in real-time applications which require a consistently low runtime. Recent work focuses on glittery appearance illuminated by infinitesimally small light sources only. For light sources like the sun this approximation is a reasonable choice. In the real world however, all light sources are fundamentally area light sources. In this paper, we derive an efficient method for rendering glints illuminated by spatially constant diffuse area lights in real time. To this end, we require an adequate estimate for the probability of a single microfacet to be correctly oriented for reflection from the source to the observer. A good estimate is achieved either using linearly transformed cosines (LTC) for large light sources, or a locally constant approximation of the normal distribution for small spherical caps of light directions. To compute the resulting number of reflecting microfacets, we employ a counting model based on the binomial distribution. In the evaluation, we demonstrate the visual accuracy of our approach, which is easily integrated into existing real-time rendering frameworks, especially if they already implement shading for area lights using LTCs and a counting model for glint shading under point and directional illumination. Besides the overhead of the preexisting constituents, our method adds little to no additional overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Artificial compressibility method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable density](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15151v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel artificial compressibility technique to approximate the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable fluid properties such as density and dynamical viscosity. The proposed scheme used the couple pressure and momentum, equal to the density times the velocity, as primary unknowns. It also involves an adequate treatment of the diffusive operator such that treating the nonlinear convective term explicitly leads to a scheme with time independent stiffness matrices that is suitable for pseudo-spectral methods. The stability and temporal convergence of the semi-implicit version of the scheme is established under the hypothesis that the density is approximated with a method that conserves the minimum-maximum principle. Numerical illustrations confirm that both the semi-implicit and explicit scheme are stable and converge with order one under classic CFL condition. Moreover, the proposed scheme is shown to perform better than a momentum based pressure projection method, previously introduced by one of the authors, on setups involving gravitational waves and immiscible multi-fluids in a cylinder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Compression Autoencoder for Efficient High-Resolution Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10733v7)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Deep Compression Autoencoder (DC-AE), a new family of autoencoder models for accelerating high-resolution diffusion models. Existing autoencoder models have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression ratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for high spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by introducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our models to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders; (2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases training strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high spatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the autoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the reconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we achieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet 512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup on H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely used SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.

This paper presents a novel framework that leverages diffusion models to automate and scale up aerobatic trajectory generation. Our key innovation is the decomposition of complex maneuvers into aerobatic primitives, which are short frame sequences that act as building blocks, featuring critical aerobatic behaviors for tractable trajectory synthesis. The model learns aerobatic primitives using historical trajectory observations as dynamic priors to ensure motion continuity, with additional conditional inputs (target waypoints and optional action constraints) integrated to enable user-editable trajectory generation. During model inference, classifier guidance is incorporated with batch sampling to achieve obstacle avoidance. Additionally, the generated outcomes are refined through post-processing with spatial-temporal trajectory optimization to ensure dynamical feasibility. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments have validated the key component designs of our method, demonstrating its feasibility for deploying on real drones to achieve long-horizon aerobatic flight.</p></details> |  |

The investigation is primarily concerned with practical scenarios where data is collected subsequent to an incident. We establish the uniqueness of either the spatial or the temporal component of the source, provided that the temporal component exhibits an asymptotic expansion at infinity. Taking anomalous diffusion as a typical example, we gather the asymptotic behavior of one of the following quantities: the concentration on partial interior region or at a point inside the region, or the flux on partial boundary or at a point on the boundary. The proof is based on the asymptotic expansion of the solution to the fractional diffusion-wave equation. Notably, our approach does not rely on the conventional vanishing conditions for the source components. We also observe that the extent of uniqueness is dependent on the fractional order.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revision submitted to arxiv on 2025/4/21</p></details> |
| **[An optimization-based coupling of reduced order models with efficient reduced adjoint basis generation approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14450v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization-based coupling (OBC) is an attractive alternative to traditional Lagrange multiplier approaches in multiple modeling and simulation contexts. However, application of OBC to time-dependent problems has been hindered by the computational cost of finding the stationary points of the associated Lagrangian, which requires primal and adjoint solves. This issue can be mitigated by using OBC in conjunction with computationally efficient reduced order models (ROM). To demonstrate the potential of this combination, in this paper we develop an optimization-based ROM-ROM coupling for a transient advection-diffusion transmission problem. We pursue the ``optimize-then-reduce'' path towards solving the minimization problem at each timestep and solve reduced-space adjoint system of equations, where the main challenge in this formulation is the generation of adjoint snapshots and reduced bases for the adjoint systems required by the optimizer. One of the main contributions of the paper is a new technique for efficient adjoint snapshot collection for gradient-based optimizers in the context of optimization-based ROM-ROM couplings. We present numerical studies demonstrating the accuracy of the approach along with comparison between various approaches for selecting a reduced order basis for the adjoint systems, including decay of snapshot energy, average iteration counts, and timings.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Recent advancements have positioned diffusion models as effective MDE tools by framing the challenge as a conditional image generation task. Despite their progress, these methods often struggle with accurately reconstructing distant depths, due largely to the imbalanced distribution of depth values and an over-reliance on spatial-domain features. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VistaDepth, a novel framework that integrates adaptive frequency-domain feature enhancements with an adaptive weight-balancing mechanism into the diffusion process. Central to our approach is the Latent Frequency Modulation (LFM) module, which dynamically refines spectral responses in the latent feature space, thereby improving the preservation of structural details and reducing noisy artifacts. Furthermore, we implement an adaptive weighting strategy that modulates the diffusion loss in real-time, enhancing the model's sensitivity towards distant depth reconstruction. These innovations collectively result in superior depth perception performance across both distance and detail. Experimental evaluations confirm that VistaDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion-based MDE techniques, particularly excelling in the accurate reconstruction of distant regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, conventional beamforming optimization techniques struggle in the complex LAE environments. In this context, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) methods provide a promising solution. In this article, we first introduce the core concepts of LAE and the roles of beamforming in advanced communication technologies for LAE. We then examine their interrelation, followed by an analysis of the limitations of conventional beamforming methods. Next, we provide an overview of how GenAI methods enhance the process of beamforming, with a focus on its applications in LAE. Furthermore, we present a case study using a generative diffusion model (GDM)-based algorithm to enhance the performance of aerial collaborative beamforming-enabled remote secure communications in LAE and simulation results verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Current methods recover the details from low-light images while inevitably amplifying the noise in images, resulting in poor visual quality. In this paper, we firstly introduce DiT into the low-light enhancement task and design a novel Structure-guided Diffusion Transformer based Low-light image enhancement (SDTL) framework. We compress the feature through wavelet transform to improve the inference efficiency of the model and capture the multi-directional frequency band. Then we propose a Structure Enhancement Module (SEM) that uses structural prior to enhance the texture and leverages an adaptive fusion strategy to achieve more accurate enhancement effect. In Addition, we propose a Structure-guided Attention Block (SAB) to pay more attention to texture-riched tokens and avoid interference from noisy areas in noise prediction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance on several popular datasets, validating the effectiveness of SDTL in improving image quality and the potential of DiT in low-light enhancement tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |

Although existing generative watermarking techniques have proposed corresponding solutions, most methods require substantial computational overhead and training costs. In addition, some methods have limitations in robustness when handling variable-length inputs. To tackle these challenges, we propose \textsc{SOLIDO}, a novel generative watermarking method that integrates parameter-efficient fine-tuning with speech watermarking through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for speech diffusion models. Concretely, the watermark encoder converts the watermark to align with the input of diffusion models. To achieve precise watermark extraction from variable-length inputs, the watermark decoder based on depthwise separable convolution is designed for watermark recovery. To further enhance speech generation performance and watermark extraction capability, we propose a speech-driven lightweight fine-tuning strategy, which reduces computational overhead through LoRA. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method ensures high-fidelity watermarked speech even at a large capacity of 2000 bps. Furthermore, against common individual and compound speech attacks, our SOLIDO achieves a maximum average extraction accuracy of 99.20\% and 98.43\%, respectively. It surpasses other state-of-the-art methods by nearly 23\% in resisting time-stretching attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Locomotive Crowd Behavior Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04756v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling and reproducing crowd behaviors are important in various domains including psychology, robotics, transport engineering and virtual environments. Conventional methods have focused on synthesizing momentary scenes, which have difficulty in replicating the continuous nature of real-world crowds. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for automatically generating continuous, realistic crowd trajectories with heterogeneous behaviors and interactions among individuals. We first design a crowd emitter model. To do this, we obtain spatial layouts from single input images, including a segmentation map, appearance map, population density map and population probability, prior to crowd generation. The emitter then continually places individuals on the timeline by assigning independent behavior characteristics such as agents' type, pace, and start/end positions using diffusion models. Next, our crowd simulator produces their long-term locomotions. To simulate diverse actions, it can augment their behaviors based on a Markov chain. As a result, our overall framework populates the scenes with heterogeneous crowd behaviors by alternating between the proposed emitter and simulator. Note that all the components in the proposed framework are user-controllable. Lastly, we propose a benchmark protocol to evaluate the realism and quality of the generated crowds in terms of the scene-level population dynamics and the individual-level trajectory accuracy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively models diverse crowd behavior patterns and generalizes well across different geographical environments.

Existing methods struggle with layout discontinuity, entity identity drift, and implausible interaction dynamics due to unconstrained cross-attention mechanisms and inadequate physics-aware reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose DyST-XL, a \textbf{training-free} framework that enhances off-the-shelf text-to-video models (e.g., CogVideoX-5B) through frame-aware control. DyST-XL integrates three key innovations: (1) A Dynamic Layout Planner that leverages large language models (LLMs) to parse input prompts into entity-attribute graphs and generates physics-aware keyframe layouts, with intermediate frames interpolated via trajectory optimization; (2) A Dual-Prompt Controlled Attention Mechanism that enforces localized text-video alignment through frame-aware attention masking, achieving the precise control over individual entities; and (3) An Entity-Consistency Constraint strategy that propagates first-frame feature embeddings to subsequent frames during denoising, preserving object identity without manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that DyST-XL excels in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly improving performance on complex prompts and bridging a crucial gap in training-free video synthesis.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

This representation is learned in a self-supervised fashion using an adapted FactorVAE. We train our model with a carefully designed unlabeled dataset, avoiding possible biases induced by human-generated labels. Our model demonstrates strong disentanglement and interpretability by effectively encoding material appearance and illumination, despite the absence of explicit supervision. Then, we use our representation as guidance for training a lightweight IP-Adapter to condition a diffusion pipeline that transfers the appearance of one or more images onto a target geometry, and allows the user to further edit the resulting appearance. Our approach offers fine-grained control over the generated results: thanks to the well-structured compact latent space, users can intuitively manipulate attributes such as hue or glossiness in image space to achieve the desired final appearance.</p></details> |  |

One effective solution involves watermarking the generated images. Existing methods primarily focus on ensuring that watermark embedding does not degrade the model performance. However, they often overlook critical challenges in real-world deployment scenarios, such as the complexity of watermark key management, user-defined generation parameters, and the difficulty of verification by arbitrary third parties. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Shading++, a diffusion model watermarking method tailored for real-world deployment. We propose a double-channel design that leverages pseudorandom error-correcting codes to encode the random seed required for watermark pseudorandomization, achieving performance-lossless watermarking under a fixed watermark key and overcoming key management challenges. Additionally, we model the distortions introduced during generation and inversion as an additive white Gaussian noise channel and employ a novel soft decision decoding strategy during extraction, ensuring strong robustness even when generation parameters vary. To enable third-party verification, we incorporate public key signatures, which provide a certain level of resistance against forgery attacks even when model inversion capabilities are fully disclosed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian Shading++ not only maintains performance losslessness but also outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness, making it a more practical solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

These intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation, followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity.

Instead of training separate models for individual tasks, our approach is trained once on our new AnyInsertion dataset--comprising 120K prompt-image pairs covering diverse tasks such as person, object, and garment insertion--and effortlessly generalizes to a wide range of insertion scenarios. Such a challenging setting requires capturing both identity features and fine-grained details, while allowing versatile local adaptations in style, color, and texture. To this end, we propose to leverage the multimodal attention of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to support both mask- and text-guided editing. Furthermore, we introduce an in-context editing mechanism that treats the reference image as contextual information, employing two prompting strategies to harmonize the inserted elements with the target scene while faithfully preserving their distinctive features. Extensive experiments on AnyInsertion, DreamBooth, and VTON-HD benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing alternatives, underscoring its great potential in real-world applications such as creative content generation, virtual try-on, and scene composition.</p></details> |  |
| **[PIV-FlowDiffuser:Transfer-learning-based denoising diffusion models for PIV](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14952v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning algorithms have significantly reduced the computational time and improved the spatial resolution of particle image velocimetry~(PIV). However, the models trained on synthetic datasets might have a degraded performance on practical particle images due to domain gaps. As a result, special residual patterns are often observed for the vector fields of deep learning-based estimators. To reduce the special noise step-by-step, we employ a denoising diffusion model~(FlowDiffuser) for PIV analysis. And the data-hungry iterative denoising diffusion model is trained via a transfer learning strategy, resulting in our PIV-FlowDiffuser method. Specifically, (1) pre-training a FlowDiffuser model with multiple optical flow datasets of the computer vision community, such as Sintel, KITTI, etc; (2) fine-tuning the pre-trained model on synthetic PIV datasets. Note that the PIV images are upsampled by a factor of two to resolve the small-scale turbulent flow structures. The visualized results indicate that our PIV-FlowDiffuser effectively suppresses the noise patterns. Therefore, the denoising diffusion model reduces the average end-point error~($AEE$) by 59.4% over RAFT256-PIV baseline on the classic Cai's dataset. Besides, PIV-FlowDiffuser exhibits enhanced generalization performance on unseen particle images due to transfer learning. Overall, this study highlights the transfer-learning-based denoising diffusion models for PIV. And a detailed implementation is recommended for interested readers in the repository https://github.com/Zhu-Qianyu/PIV-FlowDiffuser.</p></details> |  |

As a result, we are able to process a large number of frames using video diffusion with computation bottleneck similar to image diffusion. This also makes the training video batch sizes significantly higher (batch sizes become comparable to image diffusion training). We also propose an anti-drifting sampling method that generates frames in inverted temporal order with early-established endpoints to avoid exposure bias (error accumulation over iterations). Finally, we show that existing video diffusion models can be finetuned with FramePack, and their visual quality may be improved because the next-frame prediction supports more balanced diffusion schedulers with less extreme flow shift timesteps.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack</p></details> |
| **[TWIG: Two-Step Image Generation using Segmentation Masks in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14933v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In today's age of social media and marketing, copyright issues can be a major roadblock to the free sharing of images. Generative AI models have made it possible to create high-quality images, but concerns about copyright infringement are a hindrance to their abundant use. As these models use data from training images to generate new ones, it is often a daunting task to ensure they do not violate intellectual property rights. Some AI models have even been noted to directly copy copyrighted images, a problem often referred to as source copying. Traditional copyright protection measures such as watermarks and metadata have also proven to be futile in this regard. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-step image generation model inspired by the conditional diffusion model. The first step involves creating an image segmentation mask for some prompt-based generated images. This mask embodies the shape of the image. Thereafter, the diffusion model is asked to generate the image anew while avoiding the shape in question. This approach shows a decrease in structural similarity from the training image, i.e. we are able to avoid the source copying problem using this approach without expensive retraining of the model or user-centered prompt generation techniques. This makes our approach the most computationally inexpensive approach to avoiding both copyright infringement and source copying for diffusion model-based image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, preprint</p></details> |
| **[Kernel-learning parameter prediction and evaluation in algebraic multigrid method for several PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14930v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the application of kernel learning methods for parameter prediction and evaluation in the Algebraic Multigrid Method (AMG), focusing on several Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problems. AMG is an efficient iterative solver for large-scale sparse linear systems, particularly those derived from elliptic and parabolic PDE discretizations. However, its performance heavily relies on numerous parameters, which are often set empirically and are highly sensitive to AMG's effectiveness. Traditional parameter optimization methods are either computationally expensive or lack theoretical support. To address this, we propose a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)-based strategy to optimize AMG parameters and introduce evaluation metrics to assess their effectiveness. Trained on small-scale datasets, GPR predicts nearly optimal parameters, bypassing the time-consuming parameter sweeping process. We also use kernel learning techniques to build a kernel function library and determine the optimal kernel function through linear combination, enhancing prediction accuracy. In numerical experiments, we tested typical PDEs such as the constant-coefficient Poisson equation, variable-coefficient Poisson equation, diffusion equation, and Helmholtz equation. Results show that GPR-predicted parameters match grid search results in iteration counts while significantly reducing computational time. A comprehensive analysis using metrics like mean squared error, prediction interval coverage, and Bayesian information criterion confirms GPR's efficiency and reliability. These findings validate GPR's effectiveness in AMG parameter optimization and provide theoretical support for AMG's practical application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation and inference in error-in-operator model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11834v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many statistical problems can be reduced to a linear inverse problem in which only a noisy version of the operator is available. Particular examples include random design regression, deconvolution problem, instrumental variable regression, functional data analysis, error-in-variable regression, drift estimation in stochastic diffusion, and many others. The pragmatic plug-in approach can be well justified in the classical asymptotic setup with a growing sample size. However, recent developments in high dimensional inference reveal some new features of this problem. In high dimensional linear regression with a random design, the plug-in approach is questionable but the use of a simple ridge penalization yields a benign overfitting phenomenon; see \cite{baLoLu2020}, \cite{ChMo2022}, \cite{NoPuSp2024}. This paper revisits the general Error-in-Operator problem for finite samples and high dimension of the source and image spaces. A particular focus is on the choice of a proper regularization. We show that a simple ridge penalty (Tikhonov regularization) works properly in the case when the operator is more regular than the signal. In the opposite case, some model reduction technique like spectral truncation should be applied.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Low-Cost Video Editing with Lightweight Adaptors and Temporal-Aware Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04606v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation using diffusion models have enabled cost-effective video-editing applications by leveraging pre-trained models, eliminating the need for resource-intensive training. However, the frame-independence of T2I generation often results in poor temporal consistency. Existing methods address this issue through temporal layer fine-tuning or inference-based temporal propagation, but these approaches suffer from high training costs or limited temporal coherence. To address these challenges, we propose a General and Efficient Adapter (GE-Adapter) that integrates temporal-spatial and semantic consistency with Baliteral DDIM inversion. This framework introduces three key components: (1) Frame-based Temporal Consistency Blocks (FTC Blocks) to capture frame-specific features and enforce smooth inter-frame transitions via temporally-aware loss functions; (2) Channel-dependent Spatial Consistency Blocks (SCD Blocks) employing bilateral filters to enhance spatial coherence by reducing noise and artifacts; and (3) Token-based Semantic Consistency Module (TSC Module) to maintain semantic alignment using shared prompt tokens and frame-specific tokens. Our method significantly improves perceptual quality, text-image alignment, and temporal coherence, as demonstrated on the MSR-VTT dataset. Additionally, it achieves enhanced fidelity and frame-to-frame coherence, offering a practical solution for T2V editing.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods that rely on global depth normalization treat all depth values equally, which can amplify noise in pseudo-labels and reduce distillation effectiveness. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of depth normalization strategies in the context of pseudo-label distillation. Our study shows that, under recent distillation paradigms (e.g., shared-context distillation), normalization is not always necessary, as omitting it can help mitigate the impact of noisy supervision. Furthermore, rather than focusing solely on how depth information is represented, we propose Cross-Context Distillation, which integrates both global and local depth cues to enhance pseudo-label quality. We also introduce an assistant-guided distillation strategy that incorporates complementary depth priors from a diffusion-based teacher model, enhancing supervision diversity and robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://distill-any-depth-official.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical and Step-Layer-Wise Tuning of Attention Specialty for Multi-Instance Synthesis in Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10148v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) generation models often struggle with multi-instance synthesis (MIS), where they must accurately depict multiple distinct instances in a single image based on complex prompts detailing individual features. Traditional MIS control methods for UNet architectures like SD v1.5/SDXL fail to adapt to DiT-based models like FLUX and SD v3.5, which rely on integrated attention between image and text tokens rather than text-image cross-attention. To enhance MIS in DiT, we first analyze the mixed attention mechanism in DiT. Our token-wise and layer-wise analysis of attention maps reveals a hierarchical response structure: instance tokens dominate early layers, background tokens in middle layers, and attribute tokens in later layers. Building on this observation, we propose a training-free approach for enhancing MIS in DiT-based models with hierarchical and step-layer-wise attention specialty tuning (AST). AST amplifies key regions while suppressing irrelevant areas in distinct attention maps across layers and steps, guided by the hierarchical structure. This optimizes multimodal interactions by hierarchically decoupling the complex prompts with instance-based sketches. We evaluate our approach using upgraded sketch-based layouts for the T2I-CompBench and customized complex scenes. Both quantitative and qualitative results confirm our method enhances complex layout generation, ensuring precise instance placement and attribute representation in MIS.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Lurks Within? Concept Auditing for Shared Diffusion Models at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14815v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images from text prompts. With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content, such as copyrighted material, private individuals, or harmful content. Despite the increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled model and 690 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18-40x compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures |
| **[A Basic Evaluation of Neural Networks Trained with the Error Diffusion Learning Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14814v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial neural networks are powerful tools capable of addressing various tasks. Although the backpropagation algorithm has become a standard training method for these neural networks, its lack of biological plausibility has inspired the development of alternative learning approaches. One such alternative is Kaneko's Error Diffusion Learning Algorithm (EDLA), a biologically motivated approach wherein a single global error signal diffuses throughout a network composed of paired excitatory-inhibitory sublayers, thereby eliminating the necessity for layer-wise backpropagation. This study presents a contemporary formulation of the EDLA framework and evaluates its effectiveness through parity check, regression, and image classification tasks. Our experimental results indicate that EDLA networks can consistently achieve high accuracy across these benchmarks, with performance efficiency and convergence speed notably influenced by the choice of learning rate, neuron count, and network depth. Further investigation of the internal representations formed by EDLA networks reveals their capacity for meaningful feature extraction, similar to traditional neural networks. These results suggest that EDLA is a biologically motivated alternative for training feedforward networks and will motivate future work on extending this method to biologically inspired neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scene4U: Hierarchical Layered 3D Scene Reconstruction from Single Panoramic Image for Your Immerse Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00387v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstruction of immersive and realistic 3D scenes holds significant practical importance in various fields of computer vision and computer graphics. Typically, immersive and realistic scenes should be free from obstructions by dynamic objects, maintain global texture consistency, and allow for unrestricted exploration. The current mainstream methods for image-driven scene construction involves iteratively refining the initial image using a moving virtual camera to generate the scene. However, previous methods struggle with visual discontinuities due to global texture inconsistencies under varying camera poses, and they frequently exhibit scene voids caused by foreground-background occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel layered 3D scene reconstruction framework from panoramic image, named Scene4U. Specifically, Scene4U integrates an open-vocabulary segmentation model with a large language model to decompose a real panorama into multiple layers. Then, we employs a layered repair module based on diffusion model to restore occluded regions using visual cues and depth information, generating a hierarchical representation of the scene. The multi-layer panorama is then initialized as a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation, followed by layered optimization, which ultimately produces an immersive 3D scene with semantic and structural consistency that supports free exploration. Scene4U outperforms state-of-the-art method, improving by 24.24% in LPIPS and 24.40% in BRISQUE, while also achieving the fastest training speed. Additionally, to demonstrate the robustness of Scene4U and allow users to experience immersive scenes from various landmarks, we build WorldVista3D dataset for 3D scene reconstruction, which contains panoramic images of globally renowned sites. The implementation code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/Scene4U .</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, 11 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Existing methods, including modular-based and end-to-end approaches, often lack robust spatial reasoning capabilities. Unlike recent point-based and flow-based affordance methods that focus on dense spatial representations or trajectory modeling, we propose A0, a hierarchical affordance-aware diffusion model that decomposes manipulation tasks into high-level spatial affordance understanding and low-level action execution. A0 leverages the Embodiment-Agnostic Affordance Representation, which captures object-centric spatial affordances by predicting contact points and post-contact trajectories. A0 is pre-trained on 1 million contact points data and fine-tuned on annotated trajectories, enabling generalization across platforms. Key components include Position Offset Attention for motion-aware feature extraction and a Spatial Information Aggregation Layer for precise coordinate mapping. The model's output is executed by the action execution module. Experiments on multiple robotic systems (Franka, Kinova, Realman, and Dobot) demonstrate A0's superior performance in complex tasks, showcasing its efficiency, flexibility, and real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in high-fidelity sensor technologies have improved the ability to capture detailed traffic dynamics, yet such systems remain scarce and costly. In contrast, conventional traffic sensors are widely deployed but suffer from relatively coarse-grain data resolution, potentially impeding accurate analysis of stop-and-go waves. This article explores whether generative AI models can enhance the resolution of conventional traffic sensor to approximate the quality of high-fidelity observations. We present a novel approach using a conditional diffusion denoising model, designed to reconstruct fine-grained traffic speed field from radar-based conventional sensors via iterative refinement. We introduce a new dataset, I24-WaveX, comprising 132 hours of data from both low and high-fidelity sensor systems, totaling over 2 million vehicle miles traveled. Our approach leverages this dataset to formulate the traffic measurement enhancement problem as a spatio-temporal super-resolution task. We demonstrate that our model can effectively reproduce the patterns of stop-and-go waves, achieving high accuracy in capturing these critical traffic dynamics. Our results show promising advancements in traffic data enhancement, offering a cost-effective way to leverage existing low spatio-temporal resolution sensor networks for improved traffic analysis and management. We also open-sourced our trained model and code to facilitate further research and applications.</p></details> |  |

K-space data employed for training are typically multi-coil and inherently noisy. Although DL-based reconstruction methods trained on fully sampled data can enable high reconstruction quality, obtaining large, noise-free datasets is impractical. We leverage Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) for denoising. We evaluate two DL-based reconstruction methods: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Model-Based Deep Learning (MoDL). We evaluate the impact of denoising on the performance of these DL-based methods in solving accelerated multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. The experiments were carried out on T2-weighted brain and fat-suppressed proton-density knee scans. We observed that self-supervised denoising enhances the quality and efficiency of MRI reconstructions across various scenarios. Specifically, employing denoised images rather than noisy counterparts when training DL networks results in lower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), higher structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) across different SNR levels, including 32dB, 22dB, and 12dB for T2-weighted brain data, and 24dB, 14dB, and 4dB for fat-suppressed knee data. Overall, we showed that denoising is an essential pre-processing technique capable of improving the efficacy of DL-based MRI reconstruction methods under diverse conditions. By refining the quality of input data, denoising enables training more effective DL networks, potentially bypassing the need for noise-free reference MRI scans.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose DC4CR (Diffusion Control for Cloud Removal), a novel multimodal diffusion-based framework for cloud removal in remote sensing imagery. Our method introduces prompt-driven control, allowing selective removal of thin and thick clouds without relying on pre-generated cloud masks, thereby enhancing preprocessing efficiency and model adaptability. Additionally, we integrate low-rank adaptation for computational efficiency, subject-driven generation for improved generalization, and grouped learning to enhance performance on small datasets. Designed as a plug-and-play module, DC4CR seamlessly integrates into existing cloud removal models, providing a scalable and robust solution. Extensive experiments on the RICE and CUHK-CR datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving superior cloud removal across diverse conditions. This work presents a practical and efficient approach for remote sensing image processing with broad real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we present an automated methodology integrating edge detection with generative diffusion models to effectively identify grains, eliminate noise, and connect broken segments in alignment with predicted grain boundaries. Due to the limited availability of adequate images preventing the training of deep machine learning models, a new seven-stage methodology is employed to generate synthetic TEM images for training. This concept-oriented synthetic data approach can be extended to any field of interest where the scarcity of data is a challenge. The presented model was applied to various metals with average grain sizes down to the nanoscale, producing grain morphologies from low-resolution TEM images that are comparable to those obtained from advanced and demanding experimental techniques with an average accuracy of 97.23%.</p></details> | 19 Pages, 5 Figures |

In this paper, we expand the application of the concept of Affordance from human-centered image composition tasks to a more general object-scene composition framework, addressing the complex interplay between foreground objects and background scenes. Following the principle of Affordance, we define the affordance-aware object insertion task, which aims to seamlessly insert any object into any scene with various position prompts. To address the limited data issue and incorporate this task, we constructed the SAM-FB dataset, which contains over 3 million examples across more than 3,000 object categories. Furthermore, we propose the Mask-Aware Dual Diffusion (MADD) model, which utilizes a dual-stream architecture to simultaneously denoise the RGB image and the insertion mask. By explicitly modeling the insertion mask in the diffusion process, MADD effectively facilitates the notion of affordance.

Using anisotropic interpolation operators the estimator is elementwise separated with respect to the single directions in space and time leading to adaptive, anisotropic mesh refinement in a natural way. To prevent spurious oscillations the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method is applied to stabilize the underlying system in the case of high P\'eclet numbers. Efficiency and robustness of the underlying algorithm are demonstrated for different goal functionals. The directional error indicators quantify anisotropy of the solution with respect to the goal, and produce meshes that efficiently capture sharp layers. Numerical examples show the superiority of the proposed approach over isotropic adaptive and global mesh refinement using established benchmarks for convection-dominated transport.</p></details> |  |

ECG sensing is non-invasive and relatively easy to acquire, and yet it is still cumbersome for holter monitoring tests that may span over hours and even days. A possible alternative in this context is Photoplethysmography (PPG): An optically-based signal that measures blood volume fluctuations, as typically sensed by conventional ``wearable devices''. While PPG presents clear advantages in acquisition, convenience, and cost-effectiveness, ECG provides more comprehensive information, allowing for a more precise detection of heart conditions. This implies that a conversion from PPG to ECG, as recently discussed in the literature, inherently involves an unavoidable level of uncertainty. In this paper we introduce a novel methodology for addressing the PPG-2-ECG conversion, and offer an enhanced classification of cardiovascular conditions using the given PPG, all while taking into account the uncertainties arising from the conversion process. We provide a mathematical justification for our proposed computational approach, and present empirical studies demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, analytical solutions to the underlying physical equations are rarely available, and numerical solutions require high computational resources. Latest developments in the field of physics-based Deep Learning have led to promising efficiency improvements but still suffer from limited generalization capabilities and low accuracy compared to numerical solvers. In this work, we introduce Metamizer, a novel neural optimizer that iteratively solves a wide range of physical systems with high accuracy by minimizing a physics-based loss function. To this end, our approach leverages a scale-invariant architecture that enhances gradient descent updates to accelerate convergence. Since the neural network itself acts as an optimizer, training this neural optimizer falls into the category of meta-optimization approaches. We demonstrate that Metamizer achieves unprecedented accuracy for deep learning based approaches - sometimes approaching machine precision - across multiple PDEs after training on the Laplace, advection-diffusion and incompressible Navier-Stokes equation as well as on cloth simulations. Remarkably, the model also generalizes to PDEs that were not covered during training such as the Poisson, wave and Burgers equation. Our results suggest that Metamizer could have a profound impact on future numerical solvers, paving the way for fast and accurate neural physics simulations without the need for retraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches rely on spatial visual tokens, where image patches are encoded and arranged according to a spatial order (e.g., raster scan). However, we show that spatial tokens lack the recursive structure inherent to languages, hence form an impossible language for LLM to master. In this paper, we build a proper visual language by leveraging diffusion timesteps to learn discrete, recursive visual tokens. Our proposed tokens recursively compensate for the progressive attribute loss in noisy images as timesteps increase, enabling the diffusion model to reconstruct the original image at any timestep. This approach allows us to effectively integrate the strengths of LLMs in autoregressive reasoning and diffusion models in precise image generation, achieving seamless multimodal comprehension and generation within a unified framework. Extensive experiments show that we achieve superior performance for multimodal comprehension and generation simultaneously compared with other MLLMs. Project Page: https://DDT-LLaMA.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Unlike scalar and static entropy measures such as Shannon entropy, these functionals act directly on probability densities and provide a topographical representation of information structure across the support of the distribution. The framework captures periodic and self-referential aspects of information distribution and encodes them through functional operators governed by nonlinear differential equations. When applied recursively, these operators induce a spectral diffusion process governed by the heat equation, leading to convergence toward a Gaussian characteristic function. This convergence theorem provides a unified analytical foundation for describing the long-term dynamics of information under cyclic modulation. The proposed framework offers new tools for analyzing the temporal evolution of information in systems characterized by periodic structure, stochastic feedback, and delayed interaction, with applications in artificial neural networks, communication theory, and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that empower robots with semantic reflection ability for failure, translating semantic reflection into how to correct fine-grained robotic actions remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we build the Phoenix framework, which leverages motion instruction as a bridge to connect high-level semantic reflection with low-level robotic action correction. In this motion-based self-reflection framework, we start with a dual-process motion adjustment mechanism with MLLMs to translate the semantic reflection into coarse-grained motion instruction adjustment. To leverage this motion instruction for guiding how to correct fine-grained robotic actions, a multi-task motion-conditioned diffusion policy is proposed to integrate visual observations for high-frequency robotic action correction. By combining these two models, we could shift the demand for generalization capability from the low-level manipulation policy to the MLLMs-driven motion adjustment model and facilitate precise, fine-grained robotic action correction. Utilizing this framework, we further develop a lifelong learning method to automatically improve the model's capability from interactions with dynamic environments. The experiments conducted in both the RoboMimic simulation and real-world scenarios prove the superior generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation tasks.

We propose a diffusion transformer (DiT) based framework, DreamActor-M1, with hybrid guidance to overcome these limitations. For motion guidance, our hybrid control signals that integrate implicit facial representations, 3D head spheres, and 3D body skeletons achieve robust control of facial expressions and body movements, while producing expressive and identity-preserving animations. For scale adaptation, to handle various body poses and image scales ranging from portraits to full-body views, we employ a progressive training strategy using data with varying resolutions and scales. For appearance guidance, we integrate motion patterns from sequential frames with complementary visual references, ensuring long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions during complex movements. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works, delivering expressive results for portraits, upper-body, and full-body generation with robust long-term consistency.

| **[Preference Diffusion for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13117v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems predict personalized item rankings based on user preference distributions derived from historical behavior data. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have gained attention in recommendation for their ability to model complex distributions, yet current DM-based recommenders often rely on traditional objectives like mean squared error (MSE) or recommendation objectives, which are not optimized for personalized ranking tasks or fail to fully leverage DM's generative potential. To address this, we propose PreferDiff, a tailored optimization objective for DM-based recommenders. PreferDiff transforms BPR into a log-likelihood ranking objective and integrates multiple negative samples to better capture user preferences. Specifically, we employ variational inference to handle the intractability through minimizing the variational upper bound and replaces MSE with cosine error to improve alignment with recommendation tasks. Finally, we balance learning generation and preference to enhance the training stability of DMs. PreferDiff offers three key benefits: it is the first personalized ranking loss designed specifically for DM-based recommenders and it improves ranking and faster convergence by addressing hard negatives. We also prove that it is theoretically connected to Direct Preference Optimization which indicates that it has the potential to align user preferences in DM-based recommenders via generative modeling. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks validate its superior recommendation performance and commendable general sequential recommendation capabilities.

Timely disclosure and mitigation of security vulnerabilities in T2I models are crucial for ensuring the safe deployment of generative models. We explore a novel training-free backdoor poisoning paradigm through model editing, which is recently employed for knowledge updating in large language models. Nevertheless, we reveal the potential security risks posed by model editing techniques to image generation models. In this work, we establish the principles for backdoor attacks based on model editing, and propose a relationship-driven precise backdoor poisoning method, REDEditing. Drawing on the principles of equivalent-attribute alignment and stealthy poisoning, we develop an equivalent relationship retrieval and joint-attribute transfer approach that ensures consistent backdoor image generation through concept rebinding. A knowledge isolation constraint is proposed to preserve benign generation integrity. Our method achieves an 11\% higher attack success rate compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Remarkably, adding just one line of code enhances output naturalness while improving backdoor stealthiness by 24\%. This work aims to heighten awareness regarding this security vulnerability in editable image generation models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

However, SAR images exhibit complex backscatter patterns and speckle noise, which necessitate expertise for interpretation. Research on translating SAR images into optical-like representations has been conducted to aid the interpretation of SAR data. Nevertheless, existing studies have predominantly utilized low-resolution satellite imagery datasets and have largely been based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which are known for their training instability and low fidelity. To overcome these limitations of low-resolution data usage and GAN-based approaches, this letter introduces a conditional image-to-image translation approach based on Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM). We conducted comprehensive experiments on the MSAW dataset, a paired SAR and optical images collection of 0.5m Very-High-Resolution (VHR). The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses both the Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) and the GAN-based models in diverse perceptual quality metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We introduce a single-view generalizable Human Gaussian Model (HGM), which employs a novel generate-then-refine pipeline with the guidance from human body prior and diffusion prior. Our approach uses a ControlNet to refine rendered back-view images from coarse predicted human Gaussians, then uses the refined image along with the input image to reconstruct refined human Gaussians. To mitigate the potential generation of unrealistic human poses and shapes, we incorporate human priors from the SMPL-X model as a dual branch, propagating image features from the SMPL-X volume to the image Gaussians using sparse convolution and attention mechanisms. Given that the initial SMPL-X estimation might be inaccurate, we gradually refine it with our HGM model. We validate our approach on several publicly available datasets. Our method surpasses previous methods in both novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction. Our approach also exhibits strong generalization for cross-dataset evaluation and in-the-wild images.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025: https://jinnan-chen.github.io/projects/HGM/</p></details> |

However, applying these advances to 3D generation presents three key challenges: the unordered nature of 3D data conflicts with sequential next-token prediction paradigm, conventional vector quantization approaches incur substantial compression loss when applied to 3D meshes, and the lack of efficient scaling strategies for higher resolution latent prediction. To address these challenges, we introduce MAR-3D, which integrates a pyramid variational autoencoder with a cascaded masked auto-regressive transformer (Cascaded MAR) for progressive latent upscaling in the continuous space. Our architecture employs random masking during training and auto-regressive denoising in random order during inference, naturally accommodating the unordered property of 3D latent tokens. Additionally, we propose a cascaded training strategy with condition augmentation that enables efficiently up-scale the latent token resolution with fast convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAR-3D not only achieves superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods but also exhibits enhanced scaling capabilities compared to joint distribution modeling approaches (e.g., diffusion transformers).</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Highlight: https://jinnan-chen.github.io/projects/MAR-3D/</p></details> |

Optical flow supervision is a promising approach to address this, with prior works commonly employing warping-based strategies that avoid explicit flow matching. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation, FlowLoss, which directly compares flow fields extracted from generated and ground-truth videos. To account for the unreliability of flow estimation under high-noise conditions in diffusion, we propose a noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates the flow loss across denoising steps. Experiments on robotic video datasets suggest that FlowLoss improves motion stability and accelerates convergence in early training stages. Our findings offer practical insights for incorporating motion-based supervision into noise-conditioned generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SUDO: Enhancing Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Self-Supervised Direct Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14534v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous text-to-image diffusion models typically employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance pre-trained base models. However, this approach primarily minimizes the loss of mean squared error (MSE) at the pixel level, neglecting the need for global optimization at the image level, which is crucial for achieving high perceptual quality and structural coherence. In this paper, we introduce Self-sUpervised Direct preference Optimization (SUDO), a novel paradigm that optimizes both fine-grained details at the pixel level and global image quality. By integrating direct preference optimization into the model, SUDO generates preference image pairs in a self-supervised manner, enabling the model to prioritize global-level learning while complementing the pixel-level MSE loss. As an effective alternative to supervised fine-tuning, SUDO can be seamlessly applied to any text-to-image diffusion model. Importantly, it eliminates the need for costly data collection and annotation efforts typically associated with traditional direct preference optimization methods. Through extensive experiments on widely-used models, including Stable Diffusion 1.5 and XL, we demonstrate that SUDO significantly enhances both global and local image quality.

| **[Enhancing OOD Detection Using Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16525v3)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection algorithms have been developed to identify unknown samples or objects in real-world deployments. One line of work related to OOD detection propose utilizing auxiliary datasets to train OOD detectors, thereby enhancing the performance of OOD detection. Recently, researchers propose to leverage Stable Diffusion (SD) to generate outliers in the pixel space, which may complicate network training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an Outlier Aware Learning (OAL) framework, which synthesizes OOD training data in the latent space. This improvement enables us to train the network with only a few synthesized outliers. Besides, to regularize the model's decision boundary, we develop a mutual information-based contrastive learning module (MICL) that amplifies the distinction between In-Distribution (ID) and collected OOD features. Moreover, we develop a knowledge distillation module to prevent the degradation of ID classification accuracy when training with OOD data. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamID: High-Fidelity and Fast diffusion-based Face Swapping via Triplet ID Group Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14509v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce DreamID, a diffusion-based face swapping model that achieves high levels of ID similarity, attribute preservation, image fidelity, and fast inference speed. Unlike the typical face swapping training process, which often relies on implicit supervision and struggles to achieve satisfactory results. DreamID establishes explicit supervision for face swapping by constructing Triplet ID Group data, significantly enhancing identity similarity and attribute preservation. The iterative nature of diffusion models poses challenges for utilizing efficient image-space loss functions, as performing time-consuming multi-step sampling to obtain the generated image during training is impractical. To address this issue, we leverage the accelerated diffusion model SD Turbo, reducing the inference steps to a single iteration, enabling efficient pixel-level end-to-end training with explicit Triplet ID Group supervision. Additionally, we propose an improved diffusion-based model architecture comprising SwapNet, FaceNet, and ID Adapter. This robust architecture fully unlocks the power of the Triplet ID Group explicit supervision. Finally, to further extend our method, we explicitly modify the Triplet ID Group data during training to fine-tune and preserve specific attributes, such as glasses and face shape. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of identity similarity, pose and expression preservation, and image fidelity. Overall, DreamID achieves high-quality face swapping results at 512*512 resolution in just 0.6 seconds and performs exceptionally well in challenging scenarios such as complex lighting, large angles, and occlusions.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in high-quality video generation, scaling them to 2K resolution remains computationally prohibitive due to quadratic growth in memory and processing costs. In this work, we propose Turbo2K, an efficient and practical framework for generating detail-rich 2K videos while significantly improving training and inference efficiency. First, Turbo2K operates in a highly compressed latent space, reducing computational complexity and memory footprint, making high-resolution video synthesis feasible. However, the high compression ratio of the VAE and limited model size impose constraints on generative quality. To mitigate this, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that enables a smaller student model to inherit the generative capacity of a larger, more powerful teacher model. Our analysis reveals that, despite differences in latent spaces and architectures, DiTs exhibit structural similarities in their internal representations, facilitating effective knowledge transfer. Second, we design a hierarchical two-stage synthesis framework that first generates multi-level feature at lower resolutions before guiding high-resolution video generation. This approach ensures structural coherence and fine-grained detail refinement while eliminating redundant encoding-decoding overhead, further enhancing computational efficiency.Turbo2K achieves state-of-the-art efficiency, generating 5-second, 24fps, 2K videos with significantly reduced computational cost. Compared to existing methods, Turbo2K is up to 20$\times$ faster for inference, making high-resolution video generation more scalable and practical for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage at https://jingjingrenabc.github.io/turbo2k/</p></details> |

However, due to the complex and diverse pathological features of medical images and the imbalanced class distribution in medical data, generating high-quality and diverse medical images from limited data is significantly challenging. Additionally, to fully leverage the information in limited data, such as anatomical structure information and generate more structurally stable medical images while avoiding distortion or inconsistency. In this paper, in order to enhance the clinical relevance of generated data and improve the interpretability of the model, we propose a novel medical image generation framework, which generates independent pathological and structural features based on causal disentanglement and utilizes text-guided modeling of pathological features to regulate the generation of counterfactual images. First, we achieve feature separation through causal disentanglement and analyze the interactions between features. Here, we introduce group supervision to ensure the independence of pathological and identity features. Second, we leverage a diffusion model guided by pathological findings to model pathological features, enabling the generation of diverse counterfactual images. Meanwhile, we enhance accuracy by leveraging a large language model to extract lesion severity and location from medical reports. Additionally, we improve the performance of the latent diffusion model on long-tailed categories through initial noise optimization.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a two-time-scale dynamical model for the centrally administered network, where opinions evolve faster while the network's degree distribution changes more slowly. Using a mean-field approximation, we establish conditions for a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium where all LLMs remain truthful. We provide approximation guarantees for the mean-field approximation and a singularly perturbed approximation of the two-time-scale system. To mitigate hallucination and improve the influence of truthful nodes, we propose a reputation-based preferential attachment mechanism that reconfigures the network based on LLMs' evaluations of their neighbors. Numerical experiments on an open-source LLM (LLaMA-3.1-8B) validate the efficacy of our preferential attachment mechanism and demonstrate the optimization of a cost function for the two-time-scale system.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a new infinite family of coding schemes, which we name RLIM, that require each 1-bit to be followed by at least i consecutive 0-bits, where i is any chosen positive integer. This enhances ISI mitigation and improves error correction capabilities compared to existing ISI-mitigating channel codes. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the codebooks derived from the proposed RLIM scheme significantly reduce bit error rate compared to prominent coding methods. Simulation results also reveal that an important constraint in RLIM codes is redundant under zero-drift conditions, removal of which makes them equivalent to run-length-limited (RLL) codes. Notably, despite this equivalence, the proposed family of RLIM coding schemes retains a distinct power optimization constraint and employs a specialized error correction algorithm, preserving its unique character and advantages. Furthermore, in diffusion-based channels with time-varying drift, the previously redundant constraint becomes critical for ensuring robust detection, thus demonstrating the enhanced applicability of proposed RLIM codes for such channels as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, generating high-quality 360-degree panoramic images and videos remains a challenging task due to the severe distortions introduced by equirectangular projection (ERP). Existing approaches either fine-tune pretrained diffusion models on limited ERP datasets or attempt tuning-free methods that still rely on ERP latent representations, leading to discontinuities near the poles. In this paper, we introduce SphereDiff, a novel approach for seamless 360-degree panoramic image and video generation using state-of-the-art diffusion models without additional tuning. We define a spherical latent representation that ensures uniform distribution across all perspectives, mitigating the distortions inherent in ERP. We extend MultiDiffusion to spherical latent space and propose a spherical latent sampling method to enable direct use of pretrained diffusion models. Moreover, we introduce distortion-aware weighted averaging to further improve the generation quality in the projection process. Our method outperforms existing approaches in generating 360-degree panoramic content while maintaining high fidelity, making it a robust solution for immersive AR/VR applications.

The common application of a kernel estimator for a conditional expectation in the calibration condition results in a McKean-Vlasov (MV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) with non-standard coefficients. The primary challenges lie in certain mean-field terms in the drift and diffusion coefficients and the $1/2$-H\"{o}lder regularity of the diffusion coefficient. We establish the well-posedness of this equation for a fixed but arbitrarily small bandwidth of the kernel estimator. Moreover, we prove a strong propagation of chaos result, ensuring convergence of the particle system under a condition on the Feller ratio and up to a critical time. For the numerical simulation, we employ an Euler-Maruyama scheme for the log-spot process and a full truncation Euler scheme for the CIR volatility process. Under certain conditions on the inputs and the Feller ratio, we prove strong convergence of the Euler-Maruyama scheme with rate $1/2$ in time, up to a logarithmic factor. Numerical experiments illustrate the convergence of the discretisation scheme and validate the propagation of chaos in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Prompting for One-shot Controllable Video Editing without Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14335v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-shot controllable video editing (OCVE) is an important yet challenging task, aiming to propagate user edits that are made -- using any image editing tool -- on the first frame of a video to all subsequent frames, while ensuring content consistency between edited frames and source frames. To achieve this, prior methods employ DDIM inversion to transform source frames into latent noise, which is then fed into a pre-trained diffusion model, conditioned on the user-edited first frame, to generate the edited video. However, the DDIM inversion process accumulates errors, which hinder the latent noise from accurately reconstructing the source frames, ultimately compromising content consistency in the generated edited frames. To overcome it, our method eliminates the need for DDIM inversion by performing OCVE through a novel perspective based on visual prompting. Furthermore, inspired by consistency models that can perform multi-step consistency sampling to generate a sequence of content-consistent images, we propose a content consistency sampling (CCS) to ensure content consistency between the generated edited frames and the source frames. Moreover, we introduce a temporal-content consistency sampling (TCS) based on Stein Variational Gradient Descent to ensure temporal consistency across the edited frames. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | accepted by cvpr2025 |

However, existing research primarily addresses single-source search problems, overlooking the complexities of real-world urban scenarios where both the location and quantity of hazardous sources remain unknown. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Likelihood-Weighted Cooperative Infotaxis (DLW-CI) approach for consumer drone networks. Our approach enhances multi-drone collaboration in AISs by combining infotaxis (a cognitive search strategy) with optimized source term estimation and an innovative cooperative mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a novel source term estimation method that utilizes multiple parallel particle filters, with each filter dedicated to estimating the parameters of a potentially unknown source within the search scene. Furthermore, we develop a cooperative mechanism based on dynamic likelihood weights to prevent multiple drones from simultaneously estimating and searching for the same source, thus optimizing the energy efficiency and search coverage of the consumer AIS. Experimental results demonstrate that the DLW-CI approach significantly outperforms baseline methods regarding success rate, accuracy, and root mean square error, particularly in scenarios with relatively few sources, regardless of the presence of obstacles. Also, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified in a diffusion scenario generated by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Research findings indicate that our approach could improve source estimation accuracy and search efficiency by consumer drone-based AISs, making a valuable contribution to environmental safety monitoring applications within smart city infrastructure.</p></details> |  |

Driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents hold the potential to empower the creation, maintenance, and evolution of mobile metaverses. Currently, AI agents are primarily constructed using cloud-based LLMs and VLMs. However, several challenges hinder their effective implementation, including high service latency and potential sensitive data leakage during perception and processing. In this paper, we develop an edge-cloud collaboration-based federated AI agent construction framework in mobile metaverses. Specifically, Edge Servers (ESs), acting as agent infrastructures, collaboratively create agent modules in a distributed manner. The cloud server then integrates these modules into AI agents and deploys them at the edge, thereby enabling low-latency AI agent services for users. Considering that ESs may exhibit dynamic levels of willingness to participate in federated AI agent construction, we design a two-period dynamic contract model to continuously motivate ESs to participate in agent module creation, effectively addressing the dynamic information asymmetry between the cloud server and the ESs. Furthermore, we propose an Enhanced Diffusion Model-based Soft Actor-Critic (EDMSAC) algorithm to efficiently generate optimal dynamic contracts, in which dynamic structured pruning is applied to DM-based actor networks to enhance denoising efficiency and policy learning performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the EDMSAC algorithm and the proposed contract model.</p></details> |  |
| **[RadioDiff-Inverse: Diffusion Enhanced Bayesian Inverse Estimation for ISAC Radio Map Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14298v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio maps (RMs) are essential for environment-aware communication and sensing, providing location-specific wireless channel information. Existing RM construction methods often rely on precise environmental data and base station (BS) locations, which are not always available in dynamic or privacy-sensitive environments. While sparse measurement techniques reduce data collection, the impact of noise in sparse data on RM accuracy is not well understood. This paper addresses these challenges by formulating RM construction as a Bayesian inverse problem under coarse environmental knowledge and noisy sparse measurements. Although maximum a posteriori (MAP) filtering offers an optimal solution, it requires a precise prior distribution of the RM, which is typically unavailable. To solve this, we propose RadioDiff-Inverse, a diffusion-enhanced Bayesian inverse estimation framework that uses an unconditional generative diffusion model to learn the RM prior. This approach not only reconstructs the spatial distribution of wireless channel features but also enables environmental structure perception, such as building outlines, and location of BS just relay on pathloss, through integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Remarkably, RadioDiff-Inverse is training-free, leveraging a pre-trained model from Imagenet without task-specific fine-tuning, which significantly reduces the training cost of using generative large model in wireless networks. Experimental results demonstrate that RadioDiff-Inverse achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy of RM construction and environmental reconstruction, and robustness against noisy sparse sampling.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[From Missing Pieces to Masterpieces: Image Completion with Context-Adaptive Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14294v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image completion is a challenging task, particularly when ensuring that generated content seamlessly integrates with existing parts of an image. While recent diffusion models have shown promise, they often struggle with maintaining coherence between known and unknown (missing) regions. This issue arises from the lack of explicit spatial and semantic alignment during the diffusion process, resulting in content that does not smoothly integrate with the original image. Additionally, diffusion models typically rely on global learned distributions rather than localized features, leading to inconsistencies between the generated and existing image parts. In this work, we propose ConFill, a novel framework that introduces a Context-Adaptive Discrepancy (CAD) model to ensure that intermediate distributions of known and unknown regions are closely aligned throughout the diffusion process. By incorporating CAD, our model progressively reduces discrepancies between generated and original images at each diffusion step, leading to contextually aligned completion. Moreover, ConFill uses a new Dynamic Sampling mechanism that adaptively increases the sampling rate in regions with high reconstruction complexity. This approach enables precise adjustments, enhancing detail and integration in restored areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConFill outperforms current methods, setting a new benchmark in image completion.</p></details> | Accepted in TPAMI |
| **[Edge-preserving noise for diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01540v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical generative diffusion models learn an isotropic Gaussian denoising process, treating all spatial regions uniformly, thus neglecting potentially valuable structural information in the data. Inspired by the long-established work on anisotropic diffusion in image processing, we present a novel edge-preserving diffusion model that generalizes over existing isotropic models by considering a hybrid noise scheme. In particular, we introduce an edge-aware noise scheduler that varies between edge-preserving and isotropic Gaussian noise. We show that our model's generative process converges faster to results that more closely match the target distribution. We demonstrate its capability to better learn the low-to-mid frequencies within the dataset, which plays a crucial role in representing shapes and structural information. Our edge-preserving diffusion process consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unconditional image generation. It is also particularly more robust for generative tasks guided by a shape-based prior, such as stroke-to-image generation. We present qualitative and quantitative results (FID and CLIP score) showing consistent improvements of up to 30% for both tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[LL-Gaussian: Low-Light Scene Reconstruction and Enhancement via Gaussian Splatting for Novel View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10331v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel view synthesis (NVS) in low-light scenes remains a significant challenge due to degraded inputs characterized by severe noise, low dynamic range (LDR) and unreliable initialization. While recent NeRF-based approaches have shown promising results, most suffer from high computational costs, and some rely on carefully captured or pre-processed data--such as RAW sensor inputs or multi-exposure sequences--which severely limits their practicality. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with competitive visual fidelity; however, existing 3DGS-based methods struggle with low-light sRGB inputs, resulting in unstable Gaussian initialization and ineffective noise suppression. To address these challenges, we propose LL-Gaussian, a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and enhancement from low-light sRGB images, enabling pseudo normal-light novel view synthesis. Our method introduces three key innovations: 1) an end-to-end Low-Light Gaussian Initialization Module (LLGIM) that leverages dense priors from learning-based MVS approach to generate high-quality initial point clouds; 2) a dual-branch Gaussian decomposition model that disentangles intrinsic scene properties (reflectance and illumination) from transient interference, enabling stable and interpretable optimization; 3) an unsupervised optimization strategy guided by both physical constrains and diffusion prior to jointly steer decomposition and enhancement. Additionally, we contribute a challenging dataset collected in extreme low-light environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of LL-Gaussian. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, LL-Gaussian achieves up to 2,000 times faster inference and reduces training time to just 2%, while delivering superior reconstruction and rendering quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sunhao242.github.io/LL-Gaussian_web.github.io/</p></details> |

However, existing methods lack the flexibility for precise topology control, limiting navigation of the backbone space. We present ProtPainter, a diffusion-based approach for generating protein backbones conditioned on 3D curves. ProtPainter follows a two-stage process: curve-based sketching and sketch-guided backbone generation. For the first stage, we propose CurveEncoder, which predicts secondary structure annotations from a curve to parametrize sketch generation. For the second stage, the sketch guides the generative process in Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Modeling (DDPM) to generate backbones. During this process, we further introduce a fusion scheduling scheme, Helix-Gating, to control the scaling factors. To evaluate, we propose the first benchmark for topology-conditioned protein generation, introducing Protein Restoration Task and a new metric, self-consistency Topology Fitness (scTF). Experiments demonstrate ProtPainter's ability to generate topology-fit (scTF > 0.8) and designable (scTM > 0.5) backbones, with drawing and dragging tasks showcasing its flexibility and versatility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for Video Saliency Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14267v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video saliency prediction is crucial for downstream applications, such as video compression and human-computer interaction. With the flourishing of multimodal learning, researchers started to explore multimodal video saliency prediction, including audio-visual and text-visual approaches. Auditory cues guide the gaze of viewers to sound sources, while textual cues provide semantic guidance for understanding video content. Integrating these complementary cues can improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. Therefore, we attempt to simultaneously analyze visual, auditory, and textual modalities in this paper, and propose TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video saliency prediction. TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image generation task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts saliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large multimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and introduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate image-text response maps. It is used as conditional information to guide the model to localize the visual regions that are semantically related to the textual description. Regarding the auditory modality, it is used as another conditional information for directing the model to focus on salient regions indicated by sounds. At the same time, since the diffusion transformer (DiT) directly concatenates the conditional information with the timestep, which may affect the estimation of the noise level. To achieve effective conditional guidance, we propose Saliency-DiT, which decouples the conditional information from the timestep. Experimental results show that TAVDiff outperforms existing methods, improving 1.03\%, 2.35\%, 2.71\% and 0.33\% on SIM, CC, NSS and AUC-J metrics, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative emulation of chaotic dynamics with coherent prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14264v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven emulation of nonlinear dynamics is challenging due to long-range skill decay that often produces physically unrealistic outputs. Recent advances in generative modeling aim to address these issues by providing uncertainty quantification and correction. However, the quality of generated simulation remains heavily dependent on the choice of conditioning priors. In this work, we present an efficient generative framework for dynamics emulation, unifying principles of turbulence with diffusion-based modeling: Cohesion. Specifically, our method estimates large-scale coherent structure of the underlying dynamics as guidance during the denoising process, where small-scale fluctuation in the flow is then resolved. These coherent priors are efficiently approximated using reduced-order models, such as deep Koopman operators, that allow for rapid generation of long prior sequences while maintaining stability over extended forecasting horizon. With this gain, we can reframe forecasting as trajectory planning, a common task in reinforcement learning, where conditional denoising is performed once over entire sequences, minimizing the computational cost of autoregressive-based generative methods. Empirical evaluations on chaotic systems of increasing complexity, including Kolmogorov flow, shallow water equations, and subseasonal-to-seasonal climate dynamics, demonstrate Cohesion superior long-range forecasting skill that can efficiently generate physically-consistent simulations, even in the presence of partially-observed guidance.</p></details> | 41 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Cross-attention for State-based model RWKV-7](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14260v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce CrossWKV, a novel cross-attention mechanism for the state-based RWKV-7 model, designed to enhance the expressive power of text-to-image generation. Leveraging RWKV-7's linear-complexity Weighted Key-Value (WKV) architecture, CrossWKV integrates text and image modalities in a single pass, utilizing a generalized delta rule with vector-valued gating and low-rank adaptations (LoRA) to achieve superior cross-modal alignment. Unlike Transformer-based models, CrossWKV's non-diagonal, input-dependent transition matrix enables it to represent complex functions beyond the $\mathrm{TC}^0$ complexity class, including all regular languages, as demonstrated by its ability to perform state-tracking tasks like $S_5$ permutation modeling. Evaluated within the Diffusion in RWKV-7 (DIR-7) on datasets such as LAION-5B and ImageNet, CrossWKV achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 2.88 and a CLIP score of 0.33 on ImageNet 256x256, matching state-of-the-art performance while offering robust generalization across diverse prompts. The model's enhanced expressivity, combined with constant memory usage and linear scaling, positions it as a powerful solution for advanced cross-modal tasks, with potential applications in high-resolution generation and dynamic state manipulation.Code at https://github.com/TorchRWKV/flash-linear-attention</p></details> |  |
| **[HoLa: B-Rep Generation using a Holistic Latent Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14257v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel representation for learning and generating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models in the form of $\textit{boundary representations}$ (B-Reps). Our representation unifies the continuous geometric properties of B-Rep primitives in different orders (e.g., surfaces and curves) and their discrete topological relations in a $\textit{holistic latent}$ (HoLa) space. This is based on the simple observation that the topological connection between two surfaces is intrinsically tied to the geometry of their intersecting curve. Such a prior allows us to reformulate topology learning in B-Reps as a geometric reconstruction problem in Euclidean space. Specifically, we eliminate the presence of curves, vertices, and all the topological connections in the latent space by learning to distinguish and derive curve geometries from a pair of surface primitives via a neural intersection network. To this end, our holistic latent space is only defined on surfaces but encodes a full B-Rep model, including the geometry of surfaces, curves, vertices, and their topological relations. Our compact and holistic latent space facilitates the design of a first diffusion-based generator to take on a large variety of inputs including point clouds, single/multi-view images, 2D sketches, and text prompts. Our method significantly reduces ambiguities, redundancies, and incoherences among the generated B-Rep primitives, as well as training complexities inherent in prior multi-step B-Rep learning pipelines, while achieving greatly improved validity rate over current state of the art: 82% vs. $\approx$50%.</p></details> |  |

Although recent deep learning methods show promise in highlight removal, they remain suboptimal for document images, primarily due to the lack of dedicated datasets and tailored architectural designs. To tackle these challenges, we present DocHR14K, a large-scale real-world dataset comprising 14,902 high-resolution image pairs across six document categories and various lighting conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first high-resolution dataset for document highlight removal that captures a wide range of real-world lighting conditions. Additionally, motivated by the observation that the residual map between highlighted and clean images naturally reveals the spatial structure of highlight regions, we propose a simple yet effective Highlight Location Prior (HLP) to estimate highlight masks without human annotations. Building on this prior, we present the Location-Aware Laplacian Pyramid Highlight Removal Network (L2HRNet), which effectively removes highlights by leveraging estimated priors and incorporates diffusion module to restore details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DocHR14K improves highlight removal under diverse lighting conditions. Our L2HRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, including a 5.01\% increase in PSNR and a 13.17\% reduction in RMSE on DocHR14K.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main paper with 8 pages, conference</p></details> |

Starting from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, PRISM proposes an effective fine-tuning strategy to produce RGB images along with intrinsic maps (referred to as X layers) simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, which infer intrinsic properties individually or require separate models for decomposition and conditional generation, PRISM maintains consistency across modalities by generating all intrinsic layers jointly. It supports diverse tasks, including text-to-RGBX generation, RGB-to-X decomposition, and X-to-RGBX conditional generation. Additionally, PRISM enables both global and local image editing through conditioning on selected intrinsic layers and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of PRISM both for intrinsic image decomposition and conditional image generation while preserving the base model's text-to-image generation capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Joint ID-Textual Representation for ID-Preserving Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14202v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for ID-preserving generation using a multi-modal encoding strategy rather than injecting identity features via adapters into pre-trained models. Our method treats identity and text as a unified conditioning input. To achieve this, we introduce FaceCLIP, a multi-modal encoder that learns a joint embedding space for both identity and textual semantics. Given a reference face and a text prompt, FaceCLIP produces a unified representation that encodes both identity and text, which conditions a base diffusion model to generate images that are identity-consistent and text-aligned. We also present a multi-modal alignment algorithm to train FaceCLIP, using a loss that aligns its joint representation with face, text, and image embedding spaces. We then build FaceCLIP-SDXL, an ID-preserving image synthesis pipeline by integrating FaceCLIP with Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL). Compared to prior methods, FaceCLIP-SDXL enables photorealistic portrait generation with better identity preservation and textual relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate its quantitative and qualitative superiority.</p></details> |  |

However, their ability to detect subtle visual spoofing and forgery clues in face attack detection tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark, SHIELD, to evaluate MLLMs for face spoofing and forgery detection. Specifically, we design true/false and multiple-choice questions to assess MLLM performance on multimodal face data across two tasks. For the face anti-spoofing task, we evaluate three modalities (i.e., RGB, infrared, and depth) under six attack types. For the face forgery detection task, we evaluate GAN-based and diffusion-based data, incorporating visual and acoustic modalities. We conduct zero-shot and few-shot evaluations in standard and chain of thought (COT) settings. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-attribute chain of thought (MA-COT) paradigm for describing and judging various task-specific and task-irrelevant attributes of face images. The findings of this study demonstrate that MLLMs exhibit strong potential for addressing the challenges associated with the security of facial recognition technology applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Visual Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Multi-agent Auto-Bidding with Latent Graph Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05805v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a diffusion-based auto-bidding framework that leverages graph representations to model large-scale auction environments. In such settings, agents must dynamically optimize bidding strategies under constraints defined by key performance indicator (KPI) metrics, all while operating in competitive environments characterized by uncertain, sparse, and stochastic variables. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach combining learnable graph-based embeddings with a planning-based latent diffusion model (LDM). By capturing patterns and nuances underlying the interdependence of impression opportunities and the multi-agent dynamics of the auction environment, the graph representation enable expressive computations regarding auto-bidding outcomes. With reward alignment techniques, the LDM's posterior is fine-tuned to generate auto-bidding trajectories that maximize KPI metrics while satisfying constraint thresholds. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and synthetic auction environments demonstrate significant improvements in auto-bidding performance across multiple common KPI metrics, as well as accuracy in forecasting auction outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Learning of Densities on Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03963v2)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A generative modeling framework is proposed that combines diffusion models and manifold learning to efficiently sample data densities on manifolds. The approach utilizes Diffusion Maps to uncover possible low-dimensional underlying (latent) spaces in the high-dimensional data (ambient) space. Two approaches for sampling from the latent data density are described. The first is a score-based diffusion model, which is trained to map a standard normal distribution to the latent data distribution using a neural network. The second one involves solving an It\^o stochastic differential equation in the latent space. Additional realizations of the data are generated by lifting the samples back to the ambient space using Double Diffusion Maps, a recently introduced technique typically employed in studying dynamical system reduction; here the focus lies in sampling densities rather than system dynamics. The proposed approaches enable sampling high dimensional data densities restricted to low-dimensional, a priori unknown manifolds. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a benchmark problem and a material with multiscale structure.</p></details> |  |

Existing generative approaches for multi-target attacks mainly analyze the effect of the use of target labels on noise generation from a theoretical perspective, lacking practical validation and comprehensive summarization. To address this gap, we first identify and validate that the semantic feature quality and quantity are critical factors affecting the transferability of targeted attacks: 1) Feature quality refers to the structural and detailed completeness of the implanted target features, as deficiencies may result in the loss of key discriminative information; 2) Feature quantity refers to the spatial sufficiency of the implanted target features, as inadequacy limits the victim model's attention to this feature. Based on these findings, we propose the 2D Tensor-Guided Adversarial Fusion (2D-TGAF) framework, which leverages the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models to encode target labels into two-dimensional semantic tensors for guiding adversarial noise generation. Additionally, we design a novel masking strategy tailored for the training process, ensuring that parts of the generated noise retain complete semantic information about the target class. Extensive experiments on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that 2D-TGAF consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods in attack success rates, both on normally trained models and across various defense mechanisms.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

While diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in text-guided image synthesis, they often lack controllability and fail to preserve layout consistency under non-trivial manipulations such as rotation, translation, scaling, and warping. To address these limitations, DanceText introduces a layered editing strategy that separates text from the background, allowing geometric transformations to be performed in a modular and controllable manner. A depth-aware module is further proposed to align appearance and perspective between the transformed text and the reconstructed background, enhancing photorealism and spatial consistency. Importantly, DanceText adopts a fully training-free design by integrating pretrained modules, allowing flexible deployment without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on the AnyWord-3M benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in visual quality, especially under large-scale and complex transformation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[ID-Booth: Identity-consistent Face Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07392v3)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data that is applicable in a variety of domains, including face recognition. Here, state-of-the-art generative models typically rely on conditioning and fine-tuning of powerful pretrained diffusion models to facilitate the synthesis of realistic images of a desired identity. Yet, these models often do not consider the identity of subjects during training, leading to poor consistency between generated and intended identities. In contrast, methods that employ identity-based training objectives tend to overfit on various aspects of the identity, and in turn, lower the diversity of images that can be generated. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel generative diffusion-based framework, called ID-Booth. ID-Booth consists of a denoising network responsible for data generation, a variational auto-encoder for mapping images to and from a lower-dimensional latent space and a text encoder that allows for prompt-based control over the generation procedure. The framework utilizes a novel triplet identity training objective and enables identity-consistent image generation while retaining the synthesis capabilities of pretrained diffusion models. Experiments with a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model and diverse prompts reveal that our method facilitates better intra-identity consistency and inter-identity separability than competing methods, while achieving higher image diversity. In turn, the produced data allows for effective augmentation of small-scale datasets and training of better-performing recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner. The source code for the ID-Booth framework is publicly available at https://github.com/dariant/ID-Booth.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG) 2025, 14 pages</p></details> |

In this paper, a mathematical expression for the frequency-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm is derived, which quantifies the error within the desired frequency interval. Subsequently, the necessary conditions for a local optimum of the frequency-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the error are derived. The inherent difficulty in satisfying these conditions within a Petrov-Galerkin projection framework is also discussed. Using the optimality conditions and the Petrov-Galerkin projection, a stationary point iteration algorithm is proposed, which approximately satisfies these optimality conditions upon convergence. The main computational effort in the proposed algorithm involves solving sparse-dense Sylvester equations. These equations are frequently encountered in $\mathcal{H}_2$ model order reduction algorithms and can be solved efficiently. Moreover, the algorithm bypasses the requirement of matrix logarithm computation, which is typically necessary for most frequency-limited reduction methods and can be computationally demanding for high-order systems. An illustrative example is provided to numerically validate the developed theory. The proposed algorithm's effectiveness in accurately approximating the original high-order model within the specified frequency range is demonstrated through the reduction of an advection-diffusion equation-based model, commonly used in model reduction literature for testing algorithms. Additionally, the algorithm's computational efficiency is highlighted by successfully reducing a flexible space structure model of order one million.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Stochastic Closure Modeling via Conditional Diffusion Model and Neural Operator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02965v3)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Closure models are widely used in simulating complex multiscale dynamical systems such as turbulence and the earth system, for which direct numerical simulation that resolves all scales is often too expensive. For those systems without a clear scale separation, deterministic and local closure models often lack enough generalization capability, which limits their performance in many real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling framework for constructing stochastic and non-local closure models via conditional diffusion model and neural operator. Specifically, the Fourier neural operator is incorporated into a score-based diffusion model, which serves as a data-driven stochastic closure model for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We also demonstrate how accelerated sampling methods can improve the efficiency of the data-driven stochastic closure model. The results show that the proposed methodology provides a systematic approach via generative machine learning techniques to construct data-driven stochastic closure models for multiscale dynamical systems with continuous spatiotemporal fields.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fashion-RAG: Multimodal Fashion Image Editing via Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14011v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the fashion industry has increasingly adopted AI technologies to enhance customer experience, driven by the proliferation of e-commerce platforms and virtual applications. Among the various tasks, virtual try-on and multimodal fashion image editing -- which utilizes diverse input modalities such as text, garment sketches, and body poses -- have become a key area of research. Diffusion models have emerged as a leading approach for such generative tasks, offering superior image quality and diversity. However, most existing virtual try-on methods rely on having a specific garment input, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios where users may only provide textual specifications. To address this limitation, in this work we introduce Fashion Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Fashion-RAG), a novel method that enables the customization of fashion items based on user preferences provided in textual form. Our approach retrieves multiple garments that match the input specifications and generates a personalized image by incorporating attributes from the retrieved items. To achieve this, we employ textual inversion techniques, where retrieved garment images are projected into the textual embedding space of the Stable Diffusion text encoder, allowing seamless integration of retrieved elements into the generative process. Experimental results on the Dress Code dataset demonstrate that Fashion-RAG outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, effectively capturing fine-grained visual details from retrieved garments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a retrieval-augmented generation approach specifically tailored for multimodal fashion image editing.</p></details> | IJCNN 2025 |
| **[High-Resolution Frame Interpolation with Patch-based Cascaded Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11838v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent progress, existing frame interpolation methods still struggle with processing extremely high resolution input and handling challenging cases such as repetitive textures, thin objects, and large motion. To address these issues, we introduce a patch-based cascaded pixel diffusion model for high resolution frame interpolation, HIFI, that excels in these scenarios while achieving competitive performance on standard benchmarks. Cascades, which generate a series of images from low to high resolution, can help significantly with large or complex motion that require both global context for a coarse solution and detailed context for high resolution output. However, contrary to prior work on cascaded diffusion models which perform diffusion on increasingly large resolutions, we use a single model that always performs diffusion at the same resolution and upsamples by processing patches of the inputs and the prior solution. At inference time, this drastically reduces memory usage and allows a single model, solving both frame interpolation (base model's task) and spatial up-sampling, saving training cost as well. HIFI excels at high-resolution images and complex repeated textures that require global context, achieving comparable or state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks (Vimeo, Xiph, X-Test, and SEPE-8K). We further introduce a new dataset, LaMoR, that focuses on particularly challenging cases, and HIFI significantly outperforms other baselines.

Although applying Logit Lens to Vision Transformers (ViTs) is technically straightforward, its direct use faces limitations in capturing the richness of visual representations. Building on the work of Toker et al. (2024)~\cite{Toker2024-ve}, who introduced Diffusion Lens to visualize intermediate representations in the text encoders of text-to-image diffusion models, we demonstrate that while Diffusion Lens can effectively visualize residual stream representations in image encoders, it fails to capture the direct contributions of individual submodules. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{Diffusion Steering Lens} (DSL), a novel, training-free approach that steers submodule outputs and patches subsequent indirect contributions. We validate our method through interventional studies, showing that DSL provides an intuitive and reliable interpretation of the internal processing in ViTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 17 figures.

It is the first on-policy approach that allows significantly more gradient updates than the number of energy evaluations and model samples, allowing us to scale to much larger problem settings than previously explored by similar methods. Our framework is theoretically grounded in stochastic optimal control and shares the same theoretical guarantees as Adjoint Matching, being able to train without the need for corrective measures that push samples towards the target distribution. We show how to incorporate key symmetries, as well as periodic boundary conditions, for modeling molecules in both cartesian and torsional coordinates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on classical energy functions, and further scale up to neural network-based energy models where we perform amortized conformer generation across many molecular systems. To encourage further research in developing highly scalable sampling methods, we plan to open source these challenging benchmarks, where successful methods can directly impact progress in computational chemistry.</p></details> |  |

By initializing from multimodal Generative PreTraining (mGPT), we demonstrate that decoder-only Autoregressive (AR) model can achieve image generation performance comparable to modern diffusion models with high efficiency through Flexible Progressive Supervised Fine-tuning (FP-SFT). Equipped with our proposed Unambiguous image Representation (UniRep), Lumina-mGPT can flexibly generate high-quality images of varying aspect ratios. Building on the strong image generation capabilities, we further explore Ominiponent Supervised Fine-tuning (Omni-SFT), an initial attempt to elevate Lumina-mGPT into a unified multi-modal generalist. The resulting model demonstrates versatile multimodal capabilities, including visual generation tasks like text-to-image/multiview generation and controllable generation, visual recognition tasks like segmentation and depth estimation, and vision-language tasks like multi-turn visual question answering, showing the rosy potential of the technical direction.

However, they still struggle to properly render the spatial relationships described in text prompts. To address the lack of spatial information in T2I generations, existing methods typically use external network conditioning and predefined layouts, resulting in higher computational costs and reduced flexibility. Our approach builds upon a curated dataset of spatially explicit prompts, meticulously extracted and synthesized from LAION-400M to ensure precise alignment between textual descriptions and spatial layouts. Alongside this dataset, we present ESPLoRA, a flexible fine-tuning framework based on Low-Rank Adaptation, specifically designed to enhance spatial consistency in generative models without increasing generation time or compromising the quality of the outputs. In addition to ESPLoRA, we propose refined evaluation metrics grounded in geometric constraints, capturing 3D spatial relations such as \textit{in front of} or \textit{behind}. These metrics also expose spatial biases in T2I models which, even when not fully mitigated, can be strategically exploited by our TORE algorithm to further improve the spatial consistency of generated images. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art framework, CoMPaSS, by 13.33% on established spatial consistency benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Compared to existing methods, there are two key designs to ensure high-quality and accurate part-aware generation. On one hand, we introduce a latent 3D diffusion process for neural voxel fields, enabling generation at significantly higher resolutions that can accurately capture rich textural and geometric details. On the other hand, a part-aware shape decoder is introduced to integrate the part codes into the neural voxel fields, guiding the accurate part decomposition and producing high-quality rendering results. Through extensive experimentation and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we evaluate our approach across four different classes of data. The results demonstrate the superior generative capabilities of our proposed method in part-aware shape generation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by TVCG</p></details> |

However, generating time series of tabular data, where each element of the series depends on the others, remains a largely unexplored domain. This gap is probably due to the difficulty of jointly solving different problems, the main of which are the heterogeneity of tabular data (a problem common to non-time-dependent approaches) and the variable length of a time series. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) based approach for tabular data series generation. Inspired by the recent success of DiTs in image and video generation, we extend this framework to deal with heterogeneous data and variable-length sequences. Using extensive experiments on six datasets, we show that the proposed approach outperforms previous work by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025. 26 pages, 19 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

However, these approaches often overlook the critical role of user characteristics, which are essential in real-world scenarios like conversational search and recommendation, where interactions must adapt to individual user traits such as personality, preferences, and goals. To address this gap, we first conduct a comprehensive study utilizing task-specific user personas to systematically assess dialogue policy planning under diverse user behaviors. By leveraging realistic user profiles for different tasks, our study reveals significant limitations in existing approaches, highlighting the need for user-tailored dialogue policy planning. Building on this foundation, we present the User-Tailored Dialogue Policy Planning (UDP) framework, which incorporates an Intrinsic User World Model to model user traits and feedback. UDP operates in three stages: (1) User Persona Portraying, using a diffusion model to dynamically infer user profiles; (2) User Feedback Anticipating, leveraging a Brownian Bridge-inspired anticipator to predict user reactions; and (3) User-Tailored Policy Planning, integrating these insights to optimize response strategies. To ensure robust performance, we further propose an active learning approach that prioritizes challenging user personas during training. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks, including collaborative and non-collaborative settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of UDP in learning user-specific dialogue strategies. Results validate the protocol's utility and highlight UDP's robustness, adaptability, and potential to advance user-centric dialogue systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Yet, efficiently editing these representations while retaining photorealism is an emerging challenge. Recent methods face three primary limitations: they're slow for interactive use, lack precision at object boundaries, and struggle to ensure multi-view consistency. We introduce IReNe to address these limitations, enabling swift, near real-time color editing in NeRF. Leveraging a pre-trained NeRF model and a single training image with user-applied color edits, IReNe swiftly adjusts network parameters in seconds. This adjustment allows the model to generate new scene views, accurately representing the color changes from the training image while also controlling object boundaries and view-specific effects. Object boundary control is achieved by integrating a trainable segmentation module into the model. The process gains efficiency by retraining only the weights of the last network layer. We observed that neurons in this layer can be classified into those responsible for view-dependent appearance and those contributing to diffuse appearance. We introduce an automated classification approach to identify these neuron types and exclusively fine-tune the weights of the diffuse neurons. This further accelerates training and ensures consistent color edits across different views. A thorough validation on a new dataset, with edited object colors, shows significant quantitative and qualitative advancements over competitors, accelerating speeds by 5x to 500x.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging latent space representations and reducing the number of diffusion steps, SupResDiffGAN achieves significantly faster inference times than other diffusion-based super-resolution models while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. To prevent discriminator overfitting, we propose adaptive noise corruption, ensuring a stable balance between the generator and the discriminator during training. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms traditional diffusion models such as SR3 and I$^2$SB in efficiency and image quality. This work bridges the performance gap between diffusion- and GAN-based methods, laying the foundation for real-time applications of diffusion models in high-resolution image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>25th ...</summary><p>25th International Conference on Computational Science</p></details> |
| **[Entropic Time Schedulers for Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13612v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Entropy Rectifying Guidance for Diffusion and Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13987v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guidance techniques are commonly used in diffusion and flow models to improve image quality and consistency for conditional generative tasks such as class-conditional and text-to-image generation. In particular, classifier-free guidance (CFG) -- the most widely adopted guidance technique -- contrasts conditional and unconditional predictions to improve the generated images. This results, however, in trade-offs across quality, diversity and consistency, improving some at the expense of others. While recent work has shown that it is possible to disentangle these factors to some extent, such methods come with an overhead of requiring an additional (weaker) model, or require more forward passes per sampling step. In this paper, we propose Entropy Rectifying Guidance (ERG), a simple and effective guidance mechanism based on inference-time changes in the attention mechanism of state-of-the-art diffusion transformer architectures, which allows for simultaneous improvements over image quality, diversity and prompt consistency. ERG is more general than CFG and similar guidance techniques, as it extends to unconditional sampling. ERG results in significant improvements in various generation tasks such as text-to-image, class-conditional and unconditional image generation. We also show that ERG can be seamlessly combined with other recent guidance methods such as CADS and APG, further boosting generation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[WeatherGen: A Unified Diverse Weather Generator for LiDAR Point Clouds via Spider Mamba Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13561v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene perception demands a large amount of adverse-weather LiDAR data, yet the cost of LiDAR data collection presents a significant scaling-up challenge. To this end, a series of LiDAR simulators have been proposed. Yet, they can only simulate a single adverse weather with a single physical model, and the fidelity of the generated data is quite limited. This paper presents WeatherGen, the first unified diverse-weather LiDAR data diffusion generation framework, significantly improving fidelity. Specifically, we first design a map-based data producer, which can provide a vast amount of high-quality diverse-weather data for training purposes. Then, we utilize the diffusion-denoising paradigm to construct a diffusion model. Among them, we propose a spider mamba generator to restore the disturbed diverse weather data gradually. The spider mamba models the feature interactions by scanning the LiDAR beam circle or central ray, excellently maintaining the physical structure of the LiDAR data. Subsequently, following the generator to transfer real-world knowledge, we design a latent feature aligner. Afterward, we devise a contrastive learning-based controller, which equips weather control signals with compact semantic knowledge through language supervision, guiding the diffusion model to generate more discriminative data. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the high generation quality of WeatherGen. Through WeatherGen, we construct the mini-weather dataset, promoting the performance of the downstream task under adverse weather conditions.

| **[Task Assignment and Exploration Optimization for Low Altitude UAV Rescue via Generative AI Enhanced Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13554v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven convolutional neural networks enhance rescue, inspection, and surveillance tasks performed by low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground computing nodes (GCNs) in unknown environments. However, their high computational demands often exceed a single UAV's capacity, leading to system instability, further exacerbated by the limited and dynamic resources of GCNs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel cooperation framework involving UAVs, ground-embedded robots (GERs), and high-altitude platforms (HAPs), which enable resource pooling through UAV-to-GER (U2G) and UAV-to-HAP (U2H) communications to provide computing services for UAV offloaded tasks. Specifically, we formulate the multi-objective optimization problem of task assignment and exploration optimization in UAVs as a dynamic long-term optimization problem. Our objective is to minimize task completion time and energy consumption while ensuring system stability over time. To achieve this, we first employ the Lyapunov optimization technique to transform the original problem, with stability constraints, into a per-slot deterministic problem. We then propose an algorithm named HG-MADDPG, which combines the Hungarian algorithm with a generative diffusion model (GDM)-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach. We first introduce the Hungarian algorithm as a method for exploration area selection, enhancing UAV efficiency in interacting with the environment. We then innovatively integrate the GDM and multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to optimize task assignment decisions, such as task offloading and resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant improvements in task offloading efficiency, latency reduction, and system stability compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Prior approaches have difficulties in recovering fine-grained details and true colors of the scene under extremely low-light environments due to near-to-zero SNR. Meanwhile, diffusion models have shown significant progress towards general domain image generation. In this paper, we propose to leverage the pre-trained latent diffusion model to perform the neural ISP for enhancing extremely low-light images. Specifically, to tailor the pre-trained latent diffusion model to operate on the RAW domain, we train a set of lightweight taming modules to inject the RAW information into the diffusion denoising process via modulating the intermediate features of UNet. We further observe different roles of UNet denoising and decoder reconstruction in the latent diffusion model, which inspires us to decompose the low-light image enhancement task into latent-space low-frequency content generation and decoding-phase high-frequency detail maintenance. Through extensive experiments on representative datasets, we demonstrate our simple design not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantitative evaluations but also shows significant superiority in visual comparisons over strong baselines, which highlight the effectiveness of powerful generative priors for neural ISP under extremely low-light environments.

| **[Beyond One-Hot Labels: Semantic Mixing for Model Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13548v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model calibration seeks to ensure that models produce confidence scores that accurately reflect the true likelihood of their predictions being correct. However, existing calibration approaches are fundamentally tied to datasets of one-hot labels implicitly assuming full certainty in all the annotations. Such datasets are effective for classification but provides insufficient knowledge of uncertainty for model calibration, necessitating the curation of datasets with numerically rich ground-truth confidence values. However, due to the scarcity of uncertain visual examples, such samples are not easily available as real datasets. In this paper, we introduce calibration-aware data augmentation to create synthetic datasets of diverse samples and their ground-truth uncertainty. Specifically, we present Calibration-aware Semantic Mixing (CSM), a novel framework that generates training samples with mixed class characteristics and annotates them with distinct confidence scores via diffusion models. Based on this framework, we propose calibrated reannotation to tackle the misalignment between the annotated confidence score and the mixing ratio during the diffusion reverse process. Besides, we explore the loss functions that better fit the new data representation paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that CSM achieves superior calibration compared to the state-of-the-art calibration approaches. Code is available at github.com/E-Galois/CSM.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, we propose U-Shape Mamba (USM), a novel diffusion model that leverages Mamba-based layers within a U-Net-like hierarchical structure. By progressively reducing sequence length in the encoder and restoring it in the decoder through Mamba blocks, USM significantly lowers computational overhead while maintaining strong generative capabilities. Experimental results against Zigma, which is currently the most efficient Mamba-based diffusion model, demonstrate that USM achieves one-third the GFlops, requires less memory and is faster, while outperforming Zigma in image quality. Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is improved by 15.3, 0.84 and 2.7 points on AFHQ, CelebAHQ and COCO datasets, respectively. These findings highlight USM as a highly efficient and scalable solution for diffusion-based generative models, making high-quality image synthesis more accessible to the research community while reducing computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepeted at CVPR 2025 eLVM workshop</p></details> |

Instruction-guided image editing with diffusion models offers user-friendly capabilities, yet editing failures, such as background distortion, frequently occur. Users often resort to trial and error, adjusting seeds or prompts to achieve satisfactory results, which is inefficient. While seed selection methods exist for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, they depend on external verifiers, limiting applicability, and evaluating multiple seeds increases computational complexity. To address this, we first establish a multiple-seed-based image editing baseline using background consistency scores, achieving Best-of-N performance without supervision. Building on this, we introduce ELECT (Early-timestep Latent Evaluation for Candidate Selection), a zero-shot framework that selects reliable seeds by estimating background mismatches at early diffusion timesteps, identifying the seed that retains the background while modifying only the foreground. ELECT ranks seed candidates by a background inconsistency score, filtering unsuitable samples early based on background consistency while preserving editability. Beyond standalone seed selection, ELECT integrates into instruction-guided editing pipelines and extends to Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) for joint seed and prompt selection, further improving results when seed selection alone is insufficient. Experiments show that ELECT reduces computational costs (by 41 percent on average and up to 61 percent) while improving background consistency and instruction adherence, achieving around 40 percent success rates in previously failed cases - without any external supervision or training.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaMD: Latent Motion Diffusion for Image-Conditional Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11603v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The video generation field has witnessed rapid improvements with the introduction of recent diffusion models. While these models have successfully enhanced appearance quality, they still face challenges in generating coherent and natural movements while efficiently sampling videos. In this paper, we propose to condense video generation into a problem of motion generation, to improve the expressiveness of motion and make video generation more manageable. This can be achieved by breaking down the video generation process into latent motion generation and video reconstruction. Specifically, we present a latent motion diffusion (LaMD) framework, which consists of a motion-decomposed video autoencoder and a diffusion-based motion generator, to implement this idea. Through careful design, the motion-decomposed video autoencoder can compress patterns in movement into a concise latent motion representation. Consequently, the diffusion-based motion generator is able to efficiently generate realistic motion on a continuous latent space under multi-modal conditions, at a cost that is similar to that of image diffusion models. Results show that LaMD generates high-quality videos on various benchmark datasets, including BAIR, Landscape, NATOPS, MUG and CATER-GEN, that encompass a variety of stochastic dynamics and highly controllable movements on multiple image-conditional video generation tasks, while significantly decreases sampling time.</p></details> | accepted by IJCV |

Such models are often obtained in some asymptotic limits, for instance a diffusion or a fluid limit, and as a consequence the original Liouville equation contains small parameters. A standard method such as a split-step algorithm is then accurate provided the time step is sufficiently small compared to the asymptotic parameter, which is a severe limitation. In the case of the diffusion limit, we propose a numerical method that is accurate for time steps independent of the small parameter, and which captures well both the microscopic dynamics and the diffusion limit. Our approach is substantiated by an informal theoretical error analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[PT-Mark: Invisible Watermarking for Text-to-image Diffusion Models via Semantic-aware Pivotal Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10853v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking for diffusion images has drawn considerable attention due to the widespread use of text-to-image diffusion models and the increasing need for their copyright protection. Recently, advanced watermarking techniques, such as Tree Ring, integrate watermarks by embedding traceable patterns (e.g., Rings) into the latent distribution during the diffusion process. Such methods disrupt the original semantics of the generated images due to the inevitable distribution shift caused by the watermarks, thereby limiting their practicality, particularly in digital art creation. In this work, we present Semantic-aware Pivotal Tuning Watermarks (PT-Mark), a novel invisible watermarking method that preserves both the semantics of diffusion images and the traceability of the watermark. PT-Mark preserves the original semantics of the watermarked image by gradually aligning the generation trajectory with the original (pivotal) trajectory while maintaining the traceable watermarks during whole diffusion denoising process. To achieve this, we first compute the salient regions of the watermark at each diffusion denoising step as a spatial prior to identify areas that can be aligned without disrupting the watermark pattern. Guided by the region, we then introduce an additional pivotal tuning branch that optimizes the text embedding to align the semantics while preserving the watermarks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PT-Mark can preserve the original semantics of the diffusion images while integrating robust watermarks. It achieves a 10% improvement in the performance of semantic preservation (i.e., SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS) compared to state-of-the-art watermarking methods, while also showing comparable robustness against real-world perturbations and four times greater efficiency.</p></details> |  |

PTDiffusion harmoniously embeds an input reference image into arbitrary scenes described by the text prompts, producing illusion images exhibiting hidden visual cues of the reference image. At the heart of our method is a plug-and-play phase transfer mechanism that dynamically and progressively transplants diffusion features' phase spectrum from the denoising process to reconstruct the reference image into the one to sample the generated illusion image, realizing deep fusion of the reference structural information and the textual semantic information in the diffusion model latent space. Furthermore, we propose asynchronous phase transfer to enable flexible control to the degree of hidden content discernability. Our method bypasses any model training and fine-tuning process, all while substantially outperforming related text-guided I2I methods in image generation quality, text fidelity, visual discernibility, and contextual naturalness for illusion picture synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments.

| **[WaterFlow: Learning Fast & Robust Watermarks using Stable Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12354v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to embed watermarks in images is a fundamental problem of interest for computer vision, and is exacerbated by the rapid rise of generated imagery in recent times. Current state-of-the-art techniques suffer from computational and statistical challenges such as the slow execution speed for practical deployments. In addition, other works trade off fast watermarking speeds but suffer greatly in their robustness or perceptual quality. In this work, we propose WaterFlow (WF), a fast and extremely robust approach for high fidelity visual watermarking based on a learned latent-dependent watermark. Our approach utilizes a pretrained latent diffusion model to encode an arbitrary image into a latent space and produces a learned watermark that is then planted into the Fourier Domain of the latent. The transformation is specified via invertible flow layers that enhance the expressivity of the latent space of the pre-trained model to better preserve image quality while permitting robust and tractable detection. Most notably, WaterFlow demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on general robustness and is the first method capable of effectively defending against difficult combination attacks. We validate our findings on three widely used real and generated datasets: MS-COCO, DiffusionDB, and WikiArt.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervising 3D Talking Head Avatars with Analysis-by-Audio-Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13386v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to be widely applicable, speech-driven 3D head avatars must articulate their lips in accordance with speech, while also conveying the appropriate emotions with dynamically changing facial expressions. The key problem is that deterministic models produce high-quality lip-sync but without rich expressions, whereas stochastic models generate diverse expressions but with lower lip-sync quality. To get the best of both, we seek a stochastic model with accurate lip-sync. To that end, we develop a new approach based on the following observation: if a method generates realistic 3D lip motions, it should be possible to infer the spoken audio from the lip motion. The inferred speech should match the original input audio, and erroneous predictions create a novel supervision signal for training 3D talking head avatars with accurate lip-sync. To demonstrate this effect, we propose THUNDER (Talking Heads Under Neural Differentiable Elocution Reconstruction), a 3D talking head avatar framework that introduces a novel supervision mechanism via differentiable sound production. First, we train a novel mesh-to-speech model that regresses audio from facial animation. Then, we incorporate this model into a diffusion-based talking avatar framework. During training, the mesh-to-speech model takes the generated animation and produces a sound that is compared to the input speech, creating a differentiable analysis-by-audio-synthesis supervision loop. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that THUNDER significantly improves the quality of the lip-sync of talking head avatars while still allowing for generation of diverse, high-quality, expressive facial animations.</p></details> |  |

Our method proposes using HDR Gaussian Splats as light source representation, marking the first time regular images can serve as light sources in a 3D renderer. Our two-stage process first enhances the dynamic range of images plausibly and accurately by leveraging the priors embedded in diffusion models. Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources. We assess our method using a combination of this novel dataset and an existing dataset from the literature. Project page: https://lvsn.github.io/gaslight/</p></details> |  |
| **[SMPL-GPTexture: Dual-View 3D Human Texture Estimation using Text-to-Image Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13378v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-quality, photorealistic textures for 3D human avatars remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision and multimedia field. However, real paired front and back images of human subjects are rarely available with privacy, ethical and cost of acquisition, which restricts scalability of the data. Additionally, learning priors from image inputs using deep generative models, such as GANs or diffusion models, to infer unseen regions such as the human back often leads to artifacts, structural inconsistencies, or loss of fine-grained detail. To address these issues, we present SMPL-GPTexture (skinned multi-person linear model - general purpose Texture), a novel pipeline that takes natural language prompts as input and leverages a state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model to produce paired high-resolution front and back images of a human subject as the starting point for texture estimation. Using the generated paired dual-view images, we first employ a human mesh recovery model to obtain a robust 2D-to-3D SMPL alignment between image pixels and the 3D model's UV coordinates for each views. Second, we use an inverted rasterization technique that explicitly projects the observed colour from the input images into the UV space, thereby producing accurate, complete texture maps. Finally, we apply a diffusion-based inpainting module to fill in the missing regions, and the fusion mechanism then combines these results into a unified full texture map. Extensive experiments shows that our SMPL-GPTexture can generate high resolution texture aligned with user's prompts.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce VideoPanda, a novel approach for synthesizing 360$^\circ$ videos conditioned on text or single-view video data. VideoPanda leverages multi-view attention layers to augment a video diffusion model, enabling it to generate consistent multi-view videos that can be combined into immersive panoramic content. VideoPanda is trained jointly using two conditions: text-only and single-view video, and supports autoregressive generation of long-videos. To overcome the computational burden of multi-view video generation, we randomly subsample the duration and camera views used during training and show that the model is able to gracefully generalize to generating more frames during inference. Extensive evaluations on both real-world and synthetic video datasets demonstrate that VideoPanda generates more realistic and coherent 360$^\circ$ panoramas across all input conditions compared to existing methods.

Mesh hierarchies are formed via domain decomposition techniques, and the method is applicable to fully unstructured meshes using arbitrary element shapes. Furthermore, the method can be employed for a wide range of commonly used DG numerical fluxes for first- and second-order PDEs including the Interior Penalty and the Local Discontinuous Galerkin methods.

| **[On the minimax optimality of Flow Matching through the connection to kernel density estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13336v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow Matching has recently gained attention in generative modeling as a simple and flexible alternative to diffusion models, the current state of the art. While existing statistical guarantees adapt tools from the analysis of diffusion models, we take a different perspective by connecting Flow Matching to kernel density estimation. We first verify that the kernel density estimator matches the optimal rate of convergence in Wasserstein distance up to logarithmic factors, improving existing bounds for the Gaussian kernel. Based on this result, we prove that for sufficiently large networks, Flow Matching also achieves the optimal rate up to logarithmic factors, providing a theoretical foundation for the empirical success of this method. Finally, we provide a first justification of Flow Matching's effectiveness in high-dimensional settings by showing that rates improve when the target distribution lies on a lower-dimensional linear subspace.</p></details> |  |

These continuous-time stochastic processes with a user-specified limiting distribution are designed for sampling in settings involving discrete parameters and/or non-smooth distributions, addressing limitations of other processes such as the overdamped Langevin diffusion. The paper establishes the well-posedness, non-explosivity, and ergodicity of LBMJPs under mild conditions. We further explore regularity properties such as the Feller property and characterise the weak generator of the process. We then derive conditions for exponential ergodicity via spectral gaps and establish comparison theorems for different balancing functions. In particular we show an equivalence between the spectral gaps of Metropolis--Hastings algorithms and LBMJPs with bounded balancing function, but show that LBMJPs can exhibit uniform ergodicity on unbounded state spaces when the balancing function is unbounded, even when the limiting distribution is not sub-Gaussian. We also establish a diffusion limit for an LBMJP in the small jump limit, and discuss applications to Monte Carlo sampling and non-reversible extensions of the processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Markov Processes, Sampling Algorithms, Mixing Times, Ergodicity, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Locally-balanced processes. 31 pages. 31 pages</p></details> |

However, current methods rely on 2D diffusion models without adequately considering multi-view information, resulting in multi-view inconsistency. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) significantly improves rendering quality and speed, its 3D editing process encounters difficulties with inefficient optimization, as pre-trained Gaussians retain excessive source information, hindering optimization. To address these limitations, we propose EditSplat, a novel text-driven 3D scene editing framework that integrates Multi-view Fusion Guidance (MFG) and Attention-Guided Trimming (AGT). Our MFG ensures multi-view consistency by incorporating essential multi-view information into the diffusion process, leveraging classifier-free guidance from the text-to-image diffusion model and the geometric structure inherent to 3DGS. Additionally, our AGT utilizes the explicit representation of 3DGS to selectively prune and optimize 3D Gaussians, enhancing optimization efficiency and enabling precise, semantically rich local editing. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, EditSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a new benchmark for text-driven 3D scene editing.</p></details> |  |

Our algorithms rely on a quadrature method for the spatial discretization and the method of lines using a second-order Adams-Bashforth for the time marching. We focus on studying the impact of the type of boundary constraints, e.g. nonlocal Dirichlet/Neumann or local periodic, and the type of nonlocal diffusion, i.e. integral operator with thin- or fat-tailed kernels, on the generation of pulse solutions. Our numerical investigations show that when the spread of the kernel is large, i.e. when the model is nonlocal, both the type of kernels and type of boundary constraints have a strong impact on the solutions profiles.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |
| **[PriorDiffusion: Leverage Language Prior in Diffusion Models for Monocular Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16750v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional monocular depth estimation suffers from inherent ambiguity and visual nuisance. We argue that language prior can enhance monocular depth estimation by leveraging the inductive bias learned during the text-to-image pre-training of diffusion models. The ability of these models to generate images that align with text indicates that they have learned the spatial relationships, size, and shape of specified objects, which can be applied to improve depth estimation. Thus, we propose PriorDiffusion, using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that takes both images and corresponding text descriptions to infer affine-invariant depth through a denoising process. We also show that language prior enhances the model's perception of specific regions of images that users care about and describe. Simultaneously, language prior acts as a constraint to accelerate the convergence of both training and the inference diffusion trajectory. By training on HyperSim and Virtual KITTI, we achieve faster training convergence, fewer inference diffusion steps, and state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across NYUv2, KITTI, ETH3D, and ScanNet. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Shot Shape and Reflectance with Spatial Polarization Multiplexing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13177v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose spatial polarization multiplexing (SPM) for reconstructing object shape and reflectance from a single polarimetric image and demonstrate its application to dynamic surface recovery. Although single-pattern structured light enables single-shot shape reconstruction, the reflectance is challenging to recover due to the lack of angular sampling of incident light and the entanglement of the projected pattern and the surface color texture. We design a spatially multiplexed pattern of polarization that can be robustly and uniquely decoded for shape reconstruction by quantizing the AoLP values. At the same time, our spatial-multiplexing enables single-shot ellipsometry of linear polarization by projecting differently polarized light within a local region, which separates the specular and diffuse reflections for BRDF estimation. We achieve this spatial polarization multiplexing with a constrained de Bruijn sequence. Unlike single-pattern structured light with intensity and color, our polarization pattern is invisible to the naked eye and retains the natural surface appearance which is essential for accurate appearance modeling and also interaction with people. We experimentally validate our method on real data. The results show that our method can recover the shape, the Mueller matrix, and the BRDF from a single-shot polarimetric image. We also demonstrate the application of our method to dynamic surfaces.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion models have dominated this domain, auto-regressive models, with their unified architecture for text and image modeling, remain underexplored for personalized image generation. This paper investigates the potential of optimizing auto-regressive models for personalized image synthesis, leveraging their inherent multimodal capabilities to perform this task. We propose a two-stage training strategy that combines optimization of text embeddings and fine-tuning of transformer layers. Our experiments on the auto-regressive model demonstrate that this method achieves comparable subject fidelity and prompt following to the leading diffusion-based personalization methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of auto-regressive models in personalized image generation, offering a new direction for future research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/KaiyueSun98/T2I-Personalization-with-AR</p></details> |

The challenge comprises two tracks: (i) Efficient Video Quality Assessment (KVQ), and (ii) Diffusion-based Image Super-Resolution (KwaiSR). Track 1 aims to advance the development of lightweight and efficient video quality assessment (VQA) models, with an emphasis on eliminating reliance on model ensembles, redundant weights, and other computationally expensive components in the previous IQA/VQA competitions. Track 2 introduces a new short-form UGC dataset tailored for single image super-resolution, i.e., the KwaiSR dataset. It consists of 1,800 synthetically generated S-UGC image pairs and 1,900 real-world S-UGC images, which are split into training, validation, and test sets using a ratio of 8:1:1. The primary objective of the challenge is to drive research that benefits the user experience of short-form UGC platforms such as Kwai and TikTok.

The straight-line, non-crossing trajectories of flow models pose challenges for diffusion-based approaches but also open avenues for novel solutions. In this paper, we introduce a predictor-corrector-based framework for inversion and editing in flow models. First, we propose Uni-Inv, an effective inversion method designed for accurate reconstruction. Building on this, we extend the concept of delayed injection to flow models and introduce Uni-Edit, a region-aware, robust image editing approach. Our methodology is tuning-free, model-agnostic, efficient, and effective, enabling diverse edits while ensuring strong preservation of edit-irrelevant regions. Extensive experiments across various generative models demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of Uni-Inv and Uni-Edit, even under low-cost settings.

VTON generates images of a person in a specified garment using a target photo and a standardized garment image, while a more challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, on the other hand, extracts standardized garment images from clothed individuals. We introduce TryOffDiff, a diffusion-based VTOFF model. Built on a latent diffusion framework with SigLIP image conditioning, it effectively captures garment properties like texture, shape, and patterns. TryOffDiff achieves state-of-the-art results on VITON-HD and strong performance on DressCode dataset, covering upper-body, lower-body, and dresses. Enhanced with class-specific embeddings, it pioneers multi-garment VTOFF, the first of its kind. When paired with VTON models, it improves p2p-VTON by minimizing unwanted attribute transfer, such as skin color. Code is available at: https://rizavelioglu.github.io/tryoffdiff/</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present HiScene, a novel hierarchical framework that bridges the gap between 2D image generation and 3D object generation and delivers high-fidelity scenes with compositional identities and aesthetic scene content. Our key insight is treating scenes as hierarchical "objects" under isometric views, where a room functions as a complex object that can be further decomposed into manipulatable items. This hierarchical approach enables us to generate 3D content that aligns with 2D representations while maintaining compositional structure. To ensure completeness and spatial alignment of each decomposed instance, we develop a video-diffusion-based amodal completion technique that effectively handles occlusions and shadows between objects, and introduce shape prior injection to ensure spatial coherence within the scene. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces more natural object arrangements and complete object instances suitable for interactive applications, while maintaining physical plausibility and alignment with user inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://zju3dv.github.io/hiscene/</p></details> |
| **[Learning Diverse Robot Striking Motions with Diffusion Models and Kinematically Constrained Gradient Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15528v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in robot learning have enabled robots to generate skills for a variety of tasks. Yet, robot learning is typically sample inefficient, struggles to learn from data sources exhibiting varied behaviors, and does not naturally incorporate constraints. These properties are critical for fast, agile tasks such as playing table tennis. Modern techniques for learning from demonstration improve sample efficiency and scale to diverse data, but are rarely evaluated on agile tasks. In the case of reinforcement learning, achieving good performance requires training on high-fidelity simulators. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel diffusion modeling approach that is offline, constraint-guided, and expressive of diverse agile behaviors. The key to our approach is a kinematic constraint gradient guidance (KCGG) technique that computes gradients through both the forward kinematics of the robot arm and the diffusion model to direct the sampling process. KCGG minimizes the cost of violating constraints while simultaneously keeping the sampled trajectory in-distribution of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for time-critical robotic tasks by evaluating KCGG in two challenging domains: simulated air hockey and real table tennis. In simulated air hockey, we achieved a 25.4% increase in block rate, while in table tennis, we saw a 17.3% increase in success rate compared to imitation learning baselines.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[ArtistAuditor: Auditing Artist Style Pirate in Text-to-Image Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13061v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models based on diffusion processes, such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, are capable of transforming texts into detailed images and have widespread applications in art and design. As such, amateur users can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's work and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright infringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually imperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles (perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in the artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model has been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model retraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable. To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the text-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to identify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of specific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely, ArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style representations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then, ArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions. The experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that ArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying ArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights into the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario.

However, the time-consuming deployment, long inference time, and requirements on large memory hinder their applications on resource constrained devices. In this paper, we propose a method based on the improved Straight-Through Estimator to improve the deployment efficiency of diffusion models. Specifically, we add sparse masks to the Convolution and Linear layers in a pre-trained diffusion model, then transfer learn the sparse model during the fine-tuning stage and turn on the sparse masks during inference. Experimental results on a Transformer and UNet-based diffusion models demonstrate that our method reduces MACs by 50% while maintaining FID. Sparse models are accelerated by approximately 1.2x on the GPU. Under other MACs conditions, the FID is also lower than 1 compared to other methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods face three key challenges: (1) Difficulty in extracting multi-scale features from spatially heterogeneous RS scenes, (2) Limited prior information causing semantic inconsistency in reconstructions, and (3) Trade-off imbalance between geometric accuracy and visual quality. To address these issues, we propose the Texture Transfer Residual Denoising Dual Diffusion Model (TTRD3) with three innovations: First, a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Block (MFAB) employing parallel heterogeneous convolutional kernels for multi-scale feature extraction. Second, a Sparse Texture Transfer Guidance (STTG) module that transfers HR texture priors from reference images of similar scenes. Third, a Residual Denoising Dual Diffusion Model (RDDM) framework combining residual diffusion for deterministic reconstruction and noise diffusion for diverse generation. Experiments on multi-source RS datasets demonstrate TTRD3's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.43% LPIPS improvement and 3.67% FID enhancement compared to best-performing baselines.

| **[Long-Context Autoregressive Video Modeling with Next-Frame Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19325v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context autoregressive modeling has significantly advanced language generation, but video generation still struggles to fully utilize extended temporal contexts. To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce Frame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive modeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens (i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous frames, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion transformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling faces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is computationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language tokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range dependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution short-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an unlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer tokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a manageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time and memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to support the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on long video sequences. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet effective baseline for video autoregressive modeling.

We target the computations of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) transfer functions for large-scale discretizations of problems with continuous spectral measures, such as linear time-invariant (LTI) PDEs on unbounded domains. Traditional Krylov methods, such as the Lanczos or CG algorithm, are known to be optimal for the computation of $(A+sI)^{-1}B$ with real positive $s$, resulting in an adaptation to the distinctively discrete and nonuniform spectra. However, the adaptation is damped for matrices with dense spectra. It was demonstrated in [Zimmerling, Druskin, Simoncini, Journal of Scientific Computing 103(1), 5 (2025)] that averaging Gau{\ss} and Gau\ss -Radau quadratures computed using the block-Lanczos method significantly reduces approximation errors for such problems. Here, we introduce an adaptive Kre\u{i}n-Nudelman extension to the (block) Lanczos recursions, allowing further acceleration at negligible $o(n)$ cost. Similar to the Gau\ss -Radau quadrature, a low-rank modification is applied to the (block) Lanczos matrix. However, unlike the Gau\ss -Radau quadrature, this modification depends on $\sqrt{s}$ and can be considered in the framework of the Hermite-Pad\'e approximants, which are known to be efficient for problems with branch-cuts, that can be good approximations to dense spectral intervals. Numerical results for large-scale discretizations of heat-diffusion and quasi-magnetostatic Maxwell's operators in unbounded domains confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Block...</summary><p>Block Lanczos, Quadrature, Transfer function, Kre\u{i}n-Nudelman, Hermite-Pad\'e</p></details> |
| **[ArtCrafter: Text-Image Aligning Style Transfer via Embedding Reframing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02064v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in text-guided style transfer, primarily attributed to innovations in diffusion models. These models excel in conditional guidance, utilizing text or images to direct the sampling process. However, despite their capabilities, direct conditional guidance approaches often face challenges in balancing the expressiveness of textual semantics with the diversity of output results while capturing stylistic features. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtCrafter, a novel framework for text-to-image style transfer. Specifically, we introduce an attention-based style extraction module, meticulously engineered to capture the subtle stylistic elements within an image. This module features a multi-layer architecture that leverages the capabilities of perceiver attention mechanisms to integrate fine-grained information. Additionally, we present a novel text-image aligning augmentation component that adeptly balances control over both modalities, enabling the model to efficiently map image and text embeddings into a shared feature space. We achieve this through attention operations that enable smooth information flow between modalities. Lastly, we incorporate an explicit modulation that seamlessly blends multimodal enhanced embeddings with original embeddings through an embedding reframing design, empowering the model to generate diverse outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ArtCrafter yields impressive results in visual stylization, exhibiting exceptional levels of stylistic intensity, controllability, and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 17 figures, submitted to a journal</p></details> |

| **[Wavelet Diffusion Neural Operator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04833v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating and controlling physical systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial tasks across science and engineering. Recently, diffusion generative models have emerged as a competitive class of methods for these tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies and model high-dimensional states. However, diffusion models typically struggle with handling system states with abrupt changes and generalizing to higher resolutions. In this work, we propose Wavelet Diffusion Neural Operator (WDNO), a novel PDE simulation and control framework that enhances the handling of these complexities. WDNO comprises two key innovations. Firstly, WDNO performs diffusion-based generative modeling in the wavelet domain for the entire trajectory to handle abrupt changes and long-term dependencies effectively. Secondly, to address the issue of poor generalization across different resolutions, which is one of the fundamental tasks in modeling physical systems, we introduce multi-resolution training. We validate WDNO on five physical systems, including 1D advection equation, three challenging physical systems with abrupt changes (1D Burgers' equation, 1D compressible Navier-Stokes equation and 2D incompressible fluid), and a real-world dataset ERA5, which demonstrates superior performance on both simulation and control tasks over state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in long-term and detail prediction accuracy. Remarkably, in the challenging context of the 2D high-dimensional and indirect control task aimed at reducing smoke leakage, WDNO reduces the leakage by 33.2% compared to the second-best baseline.

| **[Test-time Alignment of Diffusion Models without Reward Over-optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05803v3)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel in generative tasks, but aligning them with specific objectives while maintaining their versatility remains challenging. Existing fine-tuning methods often suffer from reward over-optimization, while approximate guidance approaches fail to optimize target rewards effectively. Addressing these limitations, we propose a training-free, test-time method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the reward-aligned target distribution. Our approach, tailored for diffusion sampling and incorporating tempering techniques, achieves comparable or superior target rewards to fine-tuning methods while preserving diversity and cross-reward generalization. We demonstrate its effectiveness in single-reward optimization, multi-objective scenarios, and online black-box optimization. This work offers a robust solution for aligning diffusion models with diverse downstream objectives without compromising their general capabilities.
