| **[Understanding and Mitigating Distribution Shifts For Machine Learning Force Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08674v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are a promising alternative to expensive ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations. Given the diversity of chemical spaces that are of interest and the cost of generating new data, it is important to understand how MLFFs generalize beyond their training distributions. In order to characterize and better understand distribution shifts in MLFFs, we conduct diagnostic experiments on chemical datasets, revealing common shifts that pose significant challenges, even for large foundation models trained on extensive data. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that current supervised training methods inadequately regularize MLFFs, resulting in overfitting and learning poor representations of out-of-distribution systems. We then propose two new methods as initial steps for mitigating distribution shifts for MLFFs. Our methods focus on test-time refinement strategies that incur minimal computational cost and do not use expensive ab initio reference labels. The first strategy, based on spectral graph theory, modifies the edges of test graphs to align with graph structures seen during training. Our second strategy improves representations for out-of-distribution systems at test-time by taking gradient steps using an auxiliary objective, such as a cheap physical prior. Our test-time refinement strategies significantly reduce errors on out-of-distribution systems, suggesting that MLFFs are capable of and can move towards modeling diverse chemical spaces, but are not being effectively trained to do so. Our experiments establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the generalization capabilities of the next generation of MLFFs. Our code is available at https://tkreiman.github.io/projects/mlff_distribution_shifts/.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address key limitations in state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods for reassembly, namely i) scalability; ii) multimodality; and iii) real-world applicability: beyond square or simple geometric shapes, realistic and complex erosion, or other real-world problems. We propose ReassembleNet, a method that reduces complexity by representing each input piece as a set of contour keypoints and learning to select the most informative ones by Graph Neural Networks pooling inspired techniques. ReassembleNet effectively lowers computational complexity while enabling the integration of features from multiple modalities, including both geometric and texture data. Further enhanced through pretraining on a semi-synthetic dataset. We then apply diffusion-based pose estimation to recover the original structure. We improve on prior methods by 55% and 86% for RMSE Rotation and Translation, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[An additive two-level parallel variant of the DMRG algorithm with coarse-space correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23429v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is a popular alternating minimization scheme for solving high-dimensional optimization problems in the tensor train format. Classical DMRG, however, is based on sequential minimization, which raises challenges in its implementation on parallel computing architectures. To overcome this, we propose a novel additive two-level DMRG algorithm that combines independent, local minimization steps with a global update step using a subsequent coarse-space minimization. Our proposed algorithm, which is directly inspired by additive Schwarz methods from the domain decomposition literature, is particularly amenable to implementation on parallel, distributed architectures since both the local minimization steps and the construction of the coarse-space can be performed in parallel. Numerical experiments on strongly correlated molecular systems demonstrate that the method achieves competitive convergence rates while achieving significant parallel speedups.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages (including supplementary materials), 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Representing local protein environments with atomistic foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23354v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The local structure of a protein strongly impacts its function and interactions with other molecules. Therefore, a concise, informative representation of a local protein environment is essential for modeling and designing proteins and biomolecular interactions. However, these environments' extensive structural and chemical variability makes them challenging to model, and such representations remain under-explored. In this work, we propose a novel representation for a local protein environment derived from the intermediate features of atomistic foundation models (AFMs). We demonstrate that this embedding effectively captures both local structure (e.g., secondary motifs), and chemical features (e.g., amino-acid identity and protonation state). We further show that the AFM-derived representation space exhibits meaningful structure, enabling the construction of data-driven priors over the distribution of biomolecular environments. Finally, in the context of biomolecular NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the proposed representations enable a first-of-its-kind physics-informed chemical shift predictor that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Our results demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of atomistic foundation models and their emergent representations for protein modeling beyond traditional molecular simulations. We believe this will open new lines of work in constructing effective functional representations for protein environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Spherical Transformer for Efficient Molecular Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23086v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SE(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced molecular system modeling by employing group representations. However, their message passing processes, which rely on tensor product-based convolutions, are limited by insufficient non-linearity and incomplete group representations, thereby restricting expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel framework that leverages a Transformer structure within the spatial domain of group representations after Fourier transform. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that EST can encompass the function space of tensor products while achieving superior expressiveness. Furthermore, EST's equivariant inductive bias is guaranteed through a uniform sampling strategy for the Fourier transform. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by EST on various molecular benchmarks, including OC20 and QM9.</p></details> | 24 pages, 3 figures |

| **[Foundation Molecular Grammar: Multi-Modal Foundation Models Induce Interpretable Molecular Graph Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22948v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent data-efficient molecular generation approaches exploit graph grammars to introduce interpretability into the generative models. However, grammar learning therein relies on expert annotation or unreliable heuristics for algorithmic inference. We propose Foundation Molecular Grammar (FMG), which leverages multi-modal foundation models (MMFMs) to induce an interpretable molecular language. By exploiting the chemical knowledge of an MMFM, FMG renders molecules as images, describes them as text, and aligns information across modalities using prompt learning. FMG can be used as a drop-in replacement for the prior grammar learning approaches in molecular generation and property prediction. We show that FMG not only excels in synthesizability, diversity, and data efficiency but also offers built-in chemical interpretability for automated molecular discovery workflows. Code is available at https://github.com/shiningsunnyday/induction.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Adjoint Sampling: Highly Scalable Diffusion Samplers via Adjoint Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11713v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Adjoint Sampling, a highly scalable and efficient algorithm for learning diffusion processes that sample from unnormalized densities, or energy functions. It is the first on-policy approach that allows significantly more gradient updates than the number of energy evaluations and model samples, allowing us to scale to much larger problem settings than previously explored by similar methods. Our framework is theoretically grounded in stochastic optimal control and shares the same theoretical guarantees as Adjoint Matching, being able to train without the need for corrective measures that push samples towards the target distribution. We show how to incorporate key symmetries, as well as periodic boundary conditions, for modeling molecules in both cartesian and torsional coordinates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on classical energy functions, and further scale up to neural network-based energy models where we perform amortized conformer generation across many molecular systems. To encourage further research in developing highly scalable sampling methods, we plan to open source these challenging benchmarks, where successful methods can directly impact progress in computational chemistry.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffMS: Diffusion Generation of Molecules Conditioned on Mass Spectra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09571v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mass spectrometry plays a fundamental role in elucidating the structures of unknown molecules and subsequent scientific discoveries. One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional de novo generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on de novo molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size. DiffMS code is publicly available at https://github.com/coleygroup/DiffMS.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[HybridLinker: Topology-Guided Posterior Sampling for Enhanced Diversity and Validity in 3D Molecular Linker Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17349v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linker generation is critical in drug discovery applications such as lead optimization and PROTAC design, where molecular fragments are assembled into diverse drug candidates via molecular linker. Existing methods fall into point cloud-free and point cloud-aware categories based on their use of fragments' 3D poses alongside their topologies in sampling the linker's topology. Point cloud-free models prioritize sample diversity but suffer from lower validity due to overlooking fragments' spatial constraints, while point cloud-aware models ensure higher validity but restrict diversity by enforcing strict spatial constraints. To overcome these trade-offs without additional training, we propose HybridLinker, a framework that enhances point cloud-aware inference by providing diverse bonding topologies from a pretrained point cloud-free model as guidance. At its core, we propose LinkerDPS, the first diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) method operating across point cloud-free and point cloud-aware spaces, bridging molecular topology with 3D point clouds via an energy-inspired function. By transferring the diverse sampling distribution of point cloud-free models into the point cloud-aware distribution, HybridLinker significantly surpasses baselines, improving both validity and diversity in foundational molecular design and applied drug optimization tasks, establishing a new DPS framework in the molecular domains beyond imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenMol: A Drug Discovery Generalist with Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06158v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is a complex process that involves multiple stages and tasks. However, existing molecular generative models can only tackle some of these tasks. We present Generalist Molecular generative model (GenMol), a versatile framework that uses only a single discrete diffusion model to handle diverse drug discovery scenarios. GenMol generates Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing the utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering while having better sampling efficiency. GenMol uses fragments as basic building blocks for molecules and introduces fragment remasking, a strategy that optimizes molecules by regenerating masked fragments, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. We further propose molecular context guidance (MCG), a guidance method tailored for masked discrete diffusion of GenMol. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model in de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization. These results demonstrate that GenMol can tackle a wide range of drug discovery tasks, providing a unified and versatile approach for molecular design.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[UniMoMo: Unified Generative Modeling of 3D Molecules for De Novo Binder Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19300v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of target-specific molecules such as small molecules, peptides, and antibodies is vital for biological research and drug discovery. Existing generative methods are restricted to single-domain molecules, failing to address versatile therapeutic needs or utilize cross-domain transferability to enhance model performance. In this paper, we introduce Unified generative Modeling of 3D Molecules (UniMoMo), the first framework capable of designing binders of multiple molecular domains using a single model. In particular, UniMoMo unifies the representations of different molecules as graphs of blocks, where each block corresponds to either a standard amino acid or a molecular fragment. Subsequently, UniMoMo utilizes a geometric latent diffusion model for 3D molecular generation, featuring an iterative full-atom autoencoder to compress blocks into latent space points, followed by an E(3)-equivariant diffusion process. Extensive benchmarks across peptides, antibodies, and small molecules demonstrate the superiority of our unified framework over existing domain-specific models, highlighting the benefits of multi-domain training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Finding Pathways in Reaction Networks guided by Energy Barriers using Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10609v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing synthesis pathways for target molecules in a chemical reaction network annotated with information on the kinetics of individual reactions is an area of active study. This work presents a computational methodology for searching for pathways in reaction networks which is based on integer linear programming and the modeling of reaction networks by directed hypergraphs. Often multiple pathways fit the given search criteria. To rank them, we develop an objective function based on physical arguments maximizing the probability of the pathway. We furthermore develop an automated pipeline to estimate the energy barriers of individual reactions in reaction networks. Combined, the methodology facilitates flexible and kinetically informed pathway investigations on large reaction networks by computational means, even for networks coming without kinetic annotation, such as those created via generative approaches for expanding molecular spaces.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning for Multi-task Molecule Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18084v5)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in various natural language processing tasks such as question answering and machine translation. However, due to the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of manual annotation for biochemical properties, the performance for molecule generation tasks is still limited, especially for tasks involving multi-properties constraints. In this work, we present a two-step framework PEIT (Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning) to improve LLMs for molecular-related tasks. In the first step, we use textual descriptions, SMILES, and biochemical properties as multimodal inputs to pre-train a model called PEIT-GEN, by aligning multi-modal representations to synthesize instruction data. In the second step, we fine-tune existing open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the resulting PEIT-LLM can handle molecule captioning, text-based molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and our newly proposed multi-constraint molecule generation tasks. Experimental results show that our pre-trained PEIT-GEN outperforms MolT5 and BioT5 in molecule captioning, demonstrating modalities align well between textual descriptions, structures, and biochemical properties. Furthermore, PEIT-LLM shows promising improvements in multi-task molecule generation, proving the scalability of the PEIT framework for various molecular tasks. We release the code, constructed instruction data, and model checkpoints in https://github.com/chenlong164/PEIT.</p></details> | 9 |
| **[On scalable and efficient training of diffusion samplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19552v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of training diffusion models to sample from unnormalized energy distributions in the absence of data, the so-called diffusion samplers. Although these approaches have shown promise, they struggle to scale in more demanding scenarios where energy evaluations are expensive and the sampling space is high-dimensional. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable and sample-efficient framework that properly harmonizes the powerful classical sampling method and the diffusion sampler. Specifically, we utilize Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) samplers with a novelty-based auxiliary energy as a Searcher to collect off-policy samples, using an auxiliary energy function to compensate for exploring modes the diffusion sampler rarely visits. These off-policy samples are then combined with on-policy data to train the diffusion sampler, thereby expanding its coverage of the energy landscape. Furthermore, we identify primacy bias, i.e., the preference of samplers for early experience during training, as the main cause of mode collapse during training, and introduce a periodic re-initialization trick to resolve this issue. Our method significantly improves sample efficiency on standard benchmarks for diffusion samplers and also excels at higher-dimensional problems and real-world molecular conformer generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v2)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Guided Multi-Property Molecular Optimization with a Diffusion Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13597v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization (MO) is a crucial stage in drug discovery in which task-oriented generated molecules are optimized to meet practical industrial requirements. Existing mainstream MO approaches primarily utilize external property predictors to guide iterative property optimization. However, learning all molecular samples in the vast chemical space is unrealistic for predictors. As a result, errors and noise are inevitably introduced during property prediction due to the nature of approximation. This leads to discrepancy accumulation, generalization reduction and suboptimal molecular candidates. In this paper, we propose a text-guided multi-property molecular optimization method utilizing transformer-based diffusion language model (TransDLM). TransDLM leverages standardized chemical nomenclature as semantic representations of molecules and implicitly embeds property requirements into textual descriptions, thereby mitigating error propagation during diffusion process. By fusing physically and chemically detailed textual semantics with specialized molecular representations, TransDLM effectively integrates diverse information sources to guide precise optimization, which enhances the model's ability to balance structural retention and property enhancement. Additionally, the success of a case study further demonstrates TransDLM's ability to solve practical problems. Experimentally, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in maintaining molecular structural similarity and enhancing chemical properties on the benchmark dataset. The code is available at: https://github.com/Cello2195/TransDLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Applications of Modular Co-Design for De Novo 3D Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18392v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>De novo 3D molecule generation is a pivotal task in drug discovery. However, many recent geometric generative models struggle to produce high-quality 3D structures, even if they maintain 2D validity and topological stability. To tackle this issue and enhance the learning of effective molecular generation dynamics, we present Megalodon-a family of scalable transformer models. These models are enhanced with basic equivariant layers and trained using a joint continuous and discrete denoising co-design objective. We assess Megalodon's performance on established molecule generation benchmarks and introduce new 3D structure benchmarks that evaluate a model's capability to generate realistic molecular structures, particularly focusing on energetics. We show that Megalodon achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D molecule generation, conditional structure generation, and structure energy benchmarks using diffusion and flow matching. Furthermore, doubling the number of parameters in Megalodon to 40M significantly enhances its performance, generating up to 49x more valid large molecules and achieving energy levels that are 2-10x lower than those of the best prior generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolMiner: Towards Controllable, 3D-Aware, Fragment-Based Molecular Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06608v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MolMiner, a fragment-based, geometry-aware, and order-agnostic autoregressive model for molecular design. MolMiner supports conditional generation of molecules over twelve properties, enabling flexible control across physicochemical and structural targets. Molecules are built via symmetry-aware fragment attachments, with 3D geometry dynamically updated during generation using forcefields. A probabilistic conditioning mechanism allows users to specify any subset of target properties while sampling the rest. MolMiner achieves calibrated conditional generation across most properties and offers competitive unconditional performance. We also propose improved benchmarking methods for both unconditional and conditional generation, including distributional comparisons via Wasserstein distance and calibration plots for property control. To our knowledge, this is the first model to unify dynamic geometry, symmetry handling, order-agnostic fragment-based generation, and high-dimensional multi-property conditioning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Large Language Models for Text-Guided Molecular Discovery: from Molecule Generation to Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16094v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are introducing a paradigm shift in molecular discovery by enabling text-guided interaction with chemical spaces through natural language, symbolic notations, with emerging extensions to incorporate multi-modal inputs. To advance the new field of LLM for molecular discovery, this survey provides an up-to-date and forward-looking review of the emerging use of LLMs for two central tasks: molecule generation and molecule optimization. Based on our proposed taxonomy for both problems, we analyze representative techniques in each category, highlighting how LLM capabilities are leveraged across different learning settings. In addition, we include the commonly used datasets and evaluation protocols. We conclude by discussing key challenges and future directions, positioning this survey as a resource for researchers working at the intersection of LLMs and molecular science.

| **[MolLangBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Language-Prompted Molecular Structure Recognition, Editing, and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15054v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise recognition, editing, and generation of molecules are essential prerequisites for both chemists and AI systems tackling various chemical tasks. We present MolLangBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate fundamental molecule-language interface tasks: language-prompted molecular structure recognition, editing, and generation. To ensure high-quality, unambiguous, and deterministic outputs, we construct the recognition tasks using automated cheminformatics tools, and curate editing and generation tasks through rigorous expert annotation and validation. MolLangBench supports the evaluation of models that interface language with different molecular representations, including linear strings, molecular images, and molecular graphs. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal significant limitations: the strongest model (o3) achieves $79.2\%$ and $78.5\%$ accuracy on recognition and editing tasks, which are intuitively simple for humans, and performs even worse on the generation task, reaching only $29.0\%$ accuracy. These results highlight the shortcomings of current AI systems in handling even preliminary molecular recognition and manipulation tasks. We hope MolLangBench will catalyze further research toward more effective and reliable AI systems for chemical applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[AMBER: Adaptive Mesh Generation by Iterative Mesh Resolution Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23663v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cost and accuracy of simulating complex physical systems using the Finite Element Method (FEM) scales with the resolution of the underlying mesh. Adaptive meshes improve computational efficiency by refining resolution in critical regions, but typically require task-specific heuristics or cumbersome manual design by a human expert. We propose Adaptive Meshing By Expert Reconstruction (AMBER), a supervised learning approach to mesh adaptation. Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e., a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes. AMBER generalizes to unseen geometries and consistently outperforms multiple recent baselines, including ones using Graph and Convolutional Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support our findings.</p></details> | 69 pages, 8 figures |

Ultrasound imaging, a widely used and cost-effective medical diagnostic procedure, faces challenges due to the global shortage of professional sonographers. To address this issue, we propose USPilot, an embodied robotic assistant ultrasound system powered by an LLM-based framework to enable autonomous ultrasound acquisition. USPilot is designed to function as a virtual sonographer, capable of responding to patients' ultrasound-related queries and performing ultrasound scans based on user intent. By fine-tuning the LLM, USPilot demonstrates a deep understanding of ultrasound-specific questions and tasks. Furthermore, USPilot incorporates an LLM-enhanced Graph Neural Network (GNN) to manage ultrasound robotic APIs and serve as a task planner. Experimental results show that the LLM-enhanced GNN achieves unprecedented accuracy in task planning on public datasets. Additionally, the system demonstrates significant potential in autonomously understanding and executing ultrasound procedures. These advancements bring us closer to achieving autonomous and potentially unmanned robotic ultrasound systems, addressing critical resource gaps in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

Trojan Prompt Attacks on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13974v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has been introduced as a promising approach that uses prompts to adapt pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks without requiring fine-tuning of the entire model. Despite the advantages of GPL, little attention has been given to its vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where an adversary can manipulate the model's behavior by embedding hidden triggers. Existing graph backdoor attacks rely on modifying model parameters during training, but this approach is impractical in GPL as GNN encoder parameters are frozen after pre-training. Moreover, downstream users may fine-tune their own task models on clean datasets, further complicating the attack. In this paper, we propose TGPA, a backdoor attack framework designed specifically for GPL. TGPA injects backdoors into graph prompts without modifying pre-trained GNN encoders and ensures high attack success rates and clean accuracy. To address the challenge of model fine-tuning by users, we introduce a finetuning-resistant poisoning approach that maintains the effectiveness of the backdoor even after downstream model adjustments. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of TGPA in compromising GPL models with fixed GNN encoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be appeared in KDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Signed Graph Approach to Understanding and Mitigating Oversmoothing in GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11394v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep graph neural networks (GNNs) often suffer from oversmoothing, where node representations become overly homogeneous with increasing depth. While techniques like normalization, residual connections, and edge dropout have been proposed to mitigate oversmoothing, they are typically developed independently, with limited theoretical understanding of their underlying mechanisms. In this work, we present a unified theoretical perspective based on the framework of signed graphs, showing that many existing strategies implicitly introduce negative edges that alter message-passing to resist oversmoothing. However, we show that merely adding negative edges in an unstructured manner is insufficient-the asymptotic behavior of signed propagation depends critically on the strength and organization of positive and negative edges. To address this limitation, we leverage the theory of structural balance, which promotes stable, cluster-preserving dynamics by connecting similar nodes with positive edges and dissimilar ones with negative edges. We propose Structural Balanced Propagation (SBP), a plug-and-play method that assigns signed edges based on either labels or feature similarity to explicitly enhance structural balance in the constructed signed graphs. Experiments on nine benchmarks across both homophilic and heterophilic settings demonstrate that SBP consistently improves classification accuracy and mitigates oversmoothing, even at depths of up to 300 layers. Our results provide a principled explanation for prior oversmoothing remedies and introduce a new direction for signed message-passing design in deep GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-training for Recommendation Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22649v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern recommender systems powered by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling complex user-item interactions, yet increasingly face scenarios requiring selective forgetting of training data. Beyond user requests to remove specific interactions due to privacy concerns or preference changes, regulatory frameworks mandate recommender systems' ability to eliminate the influence of certain user data from models. This recommendation unlearning challenge presents unique difficulties as removing connections within interaction graphs creates ripple effects throughout the model, potentially impacting recommendations for numerous users. Traditional approaches suffer from significant drawbacks: fragmentation methods damage graph structure and diminish performance, while influence function techniques make assumptions that may not hold in complex GNNs, particularly with self-supervised or random architectures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model-agnostic pre-training paradigm UnlearnRec that prepares systems for efficient unlearning operations. Our Influence Encoder takes unlearning requests together with existing model parameters and directly produces updated parameters of unlearned model with little fine-tuning, avoiding complete retraining while preserving model performance characteristics. Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks demonstrates that our method delivers exceptional unlearning effectiveness while providing more than 10x speedup compared to retraining approaches. We release our method implementation at: https://github.com/HKUDS/UnlearnRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGIR 2025 Oral</p></details> |

By introducing the proposed virtual node-splitting strategy, generator-level attributes like costs, limits, and ramp rates can be fully captured by GNN models, improving GNN's learning capacity and prediction accuracy. Optimal power flow (OPF) problem is used for real-time grid operations. Limited timeframe motivates studies to create size-reduced OPF (ROPF) models to relieve the computational complexity. In this paper, with virtual node-splitting, a novel two-stage adaptive hierarchical GNN is developed to (i) predict critical lines that would be congested, and then (ii) predict base generators that would operate at the maximum capacity. This will substantially reduce the constraints and variables needed for OPF, creating the proposed ROPFLG model with reduced monitor lines and reduced generator-specific variables and constraints. Two ROPF models, ROPFL and ROPFG, with just reduced lines or generators respectively, are also implemented as additional benchmark models. Case studies show that the proposed ROPFLG consistently outperforms the benchmark full OPF (FOPF) and the other two ROPF methods, achieving significant computational time savings while reliably finding optimal solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Spherical Transformer for Efficient Molecular Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23086v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SE(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced molecular system modeling by employing group representations. However, their message passing processes, which rely on tensor product-based convolutions, are limited by insufficient non-linearity and incomplete group representations, thereby restricting expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel framework that leverages a Transformer structure within the spatial domain of group representations after Fourier transform. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that EST can encompass the function space of tensor products while achieving superior expressiveness. Furthermore, EST's equivariant inductive bias is guaranteed through a uniform sampling strategy for the Fourier transform. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by EST on various molecular benchmarks, including OC20 and QM9.</p></details> | 24 pages, 3 figures |

However, self--attention, the core module of GTs, preserves only low-frequency signals in graph features, leading to ineffectiveness in capturing other important signals like high-frequency ones. Some recent GT models help alleviate this issue, but their flexibility and expressiveness are still limited since the filters they learn are fixed on predefined graph spectrum or spectral order. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Graph Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (GrokFormer), a novel GT model that learns highly expressive spectral filters with adaptive graph spectrum and spectral order through a Fourier series modeling over learnable activation functions. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the proposed GrokFormer filter offers better expressiveness than other spectral methods. Comprehensive experiments on 10 real-world node classification datasets across various domains, scales, and graph properties, as well as 5 graph classification datasets, show that GrokFormer outperforms state-of-the-art GTs and GNNs.

However, their scalability is hindered by the need for multi-hop data during inference, limiting their application in latency-sensitive scenarios. Recent efforts to distill GNNs into multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for faster inference often underutilize the layer-level insights of GNNs. In this paper, we present TINED, a novel approach that distills GNNs to MLPs on a layer-by-layer basis using Teacher Injection and Dirichlet Energy Distillation techniques. We focus on two key operations in GNN layers: feature transformation (FT) and graph propagation (GP). We recognize that FT is computationally equivalent to a fully-connected (FC) layer in MLPs. Thus, we propose directly transferring teacher parameters from an FT in a GNN to an FC layer in the student MLP, enhanced by fine-tuning. In TINED, the FC layers in an MLP replicate the sequence of FTs and GPs in the GNN. We also establish a theoretical bound for GP approximation. Furthermore, we note that FT and GP operations in GNN layers often exhibit opposing smoothing effects: GP is aggressive, while FT is conservative. Using Dirichlet energy, we develop a DE ratio to measure these effects and propose Dirichlet Energy Distillation to convey these characteristics from GNN layers to MLP layers. Extensive experiments show that TINED outperforms GNNs and leading distillation methods across various settings and seven datasets.

| **[One Model for One Graph: A New Perspective for Pretraining with Cross-domain Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00315v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool to capture intricate network patterns, achieving success across different domains. However, existing GNNs require careful domain-specific architecture designs and training from scratch on each dataset, leading to an expertise-intensive process with difficulty in generalizing across graphs from different domains. Therefore, it can be hard for practitioners to infer which GNN model can generalize well to graphs from their domains. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cross-domain pretraining framework, "one model for one graph," which overcomes the limitations of previous approaches that failed to use a single GNN to capture diverse graph patterns across domains with significant gaps. Specifically, we pretrain a bank of expert models, with each one corresponding to a specific dataset. When inferring to a new graph, gating functions choose a subset of experts to effectively integrate prior model knowledge while avoiding negative transfer. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method on both link prediction and node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Case-Based Reasoning Enhances the Predictive Power of LLMs in Drug-Drug Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23034v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is critical for treatment safety. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in pharmaceutical tasks, their effectiveness in DDI prediction remains challenging. Inspired by the well-established clinical practice where physicians routinely reference similar historical cases to guide their decisions through case-based reasoning (CBR), we propose CBR-DDI, a novel framework that distills pharmacological principles from historical cases to improve LLM reasoning for DDI tasks. CBR-DDI constructs a knowledge repository by leveraging LLMs to extract pharmacological insights and graph neural networks (GNNs) to model drug associations. A hybrid retrieval mechanism and dual-layer knowledge-enhanced prompting allow LLMs to effectively retrieve and reuse relevant cases. We further introduce a representative sampling strategy for dynamic case refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CBR-DDI achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a significant 28.7% accuracy improvement over both popular LLMs and CBR baseline, while maintaining high interpretability and flexibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Wave Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20034v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamics modeling has been introduced as a novel paradigm in message passing (MP) of graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing methods consider MP between nodes as a heat diffusion process, and leverage heat equation to model the temporal evolution of nodes in the embedding space. However, heat equation can hardly depict the wave nature of graph signals in graph signal processing. Besides, heat equation is essentially a partial differential equation (PDE) involving a first partial derivative of time, whose numerical solution usually has low stability, and leads to inefficient model training. In this paper, we would like to depict more wave details in MP, since graph signals are essentially wave signals that can be seen as a superposition of a series of waves in the form of eigenvector. This motivates us to consider MP as a wave propagation process to capture the temporal evolution of wave signals in the space. Based on wave equation in physics, we innovatively develop a graph wave equation to leverage the wave propagation on graphs. In details, we demonstrate that the graph wave equation can be connected to traditional spectral GNNs, facilitating the design of graph wave networks based on various Laplacians and enhancing the performance of the spectral GNNs. Besides, the graph wave equation is particularly a PDE involving a second partial derivative of time, which has stronger stability on graphs than the heat equation that involves a first partial derivative of time. Additionally, we theoretically prove that the numerical solution derived from the graph wave equation are constantly stable, enabling to significantly enhance model efficiency while ensuring its performance. Extensive experiments show that GWNs achieve SOTA and efficient performance on benchmark datasets, and exhibit outstanding performance in addressing challenging graph problems, such as over-smoothing and heterophily.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, published to WWW 2025</p></details> |

Traditional GNNs learns node features in a spatial domain unrelated to the topology, which can hardly ensure topological features. In this paper, we formulates message passing as a system of hyperbolic partial differential equations (hyperbolic PDEs), constituting a dynamical system that explicitly maps node representations into a particular solution space. This solution space is spanned by a set of eigenvectors describing the topological structure of graphs. Within this system, for any moment in time, a node features can be decomposed into a superposition of the basis of eigenvectors. This not only enhances the interpretability of message passing but also enables the explicit extraction of fundamental characteristics about the topological structure. Furthermore, by solving this system of hyperbolic partial differential equations, we establish a connection with spectral graph neural networks (spectral GNNs), serving as a message passing enhancement paradigm for spectral GNNs.We further introduce polynomials to approximate arbitrary filter functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the paradigm of hyperbolic PDEs not only exhibits strong flexibility but also significantly enhances the performance of various spectral GNNs across diverse graph tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures, published to ICML 2025</p></details> |

The scheme gives rise to two key challenges: over-smoothing and over-squashing. While several Dropout-style algorithms, such as DropEdge and DropMessage, have successfully addressed over-smoothing, their impact on over-squashing remains largely unexplored. This represents a critical gap in the literature, as failure to mitigate over-squashing would make these methods unsuitable for long-range tasks -- the intended use case of deep MPNNs. In this work, we study the aforementioned algorithms, and closely related edge-dropping algorithms -- DropNode, DropAgg and DropGNN -- in the context of over-squashing. We present theoretical results showing that DropEdge-variants reduce sensitivity between distant nodes, limiting their suitability for long-range tasks. To address this, we introduce DropSens, a sensitivity-aware variant of DropEdge that explicitly controls the proportion of information lost due to edge-dropping, thereby increasing sensitivity to distant nodes despite dropping the same number of edges. Our experiments on long-range synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the predicted limitations of existing edge-dropping and feature-dropping methods. Moreover, DropSens consistently outperforms graph rewiring techniques designed to mitigate over-squashing, suggesting that simple, targeted modifications can substantially improve a model's ability to capture long-range interactions. Our conclusions highlight the need to re-evaluate and re-design existing methods for training deep GNNs, with a renewed focus on modelling long-range interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 9 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Existing biomedical subgraph retrieval methods are tailored for graph neural networks (GNNs), limiting compatibility with other paradigms, including large language models (LLMs). We introduce K-Paths, a model-agnostic retrieval framework that extracts structured, diverse, and biologically meaningful multi-hop paths from dense biomedical KGs. These paths enable the prediction of unobserved drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, including those involving entities not seen during training, thus supporting inductive reasoning. K-Paths is training-free and employs a diversity-aware adaptation of Yen's algorithm to extract the K shortest loopless paths between entities in a query, prioritizing biologically relevant and relationally diverse connections. These paths serve as concise, interpretable reasoning chains that can be directly integrated with LLMs or GNNs to improve generalization, accuracy, and enable explainable inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that K-Paths improves zero-shot reasoning across state-of-the-art LLMs. For instance, Tx-Gemma 27B improves by 19.8 and 4.0 F1 points on interaction severity prediction and drug repurposing tasks, respectively. Llama 70B achieves gains of 8.5 and 6.2 points on the same tasks. K-Paths also boosts the training efficiency of EmerGNN, a state-of-the-art GNN, by reducing the KG size by 90% while maintaining predictive performance. Beyond efficiency, K-Paths bridges the gap between KGs and LLMs, enabling scalable and explainable LLM-augmented scientific discovery. We release our code and the retrieved paths as a benchmark for inductive reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphEval: A Lightweight Graph-Based LLM Framework for Idea Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12600v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their growing use in evaluating human-generated content, particularly in evaluating research ideas within academic settings. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompt-based LLM methods or fine-tuned lightweight language models for idea evaluation. However, these methods are often unstable and struggle to comprehend the complex semantic information embedded in the ideas, impeding their ability to perform high-quality evaluations. To address the above challenges, we propose GraphEval, a lightweight graph-based LLM framework for idea evaluation. Our insight is that a complex idea can be broken down into comprehensible viewpoint nodes using prompts from small LLMs. These viewpoint nodes can then be linked together through edges created from LLM-based relation extraction and/or BERT similarity scores. The created viewpoint-graph can be used to conveniently propagate scores across view-nodes to improve the robustness of the idea evaluations. In particular, we propose two lightweight graph-based methods for idea evaluation: (1) GraphEval-LP: a training-free label propagation algorithm that propagates evaluation scores from known view-nodes to unknown nodes; (2) GraphEval-GNN: a Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that is trained to predict the evaluation scores given the observed graph with minimal computation resources. Moreover, to overcome LLM's limitation in objectively assessing the novelty of ideas, we further propose a novelty detection model to GraphEval-GNN to enhance its capability in judging idea novelty. Experiments on two datasets show GraphEval improves F1 scores by at least 14% with low computation and API costs. Additionally, GraphEval can effectively detect plagiarized ideas.</p></details> |  |

While discriminative models have significantly advanced computer vision, they often struggle with compositional understanding. In contrast, recent generative text-to-image diffusion models excel at synthesizing complex scenes, suggesting inherent compositional capabilities. Building on this, zero-shot diffusion classifiers have been proposed to repurpose diffusion models for discriminative tasks. While prior work offered promising results in discriminative compositional scenarios, these results remain preliminary due to a small number of benchmarks and a relatively shallow analysis of conditions under which the models succeed. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of the discriminative capabilities of diffusion classifiers on a wide range of compositional tasks. Specifically, our study covers three diffusion models (SD 1.5, 2.0, and, for the first time, 3-m) spanning 10 datasets and over 30 tasks. Further, we shed light on the role that target dataset domains play in respective performance; to isolate the domain effects, we introduce a new diagnostic benchmark Self-Bench comprised of images created by diffusion models themselves. Finally, we explore the importance of timestep weighting and uncover a relationship between domain gap and timestep sensitivity, particularly for SD3-m. To sum up, diffusion classifiers understand compositionality, but conditions apply!

LoRAShop builds on a key observation about the feature interaction patterns inside Flux-style diffusion transformers: concept-specific transformer features activate spatially coherent regions early in the denoising process. We harness this observation to derive a disentangled latent mask for each concept in a prior forward pass and blend the corresponding LoRA weights only within regions bounding the concepts to be personalized. The resulting edits seamlessly integrate multiple subjects or styles into the original scene while preserving global context, lighting, and fine details. Our experiments demonstrate that LoRAShop delivers better identity preservation compared to baselines. By eliminating retraining and external constraints, LoRAShop turns personalized diffusion models into a practical `photoshop-with-LoRAs' tool and opens new avenues for compositional visual storytelling and rapid creative iteration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://lorashop.github.io/</p></details> |

With advanced computing hardware, traditional camera image signal processor (ISP) algorithms are gradually being replaced by efficient deep networks that enhance noisy raw images more intelligently. However, existing regression-based models often minimize pixel errors and result in oversmoothing of low-light photos or deep shadows. Recent work has attempted to address this limitation by training a diffusion model from scratch, yet those models still struggle to recover sharp image details and accurate colors. We introduce a novel framework to enhance low-light raw images by retasking pre-trained generative diffusion models with the camera ISP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in perceptual quality across three challenging low-light raw image benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, video generation based on multiple reference subjects still faces significant challenges in maintaining multi-subject consistency and ensuring high generation quality. In this paper, we propose MAGREF, a unified framework for any-reference video generation that introduces masked guidance to enable coherent multi-subject video synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images and a textual prompt. Specifically, we propose (1) a region-aware dynamic masking mechanism that enables a single model to flexibly handle various subject inference, including humans, objects, and backgrounds, without architectural changes, and (2) a pixel-wise channel concatenation mechanism that operates on the channel dimension to better preserve appearance features. Our model delivers state-of-the-art video generation quality, generalizing from single-subject training to complex multi-subject scenarios with coherent synthesis and precise control over individual subjects, outperforming existing open-source and commercial baselines. To facilitate evaluation, we also introduce a comprehensive multi-subject video benchmark.

However, popular image vectorization tools struggle with occluded regions, producing incomplete or fragmented shapes that hinder editability. While recent advancements have explored rule-based and data-driven layer-wise image vectorization, these methods face limitations in vectorization quality and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce LayerPeeler, a novel layer-wise image vectorization approach that addresses these challenges through a progressive simplification paradigm. The key to LayerPeeler's success lies in its autoregressive peeling strategy: by identifying and removing the topmost non-occluded layers while recovering underlying content, we generate vector graphics with complete paths and coherent layer structures. Our method leverages vision-language models to construct a layer graph that captures occlusion relationships among elements, enabling precise detection and description for non-occluded layers. These descriptive captions are used as editing instructions for a finetuned image diffusion model to remove the identified layers. To ensure accurate removal, we employ localized attention control that precisely guides the model to target regions while faithfully preserving the surrounding content. To support this, we contribute a large-scale dataset specifically designed for layer peeling tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LayerPeeler significantly outperforms existing techniques, producing vectorization results with superior path semantics, geometric regularity, and visual fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://layerpeeler.github.io/</p></details> |

These models have demonstrated significant ability to translate between the SMILES encodings of chemical products and reactants, but are constrained as a result of their autoregressive nature. We propose DiffER, an alternative template-free method for retrosynthesis prediction in the form of categorical diffusion, which allows the entire output SMILES sequence to be predicted in unison. We construct an ensemble of diffusion models which achieves state-of-the-art performance for top-1 accuracy and competitive performance for top-3, top-5, and top-10 accuracy among template-free methods. We prove that DiffER is a strong baseline for a new class of template-free model, capable of learning a variety of synthetic techniques used in laboratory settings and outperforming a variety of other template-free methods on top-k accuracy metrics. By constructing an ensemble of categorical diffusion models with a novel length prediction component with variance, our method is able to approximately sample from the posterior distribution of reactants, producing results with strong metrics of confidence and likelihood. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate that accurate prediction of the SMILES sequence length is key to further boosting the performance of categorical diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, the constraints of real-time control are often at odds with the design of VLMs: the most powerful VLMs have tens or hundreds of billions of parameters, presenting an obstacle to real-time inference, and operate on discrete tokens rather than the continuous-valued outputs that are required for controlling robots. To address this challenge, recent VLA models have used specialized modules for efficient continuous control, such as action experts or continuous output heads, which typically require adding new untrained parameters to the pretrained VLM backbone. While these modules improve real-time and control capabilities, it remains an open question whether they preserve or degrade the semantic knowledge contained in the pretrained VLM, and what effect they have on the VLA training dynamics. In this paper, we study this question in the context of VLAs that include a continuous diffusion or flow matching action expert, showing that naively including such experts significantly harms both training speed and knowledge transfer. We provide an extensive analysis of various design choices, their impact on performance and knowledge transfer, and propose a technique for insulating the VLM backbone during VLA training that mitigates this issue.

However, in clinical practice, the acquisition of certain sequences may be affected by factors like motion artifacts or contrast agent contraindications, leading to suboptimal outcome, such as poor image quality. This can then affect image interpretation by radiologists. Synthesizing high quality MRI sequences has thus become a critical research focus. Though recent advancements in controllable generative AI have facilitated the synthesis of diagnostic quality MRI, ensuring anatomical accuracy remains a significant challenge. Preserving critical structural relationships between different anatomical regions is essential, as even minor structural or topological inconsistencies can compromise diagnostic validity. In this work, we propose BrainMRDiff, a novel topology-preserving, anatomy-guided diffusion model for synthesizing brain MRI, leveraging brain and tumor anatomies as conditioning inputs. To achieve this, we introduce two key modules: Tumor+Structure Aggregation (TSA) and Topology-Guided Anatomy Preservation (TGAP). TSA integrates diverse anatomical structures with tumor information, forming a comprehensive conditioning mechanism for the diffusion process. TGAP enforces topological consistency during reverse denoising diffusion process; both these modules ensure that the generated image respects anatomical integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMRDiff surpasses existing baselines, achieving performance improvements of 23.33% on the BraTS-AG dataset and 33.33% on the BraTS-Met dataset.

Existing radiomics and deep learning-based predictive models rely primarily on pre-treatment imaging to predict categorical response outcomes, limiting their ability to capture the complex morphological and textural transformations induced by immunotherapy. This study introduces ImmunoDiff, an anatomy-aware diffusion model designed to synthesize post-treatment CT scans from baseline imaging while incorporating clinically relevant constraints. The proposed framework integrates anatomical priors, specifically lobar and vascular structures, to enhance fidelity in CT synthesis. Additionally, we introduce a novel cbi-Adapter, a conditioning module that ensures pairwise-consistent multimodal integration of imaging and clinical data embeddings, to refine the generative process. Additionally, a clinical variable conditioning mechanism is introduced, leveraging demographic data, blood-based biomarkers, and PD-L1 expression to refine the generative process. Evaluations on an in-house NSCLC cohort treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors demonstrate a 21.24% improvement in balanced accuracy for response prediction and a 0.03 increase in c-index for survival prediction.

Prior work on hand-object trajectory generation typically relies on textual input that lacks explicit grounding to the target object, or assumes access to 3D object meshes, which are often considerably more difficult to obtain than 2D images. We propose SIGHT-Fusion, a novel diffusion-based image-text conditioned generative model that tackles this task by retrieving the most similar 3D object mesh from a database and enforcing geometric hand-object interaction constraints via a novel inference-time diffusion guidance. We benchmark our model on the HOI4D and H2O datasets, adapting relevant baselines for this novel task. Experiments demonstrate our superior performance in the diversity and quality of generated trajectories, as well as in hand-object interaction geometry metrics.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by prevailing practices in unified model learning, we adopt an efficient training strategy that minimizes the training complexity and overhead by bridging the off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models through a set of learnable queries and a light-weight transformer-based connector. With a minimalist choice of architecture, we demonstrate that OpenUni can: 1) generate high-quality and instruction-aligned images, and 2) achieve exceptional performance on standard benchmarks such as GenEval, DPG- Bench, and WISE, with only 1.1B and 3.1B activated parameters. To support open research and community advancement, we release all model weights, training code, and our curated training datasets (including 23M image-text pairs) at https://github.com/wusize/OpenUni.</p></details> |  |

We start by designing the tokenizer that converts images into sequences of discrete tokens, where tokens in different positions can be decoded into different diffusion denoising steps in the pixel space. Thanks to the diffusion properties, these tokens naturally follow a coarse-to-fine order, which directly lends itself to autoregressive modeling. Therefore, we apply standard next-token prediction on these tokens, without modifying any underlying designs (either causal masks or training/inference strategies), and such sequential autoregressive token generation directly mirrors the diffusion procedure in image space. That is, once the autoregressive model generates an increment of tokens, we can directly decode these tokens into the corresponding diffusion denoising step in the streaming manner. Our pipeline naturally reveals several intriguing properties, for example, it supports consistent previews when generating only a subset of tokens and enables zero-shot layout-controlled synthesis. On the standard ImageNet benchmark, our method achieves 2.09 FID using a 775M Llama backbone with 256 discrete tokens. We hope our work can inspire future research on unified autoregressive architectures of visual synthesis, especially with large language models. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/showlab/D-AR</p></details> | Technical report |

However, current T2V models often struggle to generate physically plausible content due to their limited inherent ability to accurately understand physics. We found that while the representations within T2V models possess some capacity for physics understanding, they lag significantly behind those from recent video self-supervised learning methods. To this end, we propose a novel framework called VideoREPA, which distills physics understanding capability from video understanding foundation models into T2V models by aligning token-level relations. This closes the physics understanding gap and enable more physics-plausible generation. Specifically, we introduce the Token Relation Distillation (TRD) loss, leveraging spatio-temporal alignment to provide soft guidance suitable for finetuning powerful pre-trained T2V models, a critical departure from prior representation alignment (REPA) methods. To our knowledge, VideoREPA is the first REPA method designed for finetuning T2V models and specifically for injecting physical knowledge. Empirical evaluations show that VideoREPA substantially enhances the physics commonsense of baseline method, CogVideoX, achieving significant improvement on relevant benchmarks and demonstrating a strong capacity for generating videos consistent with intuitive physics. More video results are available at https://videorepa.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an alternative method that is both optimization-free and forward SDE-free. By expanding the score function in a sparse set of eigenbasis of the backward Kolmogorov operator associated with the diffusion process, we reformulate score estimation as the solution to a linear system, avoiding iterative optimization and time-dependent sample generation. We analyze the approximation error using perturbation theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on high-dimensional Boltzmann distributions and real-world datasets.</p></details> | 36 pages, 6 figures |

Current supervised deep learning approaches, while powerful, are limited by the need for extensive, task-specific labeled data and struggle to generalize to the immense variability and open-set nature of real-world acoustic scenes. Inspired by the success of generative foundation models, we investigate whether pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion models can overcome these limitations. We make a surprising discovery: zero-shot source separation can be achieved purely through a pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion model under the right configuration. Our method, named ZeroSep, works by inverting the mixed audio into the diffusion model's latent space and then using text conditioning to guide the denoising process to recover individual sources. Without any task-specific training or fine-tuning, ZeroSep repurposes the generative diffusion model for a discriminative separation task and inherently supports open-set scenarios through its rich textual priors. ZeroSep is compatible with a variety of pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion backbones and delivers strong separation performance on multiple separation benchmarks, surpassing even supervised methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wikichao.github.io/ZeroSep/</p></details> |

In our recent work, we introduced a bi-level regularization framework. This study significantly improves upon the bi-level algorithm by sequentially initializing the lower-level problem, yielding accelerated convergence and demonstrable multi-scale effect, while retaining regularizing effect and allows for the usage of inexact PDE solvers. Moreover, by collecting the lower-level trajectory, we uncover an interesting connection to the incremental load method. The sequential bi-level approach illustrates its universality through several reaction-diffusion applications, in which the nonlinear reaction law needs to be determined. We moreover prove that the proposed tangential cone condition is satisfied.</p></details> |  |

| **[Monotone Bounded-Depth Complexity of Homomorphism Polynomials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22894v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For every fixed graph $H$, it is known that homomorphism counts from $H$ and colorful $H$-subgraph counts can be determined in $O(n^{t+1})$ time on $n$-vertex input graphs $G$, where $t$ is the treewidth of $H$. On the other hand, a running time of $n^{o(t / \log t)}$ would refute the exponential-time hypothesis. Komarath, Pandey and Rahul (Algorithmica, 2023) studied algebraic variants of these counting problems, i.e., homomorphism and subgraph $\textit{polynomials}$ for fixed graphs $H$. These polynomials are weighted sums over the objects counted above, where each object is weighted by the product of variables corresponding to edges contained in the object. As shown by Komarath et al., the $\textit{monotone}$ circuit complexity of the homomorphism polynomial for $H$ is $\Theta(n^{\mathrm{tw}(H)+1})$. In this paper, we characterize the power of monotone $\textit{bounded-depth}$ circuits for homomorphism and colorful subgraph polynomials. This leads us to discover a natural hierarchy of graph parameters $\mathrm{tw}_\Delta(H)$, for fixed $\Delta \in \mathbb N$, which capture the width of tree-decompositions for $H$ when the underlying tree is required to have depth at most $\Delta$. We prove that monotone circuits of product-depth $\Delta$ computing the homomorphism polynomial for $H$ require size $\Theta(n^{\mathrm{tw}_\Delta(H^{\dagger})+1})$, where $H^{\dagger}$ is the graph obtained from $H$ by removing all degree-$1$ vertices. This allows us to derive an optimal depth hierarchy theorem for monotone bounded-depth circuits through graph-theoretic arguments.</p></details> | 22 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Improving Contrastive Learning for Referring Expression Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22850v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object counting has progressed from class-specific models, which count only known categories, to class-agnostic models that generalize to unseen categories. The next challenge is Referring Expression Counting (REC), where the goal is to count objects based on fine-grained attributes and contextual differences. Existing methods struggle with distinguishing visually similar objects that belong to the same category but correspond to different referring expressions. To address this, we propose C-REX, a novel contrastive learning framework, based on supervised contrastive learning, designed to enhance discriminative representation learning. Unlike prior works, C-REX operates entirely within the image space, avoiding the misalignment issues of image-text contrastive learning, thus providing a more stable contrastive signal. It also guarantees a significantly larger pool of negative samples, leading to improved robustness in the learned representations. Moreover, we showcase that our framework is versatile and generic enough to be applied to other similar tasks like class-agnostic counting. To support our approach, we analyze the key components of sota detection-based models and identify that detecting object centroids instead of bounding boxes is the key common factor behind their success in counting tasks. We use this insight to design a simple yet effective detection-based baseline to build upon. Our experiments show that C-REX achieves state-of-the-art results in REC, outperforming previous methods by more than 22\% in MAE and more than 10\% in RMSE, while also demonstrating strong performance in class-agnostic counting. Code is available at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/c-rex.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

However, complex disaster scenes with diverse disaster types, geographic regions, and satellite sensors have posed new challenges for VLM applications. To fill this gap, we curate a remote sensing vision-language dataset (DisasterM3) for global-scale disaster assessment and response. DisasterM3 includes 26,988 bi-temporal satellite images and 123k instruction pairs across 5 continents, with three characteristics: 1) Multi-hazard: DisasterM3 involves 36 historical disaster events with significant impacts, which are categorized into 10 common natural and man-made disasters. 2)Multi-sensor: Extreme weather during disasters often hinders optical sensor imaging, making it necessary to combine Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for post-disaster scenes. 3) Multi-task: Based on real-world scenarios, DisasterM3 includes 9 disaster-related visual perception and reasoning tasks, harnessing the full potential of VLM's reasoning ability with progressing from disaster-bearing body recognition to structural damage assessment and object relational reasoning, culminating in the generation of long-form disaster reports. We extensively evaluated 14 generic and remote sensing VLMs on our benchmark, revealing that state-of-the-art models struggle with the disaster tasks, largely due to the lack of a disaster-specific corpus, cross-sensor gap, and damage object counting insensitivity. Focusing on these issues, we fine-tune four VLMs using our dataset and achieve stable improvements across all tasks, with robust cross-sensor and cross-disaster generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>A mul...</summary><p>A multi-hazard, multi-sensor, and multi-task vision-language dataset for global-scale disaster assessment and response</p></details> |
| **[MetaSlot: Break Through the Fixed Number of Slots in Object-Centric Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20772v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning object-level, structured representations is widely regarded as a key to better generalization in vision and underpins the design of next-generation Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs). Mainstream Object-Centric Learning (OCL) methods adopt Slot Attention or its variants to iteratively aggregate objects' super-pixels into a fixed set of query feature vectors, termed slots. However, their reliance on a static slot count leads to an object being represented as multiple parts when the number of objects varies. We introduce MetaSlot, a plug-and-play Slot Attention variant that adapts to variable object counts. MetaSlot (i) maintains a codebook that holds prototypes of objects in a dataset by vector-quantizing the resulting slot representations; (ii) removes duplicate slots from the traditionally aggregated slots by quantizing them with the codebook; and (iii) injects progressively weaker noise into the Slot Attention iterations to accelerate and stabilize the aggregation. MetaSlot is a general Slot Attention variant that can be seamlessly integrated into existing OCL architectures. Across multiple public datasets and tasks--including object discovery and recognition--models equipped with MetaSlot achieve significant performance gains and markedly interpretable slot representations, compared with existing Slot Attention variants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal LLM-Guided Semantic Correction in Text-to-Image Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20053v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become the mainstream architecture for text-to-image generation, achieving remarkable progress in visual quality and prompt controllability. However, current inference pipelines generally lack interpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the denoising process. Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of the final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making them ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative trajectory. As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial errors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising prompt-image alignment and image quality. To tackle these challenges, we propose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel framework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference. PPAD performs real-time analysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic inconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that actively guide the remaining denoising steps. The framework supports both inference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction at only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPAD's significant improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expanding Zero-Shot Object Counting with Rich Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15398v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expanding pre-trained zero-shot counting models to handle unseen categories requires more than simply adding new prompts, as this approach does not achieve the necessary alignment between text and visual features for accurate counting. We introduce RichCount, the first framework to address these limitations, employing a two-stage training strategy that enhances text encoding and strengthens the model's association with objects in images. RichCount improves zero-shot counting for unseen categories through two key objectives: (1) enriching text features with a feed-forward network and adapter trained on text-image similarity, thereby creating robust, aligned representations; and (2) applying this refined encoder to counting tasks, enabling effective generalization across diverse prompts and complex images. In this manner, RichCount goes beyond simple prompt expansion to establish meaningful feature alignment that supports accurate counting across novel categories. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RichCount, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot counting and significantly enhancing generalization to unseen categories in open-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marmot: Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting in Improving Image-Text Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20054v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential approach is to utilize Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to build a self-correction framework. However, these approaches are highly dependent on the capabilities of the employed MLLM, often failing to account for all objects within the image. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that employs Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting, enhancing image-text alignment and facilitating more coherent multi-object image editing. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, decomposing the self-correction task into object-level subtasks according to three critical dimensions: counting, attributes, and spatial relationships. We construct a multi-agent self-correcting system featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To resolve the problem of subtask integration, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother that employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtask results, thereby enhancing runtime efficiency while eliminating multi-stage distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Vision Language Models Struggle with Visual Arithmetic? Towards Enhanced Chart and Geometry Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11492v3)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, yet they often struggle with visual arithmetic, seemingly simple capabilities like object counting or length comparison, which are essential for relevant complex tasks like chart understanding and geometric reasoning. In this work, we first investigate the root causes of this deficiency through a suite of probing tasks focusing on basic visual arithmetic. Our analysis reveals that while pre-trained vision encoders typically capture sufficient information, the text decoder often fails to decode it correctly for arithmetic reasoning. To address this, we propose CogAlign, a novel post-training strategy inspired by Piaget's theory of cognitive development. CogAlign trains VLMs to recognize invariant properties under visual transformations. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the performance of three diverse VLMs on our proposed probing tasks. Furthermore, CogAlign enhances performance by an average of 4.6% on CHOCOLATE and 2.9% on MATH-VISION, outperforming or matching supervised fine-tuning methods while requiring only 60% less training data. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of CogAlign in improving fundamental visual arithmetic capabilities and their transfer to downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data are available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/CogAlign</p></details> |

However, existing open-vocabulary and visual grounding methods rely on explicit category cues, limiting their ability to handle complex or implicit queries that require advanced reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce a new suite of tasks, including Instruction-Oriented Object Counting, Detection, and Segmentation (InstructCDS), covering open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass scenarios. We further present EarthInstruct, the first InstructCDS benchmark for earth observation. It is constructed from two diverse remote sensing datasets with varying spatial resolutions and annotation rules across 20 categories, necessitating models to interpret dataset-specific instructions. Given the scarcity of semantically rich labeled data in remote sensing, we propose InstructSAM, a training-free framework for instruction-driven object recognition. InstructSAM leverages large vision-language models to interpret user instructions and estimate object counts, employs SAM2 for mask proposal, and formulates mask-label assignment as a binary integer programming problem. By integrating semantic similarity with counting constraints, InstructSAM efficiently assigns categories to predicted masks without relying on confidence thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that InstructSAM matches or surpasses specialized baselines across multiple tasks while maintaining near-constant inference time regardless of object count, reducing output tokens by 89% and overall runtime by over 32% compared to direct generation approaches. We believe the contributions of the proposed tasks, benchmark, and effective approach will advance future research in developing versatile object recognition systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods rely on CNNs and Transformers, but CNNs struggle to capture global dependencies, and Transformers are computationally expensive, which limits their effectiveness in remote applications. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising solution in the field of computer vision, offering a linear complexity for modeling global dependencies. To this end, we propose Mamba-MOC, a mamba-based network designed for multi-category remote object counting, which represents the first application of Mamba to remote sensing object counting. Specifically, we propose a cross-scale interaction module to facilitate the deep integration of hierarchical features. Then we design a context state space model to capture both global and local contextual information and provide local neighborhood information during the scan process. Experimental results in large-scale realistic scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with some mainstream counting algorithms.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are constrained to basic instruction-following or descriptive tasks, facing challenges in complex real-world remote sensing applications that require specialized tools and knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose RS-Agent, an AI agent designed to interact with human users and autonomously leverage specialized models to address the demands of real-world remote sensing applications. RS-Agent integrates four key components: a Central Controller based on large language models, a dynamic toolkit for tool execution, a Solution Space for task-specific expert guidance, and a Knowledge Space for domain-level reasoning, enabling it to interpret user queries and orchestrate tools for accurate remote sensing task. We introduce two novel mechanisms: Task-Aware Retrieval, which improves tool selection accuracy through expert-guided planning, and DualRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation method that enhances knowledge relevance through weighted, dual-path retrieval. RS-Agent supports flexible integration of new tools and is compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets and 18 remote sensing tasks demonstrate that RS-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs, achieving over 95% task planning accuracy and delivering superior performance in tasks such as scene classification, object counting, and remote sensing visual question answering. Our work presents RS-Agent as a robust and extensible framework for advancing intelligent automation in remote sensing analysis.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in visual-spatial reasoning, most studies focus on standard pinhole-view images, leaving omnidirectional perception largely unexplored. In this paper, we ask: Are MLLMs ready for omnidirectional spatial reasoning? To investigate this, we introduce OSR-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed for this setting. OSR-Bench includes over 153,000 diverse question-answer pairs grounded in high-fidelity panoramic indoor scene maps. It covers key reasoning types including object counting, relative distance, and direction. We also propose a negative sampling strategy that inserts non-existent objects into prompts to evaluate hallucination and grounding robustness. For fine-grained analysis, we design a two-stage evaluation framework assessing both cognitive map generation and QA accuracy using rotation-invariant matching and a combination of rule-based and LLM-based metrics. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and leading open-source models under zero-shot settings. Results show that current models struggle with spatial reasoning in panoramic contexts, highlighting the need for more perceptually grounded MLLMs. OSR-Bench and code will be released at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/UUUserna/OSR-Bench</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take the idea of structural guidance a step further by making the observation that contemporary image generation models can directly provide a plausible fine-grained structural initialization. We propose a technique that couples this image-based structural guidance with LLM-based instance-level instructions, yielding output images that adhere to all parts of the text prompt, including object counts, instance-level attributes, and spatial relations between instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH 2025.

Recent video editing approaches primarily fall into two categories: training-required and training-free methods. While training-based methods incur high computational costs, training-free alternatives often yield suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose DAPE, a high-quality yet cost-effective two-stage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework for video editing. In the first stage, we design an efficient norm-tuning method to enhance temporal consistency in generated videos. The second stage introduces a vision-friendly adapter to improve visual quality. Additionally, we identify critical shortcomings in existing benchmarks, including limited category diversity, imbalanced object distribution, and inconsistent frame counts. To mitigate these issues, we curate a large dataset benchmark comprising 232 videos with rich annotations and 6 editing prompts, enabling objective and comprehensive evaluation of advanced methods. Extensive experiments on existing datasets (BalanceCC, LOVEU-TGVE, RAVE) and our proposed benchmark demonstrate that DAPE significantly improves temporal coherence and text-video alignment while outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose CountDiffusion, a training-free framework aiming at generating images with correct object quantity from textual descriptions. CountDiffusion consists of two stages. In the first stage, an intermediate denoising result is generated by the diffusion model to predict the final synthesized image with one-step denoising, and a counting model is used to count the number of objects in this image. In the second stage, a correction module is used to correct the object quantity by changing the attention map of the object with universal guidance. The proposed CountDiffusion can be plugged into any diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation models without further training.

While unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are commonly used for indoor farm monitoring, their deployment in greenhouses is often constrained by infrastructure limitations, sensor placement challenges, and operational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we develop a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB-D camera, a 3D LiDAR, and an IMU sensor. The UAV employs a LiDAR-inertial odometry algorithm for precise navigation in GNSS-denied environments and utilizes a 3D multi-object tracking algorithm to estimate the count and weight of cherry tomatoes. We evaluate the system using two dataset: one from a harvesting row and another from a growing row. In the harvesting-row dataset, the proposed system achieves 94.4\% counting accuracy and 87.5\% weight estimation accuracy within a 13.2-meter flight completed in 10.5 seconds. For the growing-row dataset, which consists of occluded unripened fruits, we qualitatively analyze tracking performance and highlight future research directions for improving perception in greenhouse with strong occlusions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of UAVs for efficient robotic yield estimation in commercial greenhouses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 ICRA workshop on field robotics</p></details> |

This might be partially the result of the fact that Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT), a critical training step for MLLMs, has traditionally focused on scaling data volume, but not the compositional complexity of training examples. We propose COMPACT (COMPositional Atomic-to-complex visual Capability Tuning), which generates a training dataset explicitly controlling for the compositional complexity of the training examples. The data from COMPACT allows MLLMs to train on combinations of atomic capabilities to learn complex capabilities more efficiently. Across all benchmarks, COMPACT achieves comparable performance to the LLaVA-665k VIT while using less than 10% of its data budget, and even outperforms it on several, especially those involving complex multi-capability tasks. For example, COMPACT achieves substantial 83.3% improvement on MMStar and 94.0% improvement on MM-Vet compared to the full-scale VIT on particularly complex questions that require four or more atomic capabilities. COMPACT offers a scalable, data-efficient, visual compositional tuning recipe to improve on complex visual-language tasks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |

Unlike traditional image captioning or question answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and understanding visual metaphors.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLDTracker: A Comprehensive Language Description for Visual Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23704v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>VOT remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision due to dynamic appearance changes, occlusions, and background clutter. Traditional trackers, relying primarily on visual cues, often struggle in such complex scenarios. Recent advancements in VLMs have shown promise in semantic understanding for tasks like open-vocabulary detection and image captioning, suggesting their potential for VOT. However, the direct application of VLMs to VOT is hindered by critical limitations: the absence of a rich and comprehensive textual representation that semantically captures the target object's nuances, limiting the effective use of language information; inefficient fusion mechanisms that fail to optimally integrate visual and textual features, preventing a holistic understanding of the target; and a lack of temporal modeling of the target's evolving appearance in the language domain, leading to a disconnect between the initial description and the object's subsequent visual changes. To bridge these gaps and unlock the full potential of VLMs for VOT, we propose CLDTracker, a novel Comprehensive Language Description framework for robust visual Tracking. Our tracker introduces a dual-branch architecture consisting of a textual and a visual branch. In the textual branch, we construct a rich bag of textual descriptions derived by harnessing the powerful VLMs such as CLIP and GPT-4V, enriched with semantic and contextual cues to address the lack of rich textual representation. Experiments on six standard VOT benchmarks demonstrate that CLDTracker achieves SOTA performance, validating the effectiveness of leveraging robust and temporally-adaptive vision-language representations for tracking.

Our analysis reveals that existing hallucination detection methods struggle with detailed captions. We attribute this to the increasing reliance of MLLMs on their generated text, rather than the input image, as the sequence length grows. To address this issue, we propose a multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and a benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight a limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLM's performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

To address this limitation, we propose KRCapVLM, a knowledge replay-based novel image captioning framework using vision-language model. We incorporate beam search decoding to generate more diverse and coherent captions. We also integrate attention-based modules into the image encoder to enhance feature representation. Finally, we employ training schedulers to improve stability and ensure smoother convergence during training. These proposals accelerate substantial gains in both caption quality and knowledge recognition. Our proposed model demonstrates clear improvements in both the accuracy of knowledge recognition and the overall quality of generated captions. It shows a stronger ability to generalize to previously unseen knowledge concepts, producing more informative and contextually relevant descriptions. These results indicate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the model's capacity to generate meaningful, knowledge-grounded captions across a range of scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate the adaption of Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding for document-level text generation tasks. MBR decoding makes use of a utility function to estimate the output with the highest expected utility from a set of candidate outputs. Although MBR decoding is shown to be effective in a wide range of sentence-level text generation tasks, its performance on document-level text generation tasks is limited as many of the utility functions are designed for evaluating the utility of sentences. To this end, we propose MBR-OT, a variant of MBR decoding using Wasserstein distance to compute the utility of a document using a sentence-level utility function. The experimental result shows that the performance of MBR-OT outperforms that of the standard MBR in document-level machine translation, text simplification, and dense image captioning tasks.

It is little surprise that computational methods that estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these properties for classification. Our code and data are available on GitHub (https://github.com/Artificial-Memory-Lab/imageability).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ACL 2025.

| **[Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk): Fast Human Annotation of Dense Image Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22627v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While densely annotated image captions significantly facilitate the learning of robust vision-language alignment, methodologies for systematically optimizing human annotation efforts remain underexplored. We introduce Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk), an AI-in-the-loop methodology designed to maximize the number of annotated samples and improve their comprehensiveness under fixed budget constraints (e.g., total human annotation time). The framework is built upon two key insights. First, sequential annotation reduces redundant workload compared to conventional parallel annotation, as subsequent annotators only need to annotate the ``residual'' -- the missing visual information that previous annotations have not covered. Second, humans process textual input faster by reading while outputting annotations with much higher throughput via talking; thus a multimodal interface enables optimized efficiency. We evaluate our framework from two aspects: intrinsic evaluations that assess the comprehensiveness of semantic units, obtained by parsing detailed captions into object-attribute trees and analyzing their effective connections; extrinsic evaluation measures the practical usage of the annotated captions in facilitating vision-language alignment. Experiments with eight participants show our Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk) improves annotation speed (0.42 vs. 0.30 units/sec) and retrieval performance (41.13\% vs. 40.52\%) over the parallel method.</p></details> |  |
| **[RICO: Improving Accuracy and Completeness in Image Recaptioning via Visual Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22613v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image recaptioning is widely used to generate training datasets with enhanced quality for various multimodal tasks. Existing recaptioning methods typically rely on powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance textual descriptions, but often suffer from inaccuracies due to hallucinations and incompleteness caused by missing fine-grained details. To address these limitations, we propose RICO, a novel framework that refines captions through visual reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage a text-to-image model to reconstruct a caption into a reference image, and prompt an MLLM to identify discrepancies between the original and reconstructed images to refine the caption. This process is performed iteratively, further progressively promoting the generation of more faithful and comprehensive descriptions. To mitigate the additional computational cost induced by the iterative process, we introduce RICO-Flash, which learns to generate captions like RICO using DPO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves caption accuracy and completeness, outperforms most baselines by approximately 10% on both CapsBench and CompreCap.

As such, interpreting misleading creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correlating instruction-tuning (in multimodal models) with vision-language processing (in the brain)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20029v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based language models, though not explicitly trained to mimic brain recordings, have demonstrated surprising alignment with brain activity. Progress in these models-through increased size, instruction-tuning, and multimodality-has led to better representational alignment with neural data. Recently, a new class of instruction-tuned multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have emerged, showing remarkable zero-shot capabilities in open-ended multimodal vision tasks. However, it is unknown whether MLLMs, when prompted with natural instructions, lead to better brain alignment and effectively capture instruction-specific representations. To address this, we first investigate brain alignment, i.e., measuring the degree of predictivity of neural visual activity using text output response embeddings from MLLMs as participants engage in watching natural scenes. Experiments with 10 different instructions show that MLLMs exhibit significantly better brain alignment than vision-only models and perform comparably to non-instruction-tuned multimodal models like CLIP. We also find that while these MLLMs are effective at generating high-quality responses suitable to the task-specific instructions, not all instructions are relevant for brain alignment. Further, by varying instructions, we make the MLLMs encode instruction-specific visual concepts related to the input image. This analysis shows that MLLMs effectively capture count-related and recognition-related concepts, demonstrating strong alignment with brain activity. Notably, the majority of the explained variance of the brain encoding models is shared between MLLM embeddings of image captioning and other instructions. These results suggest that enhancing MLLMs' ability to capture task-specific information could lead to better differentiation between various types of instructions, and thereby improving their precision in predicting brain responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 22 figures, The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR-2025, Singapore. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=xkgfLXZ4e0</p></details> |
| **[Can Visual Encoder Learn to See Arrows?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19944v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diagram is a visual representation of a relationship illustrated with edges (lines or arrows), which is widely used in industrial and scientific communication. Although recognizing diagrams is essential for vision language models (VLMs) to comprehend domain-specific knowledge, recent studies reveal that many VLMs fail to identify edges in images. We hypothesize that these failures stem from an over-reliance on textual and positional biases, preventing VLMs from learning explicit edge features. Based on this idea, we empirically investigate whether the image encoder in VLMs can learn edge representation through training on a diagram dataset in which edges are biased neither by textual nor positional information. To this end, we conduct contrastive learning on an artificially generated diagram--caption dataset to train an image encoder and evaluate its diagram-related features on three tasks: probing, image retrieval, and captioning. Our results show that the finetuned model outperforms pretrained CLIP in all tasks and surpasses zero-shot GPT-4o and LLaVA-Mistral in the captioning task. These findings confirm that eliminating textual and positional biases fosters accurate edge recognition in VLMs, offering a promising path for advancing diagram understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for poster presentation at the Second Workshop on Visual Concepts in CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Methods: Ophthalmic image posts and associated captions published between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2024, were collected from WeChat Official Accounts. Based on these captions, bilingual question-answer (QA) pairs in Chinese and English were generated using GPT-4o-mini. QA pairs were categorized into six subsets by question type and language: binary (Binary_CN, Binary_EN), single-choice (Single-choice_CN, Single-choice_EN), and open-ended (Open-ended_CN, Open-ended_EN). The benchmark was used to evaluate the performance of three VLMs: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct. Results: The final OphthalWeChat dataset included 3,469 images and 30,120 QA pairs across 9 ophthalmic subspecialties, 548 conditions, 29 imaging modalities, and 68 modality combinations. Gemini 2.0 Flash achieved the highest overall accuracy (0.548), outperforming GPT-4o (0.522, P < 0.001) and Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct (0.514, P < 0.001). It also led in both Chinese (0.546) and English subsets (0.550). Subset-specific performance showed Gemini 2.0 Flash excelled in Binary_CN (0.687), Single-choice_CN (0.666), and Single-choice_EN (0.646), while GPT-4o ranked highest in Binary_EN (0.717), Open-ended_CN (BLEU-1: 0.301; BERTScore: 0.382), and Open-ended_EN (BLEU-1: 0.183; BERTScore: 0.240). Conclusions: This study presents the first bilingual VQA benchmark for ophthalmology, distinguished by its real-world context and inclusion of multiple examinations per patient. The dataset reflects authentic clinical decision-making scenarios and enables quantitative evaluation of VLMs, supporting the development of accurate, specialized, and trustworthy AI systems for eye care.</p></details> |  |

However, there has been almost no research into whether the tasks (object detection, image captioning, text recognition etc.) and devices (smartphones, smart-glasses etc.) investigated by researchers align with the needs and preferences of BLV people. We identified 646 studies published in the last two and a half years that have investigated such assistive AI techniques. We analysed these papers to determine the task, device and participation by BLV individuals. We then interviewed 24 BLV people and asked for their top five AI-based applications and to rank the applications found in the literature. We found only a weak positive correlation between BLV participants' perceived importance of tasks and researchers' focus and that participants prefer conversational agent interface and head-mounted devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author's accepted version of a paper published at ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility (ASSETS '23)</p></details> |

However, such capabilities have yet to be widely applied to specialized domains like medical imaging, where diagnostic interpretation relies on subtle regional findings rather than global understanding. To mitigate this gap, we propose MedDAM, the first comprehensive framework leveraging large vision-language models for region-specific captioning in medical images. MedDAM employs medical expert-designed prompts tailored to specific imaging modalities and establishes a robust evaluation benchmark comprising a customized assessment protocol, data pre-processing pipeline, and specialized QA template library. This benchmark evaluates both MedDAM and other adaptable large vision-language models, focusing on clinical factuality through attribute-level verification tasks, thereby circumventing the absence of ground-truth region-caption pairs in medical datasets. Extensive experiments on the VinDr-CXR, LIDC-IDRI, and SkinCon datasets demonstrate MedDAM's superiority over leading peers (including GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, LLaMA-3.2 Vision, Qwen2.5-VL, GPT-4Rol, and OMG-LLaVA) in the task, revealing the importance of region-level semantic alignment in medical image understanding and establishing MedDAM as a promising foundation for clinical vision-language integration.</p></details> |  |

However, their transformative potential in medical imaging remains largely untapped due to the absence of a unified visual tokenizer -- one capable of capturing fine-grained visual structures for faithful image reconstruction and realistic image synthesis, as well as rich semantics for accurate diagnosis and image interpretation. To this end, we present MedITok, the first unified tokenizer tailored for medical images, encoding both low-level structural details and high-level clinical semantics within a unified latent space. To balance these competing objectives, we introduce a novel two-stage training framework: a visual representation alignment stage that cold-starts the tokenizer reconstruction learning with a visual semantic constraint, followed by a textual semantic representation alignment stage that infuses detailed clinical semantics into the latent space. Trained on the meticulously collected large-scale dataset with over 30 million medical images and 2 million image-caption pairs, MedITok achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than 30 datasets across 9 imaging modalities and 4 different tasks. By providing a unified token space for autoregressive modeling, MedITok supports a wide range of tasks in clinical diagnostics and generative healthcare applications.

Recently, in the multimodal domain, works have begun to directly apply RL to generate R1-like free-form reasoning for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. However, multimodal tasks share an intrinsically different nature from textual tasks, which heavily rely on the understanding of the input image to solve the problem. Therefore, such free-form reasoning faces two critical limitations in the VQA task: (1) Extended reasoning chains diffuse visual focus away from task-critical regions, degrading answer accuracy. (2) Unverifiable intermediate steps amplify policy-gradient variance and computational costs overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce SATORI ($\textbf{S}patially$ $\textbf{A}nchored$ $\textbf{T}ask$ $\textbf{O}ptimization$ with $\textbf{R}e\textbf{I}nforcement$ Learning), which decomposes VQA into three verifiable stages, including global image captioning, region localization, and answer prediction, each supplying explicit reward signals. Furthermore, we also introduce VQA-Verify, a 12k dataset annotated with answer-aligned captions and bounding-boxes to facilitate training. Experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements across seven VQA benchmarks, achieving up to $15.7\%$ improvement in accuracy in accuracy compared to the R1-like baseline. Our analysis of the attention map confirms enhanced focus on critical regions, which brings improvements in accuracy.

However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1.3 million RS images, each accompanied by two descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications.

Traditional IDC methods often rely on specialist models, which restrict their applicability across varied contexts. This paper introduces the OneDiff model, a novel generalist approach that utilizes a robust vision-language model architecture, integrating a siamese image encoder with a Visual Delta Module. This innovative configuration allows for the precise detection and articulation of fine-grained differences between image pairs. OneDiff is trained through a dual-phase strategy, encompassing Coupled Sample Training and multi-task learning across a diverse array of data types, supported by our newly developed DiffCap Dataset. This dataset merges real-world and synthetic data, enhancing the training process and bolstering the model's robustness. Extensive testing on diverse IDC benchmarks, such as Spot-the-Diff, Image-Editing-Request, and Birds-to-Words, shows that OneDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in accuracy and adaptability, achieving improvements of up to 97% CIDEr points in average. By setting a new benchmark in IDC, OneDiff paves the way for more versatile and effective applications in detecting and describing visual differences.

However, CLIP is still limited in negation understanding: the ability to recognize the absence or exclusion of a concept. Existing methods address the problem by using a large language model (LLM) to generate large-scale data of image captions containing negation for further fine-tuning CLIP. However, these methods are both time- and compute-intensive, and their evaluations are typically restricted to image-text matching tasks. To expand the horizon, we (1) introduce a training-time negation data generation pipeline such that negation captions are generated during the training stage, which only increases 2.5% extra training time, and (2) we propose the first benchmark, Neg-TtoI, for evaluating text-to-image generation models on prompts containing negation, assessing model's ability to produce semantically accurate images. We show that our proposed method, TNG-CLIP, achieves SOTA performance on diverse negation benchmarks of image-to-text matching, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Evidence-Grounded Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Attention-Based GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18221v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption. Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations, our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores $93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller and task-specific methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we view MDPs as coalgebras living in the category of analytic spaces, a very general class of measurable spaces. Note that analytic spaces were already studied in the literature on labelled Markov processes and bisimulation relations. Our results are twofold. First, we define bisimulation pseudometrics over such coalgebras using the framework of fibrations. Second, we develop a quantitative modal logic for such coalgebras and prove a quantitative form of Hennessy-Milner theorem in this new setting stating that the bisimulation pseudometric corresponds to the logical distance induced by modal formulae.</p></details> |  |

This was possible through a preliminary a posteriori explainable phase describing the numerical input data in terms of concurrent constituents with numerical payloads. This further required extending the event-based literature to design specification mining algorithms supporting concurrent constituents. Our previous and current solutions outperform state-of-the-art solutions for multivariate time series classifications, thus showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Performance for Code Generation on Noisy Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23598v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognise and solve tasks which have been obfuscated beyond recognition. Focusing on competitive programming and benchmark tasks (LeetCode and MATH), we compare performance across multiple models and obfuscation methods, such as noise and redaction. We demonstrate that all evaluated LLMs can solve tasks obfuscated to a level where the text would be unintelligible to human readers, and does not contain key pieces of instruction or context. We introduce the concept of eager pattern matching to describe this behaviour, which is not observed in tasks published after the models' knowledge cutoff date, indicating strong memorisation or overfitting to training data, rather than legitimate reasoning about the presented problem. We report empirical evidence of distinct performance decay patterns between contaminated and unseen datasets. We discuss the implications for benchmarking and evaluations of model behaviour, arguing for caution when designing experiments using standard datasets. We also propose measuring the decay of performance under obfuscation as a possible strategy for detecting dataset contamination and highlighting potential safety risks and interpretability issues for automated software systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engineering Serendipity through Recommendations of Items with Atypical Aspects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23580v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A restaurant dinner or a hotel stay may lead to memorable experiences when guests encounter unexpected aspects that also match their interests. For example, an origami-making station in the waiting area of a restaurant may be both surprising and enjoyable for a customer who is passionate about paper crafts. Similarly, an exhibit of 18th century harpsichords would be atypical for a hotel lobby and likely pique the interest of a guest who has a passion for Baroque music. Motivated by this insight, in this paper we introduce the new task of engineering serendipity through recommendations of items with atypical aspects. We describe an LLM-based system pipeline that extracts atypical aspects from item reviews, then estimates and aggregates their user-specific utility in a measure of serendipity potential that is used to rerank a list of items recommended to the user. To facilitate system development and evaluation, we introduce a dataset of Yelp reviews that are manually annotated with atypical aspects and a dataset of artificially generated user profiles, together with crowdsourced annotations of user-aspect utility values. Furthermore, we introduce a custom procedure for dynamic selection of in-context learning examples, which is shown to improve LLM-based judgments of atypicality and utility. Experimental evaluations show that serendipity-based rankings generated by the system are highly correlated with ground truth rankings for which serendipity scores are computed from manual annotations of atypical aspects and their user-dependent utility. Overall, we hope that the new recommendation task and the associated system presented in this paper catalyze further research into recommendation approaches that go beyond accuracy in their pursuit of enhanced user satisfaction. The datasets and the code are made publicly available at https://github.com/ramituncc49er/ATARS .</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages of content + references and appendix. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2311.02702</p></details> |
| **[The CASE Framework -- A New Architecture for Participatory Research and Digital Health Surveillance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23516v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the CASE framework, an open-source platform for adaptive, context-aware participatory research, and pandemic preparedness. CASE implements an event-driven architecture that enables dynamic survey workflows, allowing real-time adaptation based on participant responses, external data, temporal conditions, and evolving user states. The framework supports a broad range of research needs, from simple one-time questionnaires to complex longitudinal studies with advanced conditional logic. Built on over a decade of practical experience, CASE underwent a major architectural rework in 2024, transitioning from a microservice-based design to a streamlined monolithic architecture. This evolution significantly improved maintainability, flexibility, and accessibility to deployment, particularly for institutions with limited technical capacity. CASE has been successfully deployed across diverse domains, powering national disease surveillance platforms, supporting post-COVID cohort studies, and enabling real-time sentiment analysis during political events. These applications, involving tens of thousands of participants, demonstrate the framework's scalability, versatility, and practical value. This paper describes the foundations of CASE, details its architectural evolution, and presents lessons learned from real-world deployments. We establish CASE as a mature and reusable research infrastructure that balances sophisticated functionality with practical implementation, addressing the critical global need for sustainable and institutionally controlled data collection systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, submitted as a preprint to arXiv (no prior publication)</p></details> |

A promising approach for alleviating these limitations is to cast the development of better RL algorithms as a machine learning problem itself in a process called meta-RL. Meta-RL is most commonly studied in a problem setting where, given a distribution of tasks, the goal is to learn a policy that is capable of adapting to any new task from the task distribution with as little data as possible. In this survey, we describe the meta-RL problem setting in detail as well as its major variations. We discuss how, at a high level, meta-RL research can be clustered based on the presence of a task distribution and the learning budget available for each individual task. Using these clusters, we then survey meta-RL algorithms and applications. We conclude by presenting the open problems on the path to making meta-RL part of the standard toolbox for a deep RL practitioner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning as "A Tutorial on Meta-Reinforcement Learning".

However, their limited battery life significantly restricts their use in long-duration missions. This paper presents a novel tethered marsupial robotic system composed of a UAV and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), specifically designed for autonomous, long-duration inspection tasks in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. The system extends the UAV's operational time by supplying power through a tether connected to high-capacity battery packs carried by the UGV. We detail the hardware architecture based on off-the-shelf components to ensure replicability and describe our full-stack software framework, which is composed of open-source components and built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS). The proposed software architecture enables precise localization using a Direct LiDAR Localization (DLL) method and ensures safe path planning and coordinated trajectory tracking for the integrated UGV-tether-UAV system. We validate the system through three field experiments: (1) a manual flight endurance test to estimate the operational duration, (2) an autonomous navigation test, and (3) an inspection mission to demonstrate autonomous inspection capabilities. Experimental results confirm the robustness and autonomy of the system, its capacity to operate in GNSS-denied environments, and its potential for long-endurance, autonomous inspection and monitoring tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables, 1 algorithm.

| **[Sketch Down the FLOPs: Towards Efficient Networks for Human Sketch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23763v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As sketch research has collectively matured over time, its adaptation for at-mass commercialisation emerges on the immediate horizon. Despite an already mature research endeavour for photos, there is no research on the efficient inference specifically designed for sketch data. In this paper, we first demonstrate existing state-of-the-art efficient light-weight models designed for photos do not work on sketches. We then propose two sketch-specific components which work in a plug-n-play manner on any photo efficient network to adapt them to work on sketch data. We specifically chose fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) as a demonstrator as the most recognised sketch problem with immediate commercial value. Technically speaking, we first propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation network to transfer existing photo efficient networks to be compatible with sketch, which brings down number of FLOPs and model parameters by 97.96% percent and 84.89% respectively. We then exploit the abstract trait of sketch to introduce a RL-based canvas selector that dynamically adjusts to the abstraction level which further cuts down number of FLOPs by two thirds. The end result is an overall reduction of 99.37% of FLOPs (from 40.18G to 0.254G) when compared with a full network, while retaining the accuracy (33.03% vs 32.77%) -- finally making an efficient network for the sparse sketch data that exhibit even fewer FLOPs than the best photo counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025, Project Page: https://subhajitmaity.me/SketchDownTheFLOPs</p></details> |
| **[OpenUni: A Simple Baseline for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23661v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this report, we present OpenUni, a simple, lightweight, and fully open-source baseline for unifying multimodal understanding and generation. Inspired by prevailing practices in unified model learning, we adopt an efficient training strategy that minimizes the training complexity and overhead by bridging the off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models through a set of learnable queries and a light-weight transformer-based connector. With a minimalist choice of architecture, we demonstrate that OpenUni can: 1) generate high-quality and instruction-aligned images, and 2) achieve exceptional performance on standard benchmarks such as GenEval, DPG- Bench, and WISE, with only 1.1B and 3.1B activated parameters. To support open research and community advancement, we release all model weights, training code, and our curated training datasets (including 23M image-text pairs) at https://github.com/wusize/OpenUni.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Effective Training Framework for Light-Weight Automatic Speech Recognition Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16991v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancement in deep learning encouraged developing large automatic speech recognition (ASR) models that achieve promising results while ignoring computational and memory constraints. However, deploying such models on low resource devices is impractical despite of their favorable performance. Existing approaches (pruning, distillation, layer skip etc.) transform the large models into smaller ones at the cost of significant performance degradation or require prolonged training of smaller models for better performance. To address these issues, we introduce an efficacious two-step representation learning based approach capable of producing several small sized models from a single large model ensuring considerably better performance in limited number of epochs. Comprehensive experimentation on ASR benchmarks reveals the efficacy of our approach, achieving three-fold training speed-up and up to 12.54% word error rate improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at InterSpeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Subscedastic weighted least squares estimates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00753v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the heteroscedastic linear model, the weighted least squares (WLS) estimate of the model coefficients is more efficient than the ordinary least squares (OLS) esti- mate. However, the practical application of WLS is challenging because it requires knowledge of the error variances. Feasible weighted least squares (FLS) estimates, which use approximations of the variances when they are unknown, may either be more or less efficient than the OLS estimate depending on the quality of the approx- imation. A direct comparison between FLS and OLS has significant implications for the application of regression analysis in varied fields, yet such a comparison remains an unresolved challenge. In this study, we address this challenge by identifying the conditions under which FLS estimates using fixed weights demonstrate greater effi- ciency than the OLS estimate. These conditions provide guidance for the design of feasible estimates using random weights. They also shed light on how certain robust regression estimates behave with respect to the linear model with normal errors of unequal variance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Privacy Information Annotation in Large Language Model Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20910v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Users interacting with large language models (LLMs) under their real identifiers often unknowingly risk disclosing private information. Automatically notifying users whether their queries leak privacy and which phrases leak what private information has therefore become a practical need. Existing privacy detection methods, however, were designed for different objectives and application scenarios, typically tagging personally identifiable information (PII) in anonymous content. In this work, to support the development and evaluation of privacy detection models for LLM interactions that are deployable on local user devices, we construct a large-scale multilingual dataset with 249K user queries and 154K annotated privacy phrases. In particular, we build an automated privacy annotation pipeline with cloud-based strong LLMs to automatically extract privacy phrases from dialogue datasets and annotate leaked information. We also design evaluation metrics at the levels of privacy leakage, extracted privacy phrase, and privacy information. We further establish baseline methods using light-weight LLMs with both tuning-free and tuning-based methods, and report a comprehensive evaluation of their performance. Evaluation results reveal a gap between current performance and the requirements of real-world LLM applications, motivating future research into more effective local privacy detection methods grounded in our dataset.</p></details> | 9 content pages |
| **[Adaptive Backtracking Line Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13150v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backtracking line search is foundational in numerical optimization. The basic idea is to adjust the step-size of an algorithm by a constant factor until some chosen criterion (e.g. Armijo, Descent Lemma) is satisfied. We propose a novel way to adjust step-sizes, replacing the constant factor used in regular backtracking with one that takes into account the degree to which the chosen criterion is violated, with no additional computational burden. This light-weight adjustment leads to significantly faster optimization, which we confirm by performing a variety of experiments on over fifteen real world datasets. For convex problems, we prove adaptive backtracking requires no more adjustments to produce a feasible step-size than regular backtracking does. For nonconvex smooth problems, we prove adaptive backtracking enjoys the same guarantees of regular backtracking. Furthermore, we prove adaptive backtracking preserves the convergence rates of gradient descent and its accelerated variant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pangu Light: Weight Re-Initialization for Pruning and Accelerating LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20155v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art capabilities across numerous tasks, but their immense size and inference costs pose significant computational challenges for practical deployment. While structured pruning offers a promising avenue for model compression, existing methods often struggle with the detrimental effects of aggressive, simultaneous width and depth reductions, leading to substantial performance degradation. This paper argues that a critical, often overlooked, aspect in making such aggressive joint pruning viable is the strategic re-initialization and adjustment of remaining weights to improve the model post-pruning training accuracies. We introduce Pangu Light, a framework for LLM acceleration centered around structured pruning coupled with novel weight re-initialization techniques designed to address this ``missing piece''. Our framework systematically targets multiple axes, including model width, depth, attention heads, and RMSNorm, with its effectiveness rooted in novel re-initialization methods like Cross-Layer Attention Pruning (CLAP) and Stabilized LayerNorm Pruning (SLNP) that mitigate performance drops by providing the network a better training starting point. Further enhancing efficiency, Pangu Light incorporates specialized optimizations such as absorbing Post-RMSNorm computations and tailors its strategies to Ascend NPU characteristics. The Pangu Light models consistently exhibit a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off, outperforming prominent baseline pruning methods like Nemotron and established LLMs like Qwen3 series. For instance, on Ascend NPUs, Pangu Light-32B's 81.6 average score and 2585 tokens/s throughput exceed Qwen3-32B's 80.9 average score and 2225 tokens/s.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLOT: Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12392v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose SLOT (Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time), a novel and parameter-efficient test-time inference approach that enhances a language model's ability to more accurately respond to individual prompts. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex instructions, leading to poor performances on those not well represented among general samples. To address this, SLOT conducts few optimization steps at test-time to update a light-weight sample-specific parameter vector. It is added to the final hidden layer before the output head, and enables efficient adaptation by caching the last layer features during per-sample optimization. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss on the input prompt only, SLOT helps the model better aligned with and follow each given instruction. In experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms the compared models across multiple benchmarks and LLMs. For example, Qwen2.5-7B with SLOT achieves an accuracy gain of 8.6% on GSM8K from 57.54% to 66.19%, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B with SLOT achieves a SOTA accuracy of 68.69% on GPQA among 70B-level models.

| **[Planning without Search: Refining Frontier LLMs with Offline Goal-Conditioned RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18098v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks like question answering and dialogue, but complex tasks requiring interaction, such as negotiation and persuasion, require additional long-horizon reasoning and planning. Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning can enable such planning in principle, but suffers from drawbacks that hinder scalability. In particular, multi-turn RL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated when training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the APIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to improve the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather than RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses goal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that scales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task will unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple possible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively. In addition, these value functions are trained over reasoning steps rather than full actions, to be a concise and light-weight module that facilitates decision-making in multi-turn interactions. We validate our method on tasks requiring interaction, including tool use, social deduction, and dialogue, demonstrating superior performance over both RL fine-tuning and prompting methods while maintaining efficiency and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Standard fusion layers either preserve robustness or calibration but never both. We introduce Adaptive Entropy-Gated Contrastive Fusion (AECF), a single light-weight layer that (i) adapts its entropy coefficient per instance, (ii) enforces monotone calibration across all modality subsets, and (iii) drives a curriculum mask directly from training-time entropy. On AV-MNIST and MS-COCO, AECF improves masked-input mAP by +18 pp at a 50% drop rate while reducing ECE by up to 200%, yet adds 1% run-time. All back-bones remain frozen, making AECF an easy drop-in layer for robust, calibrated multimodal inference.</p></details> |  |

While advancements in large language models (LLMs) and embodied intelligence make this goal closer, several challenges persist: the lack of a unified benchmark for more complex robot tasks, limited evaluation methods and metrics, data incompatibility between LLMs and mobile manipulation trajectories. To address these issues, we propose Embodied Mobile Manipulation in Open Environments (EMMOE), a benchmark that requires agents to interpret user instructions and execute long-horizon everyday tasks in continuous space. EMMOE seamlessly integrates high-level and low-level embodied tasks into a unified framework, along with three new metrics for more diverse assessment. Additionally, we collect~\dataset, which features in various task attributes, detailed process annotations, re-plans after failures, and two sub-datasets for LLM training. Furthermore, we design~\model, a sophisticated agent system consists of LLM with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), light weighted navigation and manipulation models, and multiple error detection mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate~\model's performance and evaluations of different models and policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Partitioning of GPU Power among Multi-Instances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17752v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient power management in cloud data centers is essential for reducing costs, enhancing performance, and minimizing environmental impact. GPUs, critical for tasks like machine learning (ML) and GenAI, are major contributors to power consumption. NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology improves GPU utilization by enabling isolated partitions with per-partition resource tracking, facilitating GPU sharing by multiple tenants. However, accurately apportioning GPU power consumption among MIG instances remains challenging due to a lack of hardware support. This paper addresses this challenge by developing software methods to estimate power usage per MIG partition. We analyze NVIDIA GPU utilization metrics and find that light-weight methods with good accuracy can be difficult to construct. We hence explore the use of ML-based power models to enable accurate, partition-level power estimation. Our findings reveal that a single generic offline power model or modeling method is not applicable across diverse workloads, especially with concurrent MIG usage, and that online models constructed using partition-level utilization metrics of workloads under execution can significantly improve accuracy. Using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we demonstrate this approach for accurate partition-level power estimation for workloads including matrix multiplication and Large Language Model inference, contributing to transparent and fair carbon reporting.</p></details> |  |

However, their heavy computation costs and model sizes are usually unacceptable in real-world deployment. Model quantization, an effective weight-lighting technique, has become an indispensable procedure in the whole deployment pipeline. The essence of quantization acceleration is the conversion from continuous floating-point numbers to discrete integer ones, which significantly speeds up the memory I/O and calculation, i.e., addition and multiplication. However, performance degradation also comes with the conversion because of the loss of precision. Therefore, it has become increasingly popular and critical to investigate how to perform the conversion and how to compensate for the information loss. This article surveys the recent five-year progress towards low-bit quantization on DNNs. We discuss and compare the state-of-the-art quantization methods and classify them into 8 main categories and 24 sub-categories according to their core techniques. Furthermore, we shed light on the potential research opportunities in the field of model quantization.

RINS is a particular form of recursive depth that significantly outperforms +55 other variants, including the recent "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM (Liu et al., 2024) and latent recurrent thinking (Geiping et al., 2025). Unlike prior works, we carry out our comparisons on a compute-matched regime, and demonstrate that for a fixed model size and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. More importantly, with light-weight (linear) adapters (comprising <1% of model parameters) and stochastic dropout, RINS offers a no-regret strategy, meaning that RINS-enabled pretraining improves performance in language modeling even when recursive depth is not applied at inference time. This corresponds to improving performance on a training compute-, parameter-, and inference-matched regime, suggesting its potential as a viable component of LLM pretraining!</p></details> |  |

Still, existing deep learning-based methods often require significant computational costs to generate diverse stylized results. Motivated by this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based framework for arbitrary style transfer RLMiniStyler. This framework leverages a unified reinforcement learning policy to iteratively guide the style transfer process by exploring and exploiting stylization feedback, generating smooth sequences of stylized results while achieving model lightweight. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty-aware multi-task learning strategy that automatically adjusts loss weights to adapt to the content and style balance requirements at different training stages, thereby accelerating model convergence. Through a series of experiments across image various resolutions, we have validated the advantages of RLMiniStyler over other state-of-the-art methods in generating high-quality, diverse artistic image sequences at a lower cost.

We utilize a publicly available dataset containing MRI images categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Our primary objective is to build a light weight deep learning model that can automatically classify brain tumor types with high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we incorporate image preprocessing steps, including normalization, data augmentation, and a cropping technique designed to reduce background noise and emphasize relevant regions. The CNN architecture is optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner, enabling systematic exploration of network parameters. To ensure reliable evaluation, we apply 5-fold cross-validation, where each hyperparameter configuration is evaluated across multiple data splits to mitigate overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.78%, indicating its potential as a diagnostic aid in clinical settings. The proposed method offers a low-complexity yet effective solution for assisting in early brain tumor diagnosis.</p></details> | 6 pages |

| **[Buffer-free Class-Incremental Learning with Out-of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23412v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) poses significant challenges in open-world scenarios, where models must not only learn new classes over time without forgetting previous ones but also handle inputs from unknown classes that a closed-set model would misclassify. Recent works address both issues by (i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework, and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets support our findings, offering new insights into the design of efficient and privacy-preserving CIL systems for open-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[IRS: Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22855v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is rapidly emerging as a key focus in computer vision, aiming to develop AI systems capable of continuous improvement, thereby enhancing their value and practicality in diverse real-world applications. In healthcare, continual learning holds great promise for continuously acquired digital pathology data, which is collected in hospitals on a daily basis. However, panoramic segmentation on digital whole slide images (WSIs) presents significant challenges, as it is often infeasible to obtain comprehensive annotations for all potential objects, spanning from coarse structures (e.g., regions and unit objects) to fine structures (e.g., cells). This results in temporally and partially annotated data, posing a major challenge in developing a holistic segmentation framework. Moreover, an ideal segmentation model should incorporate new phenotypes, unseen diseases, and diverse populations, making this task even more complex. In this paper, we introduce a novel and unified Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation (IRS) learning scheme to address temporally acquired, partially annotated data while maintaining out-of-distribution (OOD) continual learning capacity in digital pathology. The key innovation of IRS lies in its ability to realize a new spatial-temporal OOD continual learning paradigm by mathematically modeling anatomical relationships between existing and newly introduced classes through a simple incremental universal proposition matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that the IRS method effectively handles the multi-scale nature of pathological segmentation, enabling precise kidney segmentation across various structures (regions, units, and cells) as well as OOD disease lesions at multiple magnifications. This capability significantly enhances domain generalization, making IRS a robust approach for real-world digital pathology applications.</p></details> |  |

This problem poses two challenges, the interference of similar source-class knowledge in target-class representation learning and the shocks of new target knowledge to old ones. To address them, we propose the Multi-Granularity Class Prototype Topology Distillation (GROTO) algorithm, which effectively transfers the source knowledge to the class-incremental target domain. Concretely, we design the multi-granularity class prototype self-organization module and the prototype topology distillation module. First, we mine the positive classes by modeling accumulation distributions. Next, we introduce multi-granularity class prototypes to generate reliable pseudo-labels, and exploit them to promote the positive-class target feature self-organization. Second, the positive-class prototypes are leveraged to construct the topological structures of source and target feature spaces. Then, we perform the topology distillation to continually mitigate the shocks of new target knowledge to old ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets.

Most gesture recognition efforts focus on close-set scenarios, thereby limiting the capacity to effectively handle unseen or novel gestures. We aim to address class-incremental gesture recognition, which entails the ability to accommodate new and previously unseen gestures over time. Specifically, we introduce a Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay (PGPFR) framework for data-free class-incremental gesture recognition. This framework comprises four components: Pseudo Feature Generation with Batch Prototypes (PFGBP), Variational Prototype Replay (VPR) for old classes, Truncated Cross-Entropy (TCE) for new classes, and Continual Classifier Re-Training (CCRT). To tackle the issue of catastrophic forgetting, the PFGBP dynamically generates a diversity of pseudo features in an online manner, leveraging class prototypes of old classes along with batch class prototypes of new classes. Furthermore, the VPR enforces consistency between the classifier's weights and the prototypes of old classes, leveraging class prototypes and covariance matrices to enhance robustness and generalization capabilities. The TCE mitigates the impact of domain differences of the classifier caused by pseudo features. Finally, the CCRT training strategy is designed to prevent overfitting to new classes and ensure the stability of features extracted from old classes. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used gesture recognition datasets, namely SHREC 2017 3D and EgoGesture 3D, demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 11.8\% and 12.8\% in terms of mean global accuracy, respectively.

| **[Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning For Efficient SAR Automatic Target Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19565v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems have rapidly evolved to tackle incremental recognition challenges in operational settings. Data scarcity remains a major hurdle that conventional SAR-ATR techniques struggle to address. To cope with this challenge, we propose a few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) framework based on a dual-branch architecture that focuses on local feature extraction and leverages the discrete Fourier transform and global filters to capture long-term spatial dependencies. This incorporates a lightweight cross-attention mechanism that fuses domain-specific features with global dependencies to ensure robust feature interaction, while maintaining computational efficiency by introducing minimal scale-shift parameters. The framework combines focal loss for class distinction under imbalance and center loss for compact intra-class distributions to enhance class separation boundaries. Experimental results on the MSTAR benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in FSCIL SAR-ATR, attesting to its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Class-Incremental Learning with Hierarchical Generative Prototypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02447v4)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) aims at unburdening the training of deep models by distributing computation across multiple devices (clients) while safeguarding data privacy. On top of that, Federated Continual Learning (FCL) also accounts for data distribution evolving over time, mirroring the dynamic nature of real-world environments. While previous studies have identified Catastrophic Forgetting and Client Drift as primary causes of performance degradation in FCL, we shed light on the importance of Incremental Bias and Federated Bias, which cause models to prioritize classes that are recently introduced or locally predominant, respectively. Our proposal constrains both biases in the last layer by efficiently finetuning a pre-trained backbone using learnable prompts, resulting in clients that produce less biased representations and more biased classifiers. Therefore, instead of solely relying on parameter aggregation, we leverage generative prototypes to effectively balance the predictions of the global model. Our method significantly improves the current State Of The Art, providing an average increase of +7.8% in accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[REAL: Representation Enhanced Analytic Learning for Exemplar-free Class-incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13522v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exemplar-free class-incremental learning (EFCIL) aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning (CIL) without available historical training samples as exemplars. Compared with its exemplar-based CIL counterpart that stores exemplars, EFCIL suffers more from forgetting issues. Recently, a new EFCIL branch named Analytic Continual Learning (ACL) introduces a gradient-free paradigm via Recursive Least-Square, achieving a forgetting-resistant classifier training with a frozen backbone during CIL. However, existing ACL suffers from ineffective representations and insufficient utilization of backbone knowledge. In this paper, we propose a representation-enhanced analytic learning (REAL) to address these problems. To enhance the representation, REAL constructs a dual-stream base pretraining followed by representation enhancing distillation process. The dual-stream base pretraining combines self-supervised contrastive learning for general features and supervised learning for class-specific knowledge, followed by the representation enhancing distillation to merge both streams, enhancing representations for subsequent CIL paradigm. To utilize more knowledge from the backbone, REAL presents a feature fusion buffer to multi-layer backbone features, providing informative features for the subsequent classifier training. Our method can be incorporated into existing ACL techniques and provides more competitive performance. Empirical results demonstrate that, REAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks, outperforming exemplar-free methods and rivaling exemplar-based approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Fair Class-Incremental Learning using Sample Weighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01324v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model fairness is becoming important in class-incremental learning for Trustworthy AI. While accuracy has been a central focus in class-incremental learning, fairness has been relatively understudied. However, naively using all the samples of the current task for training results in unfair catastrophic forgetting for certain sensitive groups including classes. We theoretically analyze that forgetting occurs if the average gradient vector of the current task data is in an "opposite direction" compared to the average gradient vector of a sensitive group, which means their inner products are negative. We then propose a fair class-incremental learning framework that adjusts the training weights of current task samples to change the direction of the average gradient vector and thus reduce the forgetting of underperforming groups and achieve fairness. For various group fairness measures, we formulate optimization problems to minimize the overall losses of sensitive groups while minimizing the disparities among them. We also show the problems can be solved with linear programming and propose an efficient Fairness-aware Sample Weighting (FSW) algorithm. Experiments show that FSW achieves better accuracy-fairness tradeoff results than state-of-the-art approaches on real datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory Is Not the Bottleneck: Cost-Efficient Continual Learning via Weight Space Consolidation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07274v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) has traditionally emphasized minimizing exemplar memory usage, assuming that memory is the primary bottleneck. However, in modern computing environments-particularly those involving large foundation models-memory is inexpensive and abundant, while GPU time constitutes the main cost. This paper re-examines CL under a more realistic setting with sufficient exemplar memory, where the system can retain a representative portion of past data. We find that, under this regime, stability improves due to reduced forgetting, but plasticity diminishes as the model becomes biased toward prior tasks and struggles to adapt to new ones. Notably, even simple baselines like naive replay can match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost. Building on this insight, we propose a lightweight yet effective method called Weight Space Consolidation, which directly operates in the model's weight space via two core mechanisms: (1) rank-based parameter resets to recover plasticity, and (2) weight averaging to enhance stability. Our approach outperforms strong baselines across class-incremental learning with image classifiers and continual instruction tuning with large language models, while requiring only one-third to one-fourth of the training cost. These findings challenge long-standing CL assumptions and establish a new, cost-efficient baseline for real-world continual learning systems where exemplar memory is no longer the limiting factor.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Recent work on audio deepfake source tracing (ST) aims to find the origins of synthetic or manipulated speech. However, ST models must adapt to learn new deepfake attacks while retaining knowledge of the previous ones. A major challenge is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose the ability to recognize previously learned attacks. Some continual learning methods help with deepfake detection, but multi-class tasks such as ST introduce additional challenges as the number of classes grows. To address this, we propose an analytic class incremental learning method called AnaST. When new attacks appear, the feature extractor remains fixed, and the classifier is updated with a closed-form analytical solution in one epoch. This approach ensures data privacy, optimizes memory usage, and is suitable for online training. The experiments carried out in this work show that our method outperforms the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Consolidation of Top-Down Modulations Achieves Sparsely Supervised Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14125v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological brains learn continually from a stream of unlabeled data, while integrating specialized information from sparsely labeled examples without compromising their ability to generalize. Meanwhile, machine learning methods are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in this natural learning setting, as supervised specialist fine-tuning degrades performance on the original task. We introduce task-modulated contrastive learning (TMCL), which takes inspiration from the biophysical machinery in the neocortex, using predictive coding principles to integrate top-down information continually and without supervision. We follow the idea that these principles build a view-invariant representation space, and that this can be implemented using a contrastive loss. Then, whenever labeled samples of a new class occur, new affine modulations are learned that improve separation of the new class from all others, without affecting feedforward weights. By co-opting the view-invariance learning mechanism, we then train feedforward weights to match the unmodulated representation of a data sample to its modulated counterparts. This introduces modulation invariance into the representation space, and, by also using past modulations, stabilizes it. Our experiments show improvements in both class-incremental and transfer learning over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, as well as over comparable supervised approaches, using as few as 1% of available labels. Taken together, our work suggests that top-down modulations play a crucial role in balancing stability and plasticity.</p></details> | 33 pages, 5 figures |
| **[StPR: Spatiotemporal Preservation and Routing for Exemplar-Free Video Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13997v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Class-Incremental Learning (VCIL) seeks to develop models that continuously learn new action categories over time without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Unlike traditional Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), VCIL introduces the added complexity of spatiotemporal structures, making it particularly challenging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while effectively capturing both frame-shared semantics and temporal dynamics. Existing approaches either rely on exemplar rehearsal, raising concerns over memory and privacy, or adapt static image-based methods that neglect temporal modeling. To address these limitations, we propose Spatiotemporal Preservation and Routing (StPR), a unified and exemplar-free VCIL framework that explicitly disentangles and preserves spatiotemporal information. First, we introduce Frame-Shared Semantics Distillation (FSSD), which identifies semantically stable and meaningful channels by jointly considering semantic sensitivity and classification contribution. These important semantic channels are selectively regularized to maintain prior knowledge while allowing for adaptation. Second, we design a Temporal Decomposition-based Mixture-of-Experts (TD-MoE), which dynamically routes task-specific experts based on their temporal dynamics, enabling inference without task ID or stored exemplars. Together, StPR effectively leverages spatial semantics and temporal dynamics, achieving a unified, exemplar-free VCIL framework. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics400 show that our method outperforms existing baselines while offering improved interpretability and efficiency in VCIL.

| **[Efficient Federated Class-Incremental Learning of Pre-Trained Models via Task-agnostic Low-rank Residual Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12318v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) reduces communication and computation costs in federated fine-tuning of pre-trained models by updating only a small subset of model parameters. However, existing approaches assume static data distributions, failing to adequately address real-world scenarios where new classes continually emerge, particularly in Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL). FCIL faces two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation caused by non-IID data across clients. Unlike current methods that maintain separate task-specific components or suffer from aggregation noise during parameter aggregation, we propose Federated Task-agnostic Low-rank Residual Adaptation (Fed-TaLoRA), a novel parameter-efficient approach for fine-tuning in resource-constrained FCIL scenarios. Specifically, we fine-tune only shared task-agnostic LoRA parameters across sequential tasks, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting while enabling efficient knowledge transfer among clients. Based on a theoretical analysis of aggregation, we develop a novel residual weight update mechanism that ensures accurate knowledge consolidation with minimal overhead. Our methodological innovations are attributed to three key strategies: task-agnostic adaptation, post-aggregation model calibration, and strategic placement of LoRA modules. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Fed-TaLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse data heterogeneity scenarios while substantially reducing resource requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Shift Estimation via Dual-Projection and Classifier Reconstruction for Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05423v4)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to sequentially learn from distinct categories without retaining exemplars but easily suffers from catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. While existing EFCIL methods leverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two critical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the embeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks, and the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with new data, hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate a classifier reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits previous in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, on various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods.

Existing methods typically rely on correlation-based strategies, where an image's classification feature is used as a query to retrieve the most related key prompts and select the corresponding value prompts for training. However, these approaches face an inherent limitation: fitting the entire feature space of all tasks with only a few trainable prompts is fundamentally challenging. We propose Predictive Prompting (PrePrompt), a novel CIL framework that circumvents correlation-based limitations by leveraging pre-trained models' natural classification ability to predict task-specific prompts. Specifically, PrePrompt decomposes CIL into a two-stage prediction framework: task-specific prompt prediction followed by label prediction. While theoretically appealing, this framework risks bias toward recent classes due to missing historical data for older classifier calibration. PrePrompt then mitigates this by incorporating feature translation, dynamically balancing stability and plasticity. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate PrePrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art prompt-based CIL methods.

However, a major problem is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose their ability to recognize earlier keywords. Although several continual learning methods have proven their usefulness for reducing forgetting, most existing approaches depend on storing and revisiting old data to combat catastrophic forgetting. Though effective, these methods face two practical challenges: 1) privacy risks from keeping user data and 2) large memory and time consumption that limit deployment on small devices. To address these issues, we propose an exemplar-free Analytic Continual Learning (AnalyticKWS) method that updates model parameters without revisiting earlier data. Inspired by efficient learning principles, AnalyticKWS computes a closed-form analytical solution for model updates and requires only a single epoch of adaptation for incoming keywords. AnalyticKWS demands fewer computational resources by avoiding gradient-based updates and does not store old data. By eliminating the need for back-propagation during incremental learning, the model remains lightweight and efficient. As a result, AnalyticKWS meets the challenges mentioned earlier and suits resource-limited settings well. Extensive experiments on various datasets and settings show that AnalyticKWS consistently outperforms existing continual learning methods.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

Current exemplar replay strategies impose $\mathcal{O}(t)$ memory/compute complexities. We propose an autoencoder-based hybrid replay (AHR) strategy that leverages our new hybrid autoencoder (HAE) to function as a compressor to alleviate the requirement for large memory, achieving $\mathcal{O}(0.1 t)$ at the worst case with the computing complexity of $\mathcal{O}(t)$ while accomplishing state-of-the-art performance. The decoder later recovers the exemplar data stored in the latent space, rather than in raw format. Additionally, HAE is designed for both discriminative and generative modeling, enabling classification and replay capabilities, respectively. HAE adopts the charged particle system energy minimization equations and repulsive force algorithm for the incremental embedding and distribution of new class centroids in its latent space. Our results demonstrate that AHR consistently outperforms recent baselines across multiple benchmarks while operating with the same memory/compute budgets. The source code is included in the supplementary material and will be open-sourced upon publication.</p></details> | Accepted ICML 2025 |

Existing CSSL methods, while learning new tasks, focus on preventing catastrophic forgetting. To this end, most of them use regularization strategies to retain knowledge of previous tasks. This reduces the model's ability to adapt to the data of new tasks (i.e., learning plasticity), which can degrade performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel CSSL method that aims to learn tasks sequentially, while achieving high learning plasticity. To this end, the proposed method uses a knowledge distillation strategy with an integrated decoupling mechanism. The decoupling is achieved by first dividing the feature dimensions into task-common and task-specific parts. Then, the task-common features are forced to be correlated to ensure memory stability while the task-specific features are forced to be de-correlated facilitating the learning of new features. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to CaSSLe, which is a widely used CSSL framework, with improvements of up to 1.12% in average accuracy and 2.33% in intransigence in a task-incremental scenario, and 1.24% in average accuracy and 2.01% in intransigence in a class-incremental scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>We fo...</summary><p>We found the reported results of the compared method to be misleading</p></details> |

While class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) is crucial for handling diverse and newly emerging objects in the real world, traditional CISS methods require expensive pixel-level annotations for training. To overcome this limitation, partially weakly-supervised approaches have recently been proposed. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a completely weakly-supervised method for CISS. To achieve this, we propose to generate robust pseudo-labels by combining pseudo-labels from a localizer and a sequence of foundation models based on their uncertainty. Moreover, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce an exemplar-guided data augmentation method that generates diverse images containing both previous and novel classes with guidance. Finally, we conduct experiments in three common experimental settings: 15-5 VOC, 10-10 VOC, and COCO-to-VOC, and in two scenarios: disjoint and overlap. The experimental results demonstrate that our completely weakly supervised method outperforms even partially weakly supervised methods in the 15-5 VOC and 10-10 VOC settings while achieving competitive accuracy in the COCO-to-VOC setting.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Recent work has shown that deep linear networks tend to be resilient towards loss of plasticity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Adaptive Linearization (AdaLin), a general approach that dynamically adapts each neuron's activation function to mitigate plasticity loss. Unlike prior methods that rely on regularization or periodic resets, AdaLin equips every neuron with a learnable parameter and a gating mechanism that injects linearity into the activation function based on its gradient flow. This adaptive modulation ensures sufficient gradient signal and sustains continual learning without introducing additional hyperparameters or requiring explicit task boundaries. When used with conventional activation functions like ReLU, Tanh, and GeLU, we demonstrate that AdaLin can significantly improve performance on standard benchmarks, including Random Label and Permuted MNIST, Random Label and Shuffled CIFAR-10, and Class-Split CIFAR-100. Furthermore, its efficacy is shown in more complex scenarios, such as class-incremental learning on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-18 backbone, and in mitigating plasticity loss in off-policy reinforcement learning agents. We perform a systematic set of ablations that show that neuron-level adaptation is crucial for good performance and analyze a number of metrics in the network that might be correlated to loss of plasticity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 4th Conference on Lifelong Learning Agents (CoLLAs), 2025</p></details> |
