| **[MoDyGAN: Combining Molecular Dynamics With GANs to Investigate Protein Conformational Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13950v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensively exploring protein conformational landscapes remains a major challenge in computational biology due to the high computational cost involved in dynamic physics-based simulations. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational spaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into MD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble learning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of generated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative representation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into 2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use three rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new conformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that interpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that representing proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying advanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an efficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed framework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Stage Pretraining for Molecular Property Prediction in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03537v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in property prediction, but they often require large amounts of labeled data. The challenge is that, in real-world applications, labels are extremely scarce, as obtaining them through laboratory experimentation is both expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we introduce MoleVers, a versatile pretrained molecular model designed for various types of molecular property prediction in the wild, i.e., where experimentally-validated labels are scarce. MoleVers employs a two-stage pretraining strategy. In the first stage, it learns molecular representations from unlabeled data through masked atom prediction and extreme denoising, a novel task enabled by our newly introduced branching encoder architecture and dynamic noise scale sampling. In the second stage, the model refines these representations through predictions of auxiliary properties derived from computational methods, such as the density functional theory or large language models. Evaluation on 22 small, experimentally-validated datasets demonstrates that MoleVers achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of its two-stage framework in producing generalizable molecular representations for diverse downstream properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[On-the-Fly Fine-Tuning of Foundational Neural Network Potentials: A Bayesian Neural Network Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13805v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning. In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolPIF: A Parameter Interpolation Flow Model for Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13762v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space. However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore, the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design, demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for model design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Optimization for Molecules Should Be Pareto-Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13704v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) provides a principled framework for navigating trade-offs in molecular design. However, its empirical advantages over scalarized alternatives remain underexplored. We benchmark a simple Pareto-based MOBO strategy -- Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) -- against a simple fixed-weight scalarized baseline using Expected Improvement (EI), under a tightly controlled setup with identical Gaussian Process surrogates and molecular representations. Across three molecular optimization tasks, EHVI consistently outperforms scalarized EI in terms of Pareto front coverage, convergence speed, and chemical diversity. While scalarization encompasses flexible variants -- including random or adaptive schemes -- our results show that even strong deterministic instantiations can underperform in low-data regimes. These findings offer concrete evidence for the practical advantages of Pareto-aware acquisition in de novo molecular optimization, especially when evaluation budgets are limited and trade-offs are nontrivial.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification over Affine Poisson Channels: Application to Molecular Mixture Communication Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11569v3)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identification capacity has been established as a relevant performance metric for various goal-/task-oriented applications, where the receiver may be interested in only a particular message that represents an event or a task. For example, in olfactory molecular communications (MCs), odors or pheromones, which are often a mixture of various molecule types, may signal nearby danger, food, or a mate. In this paper, we examine the identification capacity with deterministic encoder for the discrete affine Poisson channel which can be used to model MC systems with molecule counting receivers. We establish lower and upper bounds on the identification capacity in terms of features of the affinity matrix between the released molecules and receptors at the receiver. As a key finding, we show that even when the number of receptor types scales sub-linearly in the number of molecule types $N,$ the number of reliably identifiable messages can grow super-exponentially with the rank of the affinity matrix, $T,$ i.e., $\sim 2^{(T \log T)R},$ where $R$ denotes the coding rate. We further derive lower and upper bounds on $R,$ and show that the proposed capacity theorem includes several known results in the literature as its special cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 Pa...</summary><p>11 Pages.

| **[KEPLA: A Knowledge-Enhanced Deep Learning Framework for Accurate Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13196v3)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity is critical for drug discovery. While recent deep learning approaches have demonstrated promising results, they often rely solely on structural features of proteins and ligands, overlooking their valuable biochemical knowledge associated with binding affinity. To address this limitation, we propose KEPLA, a novel deep learning framework that explicitly integrates prior knowledge from Gene Ontology and ligand properties to enhance prediction performance. KEPLA takes protein sequences and ligand molecular graphs as input and optimizes two complementary objectives: (1) aligning global representations with knowledge graph relations to capture domain-specific biochemical insights, and (2) leveraging cross attention between local representations to construct fine-grained joint embeddings for prediction. Experiments on two benchmark datasets across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that KEPLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, interpretability analyses based on knowledge graph relations and cross attention maps provide valuable insights into the underlying predictive mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Deep Learning Framework for Inverse Design of Fuels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12075v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the present work, a generative deep learning framework combining a Co-optimized Variational Autoencoder (Co-VAE) architecture with quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) techniques is developed to enable accelerated inverse design of fuels. The Co-VAE integrates a property prediction component coupled with the VAE latent space, enhancing molecular reconstruction and accurate estimation of Research Octane Number (RON) (chosen as the fuel property of interest). A subset of the GDB-13 database, enriched with a curated RON database, is used for model training. Hyperparameter tuning is further utilized to optimize the balance among reconstruction fidelity, chemical validity, and RON prediction. An independent regression model is then used to refine RON prediction, while a differential evolution algorithm is employed to efficiently navigate the VAE latent space and identify promising fuel molecule candidates with high RON. This methodology addresses the limitations of traditional fuel screening approaches by capturing complex structure-property relationships within a comprehensive latent representation. The generative model can be adapted to different target properties, enabling systematic exploration of large chemical spaces relevant to fuel design applications. Furthermore, the demonstrated framework can be readily extended by incorporating additional synthesizability criteria to improve applicability and reliability for de novo design of new fuels.</p></details> |  |

| **[Computing and Bounding Equilibrium Concentrations in Athermic Chemical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12699v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing equilibrium concentrations of molecular complexes is generally analytically intractable and requires numerical approaches. In this work we focus on the polymer-monomer level, where indivisible molecules (monomers) combine to form complexes (polymers). Rather than employing free-energy parameters for each polymer, we focus on the athermic setting where all interactions preserve enthalpy. This setting aligns with the strongly bonded (domain-based) regime in DNA nanotechnology when strands can bind in different ways, but always with maximum overall bonding -- and is consistent with the saturated configurations in the Thermodynamic Binding Networks (TBNs) model. Within this context, we develop an iterative algorithm for assigning polymer concentrations to satisfy detailed-balance, where on-target (desired) polymers are in high concentrations and off-target (undesired) polymers are in low. Even if not directly executed, our algorithm provides effective insights into upper bounds on concentration of off-target polymers, connecting combinatorial arguments about discrete configurations such as those in the TBN model to real-valued concentrations. We conclude with an application of our method to decreasing leak in DNA logic and signal propagation. Our results offer a new framework for design and verification of equilibrium concentrations when configurations are distinguished by entropic forces.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in DNA31 (31st International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming)</p></details> |
| **[SynCoGen: Synthesizable 3D Molecule Generation via Joint Reaction and Coordinate Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11818v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring synthesizability in generative small molecule design remains a major challenge. While recent developments in synthesizable molecule generation have demonstrated promising results, these efforts have been largely confined to 2D molecular graph representations, limiting the ability to perform geometry-based conditional generation. In this work, we present SynCoGen (Synthesizable Co-Generation), a single framework that combines simultaneous masked graph diffusion and flow matching for synthesizable 3D molecule generation. SynCoGen samples from the joint distribution of molecular building blocks, chemical reactions, and atomic coordinates. To train the model, we curated SynSpace, a dataset containing over 600K synthesis-aware building block graphs and 3.3M conformers. SynCoGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional small molecule graph and conformer generation, and the model delivers competitive performance in zero-shot molecular linker design for protein ligand generation in drug discovery. Overall, this multimodal formulation represents a foundation for future applications enabled by non-autoregressive molecular generation, including analog expansion, lead optimization, and direct structure conditioning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Torsional-GFN: a conditional conformation generator for small molecules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11759v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating stable molecular conformations is crucial in several drug discovery applications, such as estimating the binding affinity of a molecule to a target. Recently, generative machine learning methods have emerged as a promising, more efficient method than molecular dynamics for sampling of conformations from the Boltzmann distribution. In this paper, we introduce Torsional-GFN, a conditional GFlowNet specifically designed to sample conformations of molecules proportionally to their Boltzmann distribution, using only a reward function as training signal. Conditioned on a molecular graph and its local structure (bond lengths and angles), Torsional-GFN samples rotations of its torsion angles. Our results demonstrate that Torsional-GFN is able to sample conformations approximately proportional to the Boltzmann distribution for multiple molecules with a single model, and allows for zero-shot generalization to unseen bond lengths and angles coming from the MD simulations for such molecules. Our work presents a promising avenue for scaling the proposed approach to larger molecular systems, achieving zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules, and including the generation of the local structure into the GFlowNet model.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The two first authors are Alexandra Volokhova and L\'ena N\'ehale Ezzine, with equal contribution</p></details> |
| **[Acquiring and Adapting Priors for Novel Tasks via Neural Meta-Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10446v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to transfer knowledge from prior experiences to novel tasks stands as a pivotal capability of intelligent agents, including both humans and computational models. This principle forms the basis of transfer learning, where large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream tasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of task adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where, due to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational models is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational immunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our work focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of priors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we demonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on non-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that our hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire more generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene generation, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a handful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We then extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel scenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed scenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a pre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction, addressing critical challenges in computational immunology.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.17075</p></details> |
| **[TextOmics-Guided Diffusion for Hit-like Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09982v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hit-like molecular generation with therapeutic potential is essential for target-specific drug discovery. However, the field lacks heterogeneous data and unified frameworks for integrating diverse molecular representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TextOmics, a pioneering benchmark that establishes one-to-one correspondences between omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions. TextOmics provides a heterogeneous dataset that facilitates molecular generation through representations alignment. Built upon this foundation, we propose ToDi, a generative framework that jointly conditions on omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions to produce biologically relevant, chemically valid, hit-like molecules. ToDi leverages two encoders (OmicsEn and TextEn) to capture multi-level biological and semantic associations, and develops conditional diffusion (DiffGen) for controllable generation. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of TextOmics and demonstrate ToDi outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, while also showcasing remarkable potential in zero-shot therapeutic molecular generation.

| **[Efficient Molecular Conformer Generation with SO(3)-Averaged Flow Matching and Reflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09785v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast and accurate generation of molecular conformers is desired for downstream computational chemistry and drug discovery tasks. Currently, training and sampling state-of-the-art diffusion or flow-based models for conformer generation require significant computational resources. In this work, we build upon flow-matching and propose two mechanisms for accelerating training and inference of generative models for 3D molecular conformer generation. For fast training, we introduce the SO(3)-Averaged Flow training objective, which leads to faster convergence to better generation quality compared to conditional optimal transport flow or Kabsch-aligned flow. We demonstrate that models trained using SO(3)-Averaged Flow can reach state-of-the-art conformer generation quality. For fast inference, we show that the reflow and distillation methods of flow-based models enable few-steps or even one-step molecular conformer generation with high quality. The training techniques proposed in this work show a path towards highly efficient molecular conformer generation with flow-based models.</p></details> | ICML 2025 poster |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v3)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning-Order Autoregressive Models with Application to Molecular Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05979v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models (ARMs) have become the workhorse for sequence generation tasks, since many problems can be modeled as next-token prediction. While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an order-policy, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation. On the challenging domain of molecular graph generation, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k benchmarks, evaluated across key metrics for distribution similarity and drug-likeless.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shortening the Trajectories: Identity-Aware Gaussian Approximation for Efficient 3D Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09043v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian-based Probabilistic Generative Models (GPGMs) generate data by reversing a stochastic process that progressively corrupts samples with Gaussian noise. While these models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, their practical deployment remains constrained by the high computational cost of long generative trajectories, which often involve hundreds to thousands of steps during training and sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretically grounded and empirically validated framework that improves generation efficiency without sacrificing training granularity or inference fidelity. Our key insight is that for certain data modalities, the noising process causes data to rapidly lose its identity and converge toward a Gaussian distribution. We analytically identify a characteristic step at which the data has acquired sufficient Gaussianity, and then replace the remaining generation trajectory with a closed-form Gaussian approximation. Unlike existing acceleration techniques that coarsening the trajectories by skipping steps, our method preserves the full resolution of learning dynamics while avoiding redundant stochastic perturbations between `Gaussian-like' distributions. Empirical results across multiple data modalities demonstrate substantial improvements in both sample quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting and generating antibiotics against future pathogens with ApexOracle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07862v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities, ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature" molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future infectious-disease outbreaks.</p></details> | 3 figures |
| **[Synthetic MC via Biological Transmitters: Therapeutic Modulation of the Gut-Brain Axis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07604v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However, generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices, poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal, safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA modulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MODA: A Unified 3D Diffusion Framework for Multi-Task Target-Aware Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07201v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional molecular generators based on diffusion models can now reach near-crystallographic accuracy, yet they remain fragmented across tasks. SMILES-only inputs, two-stage pretrain-finetune pipelines, and one-task-one-model practices hinder stereochemical fidelity, task alignment, and zero-shot transfer. We introduce MODA, a diffusion framework that unifies fragment growing, linker design, scaffold hopping, and side-chain decoration with a Bayesian mask scheduler. During training, a contiguous spatial fragment is masked and then denoised in one pass, enabling the model to learn shared geometric and chemical priors across tasks. Multi-task training yields a universal backbone that surpasses six diffusion baselines and three training paradigms on substructure, chemical property, interaction, and geometry. Model-C reduces ligand-protein clashes and substructure divergences while maintaining Lipinski compliance, whereas Model-B preserves similarity but trails in novelty and binding affinity. Zero-shot de novo design and lead-optimisation tests confirm stable negative Vina scores and high improvement rates without force-field refinement. These results demonstrate that a single-stage multi-task diffusion routine can replace two-stage workflows for structure-based molecular design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Implementation of Gaussian Process Regression Accelerated Saddle Point Searches with Application to Molecular Reactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12519v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of locating first order saddle points on high-dimensional surfaces describing the variation of energy as a function of atomic coordinates is an essential step for identifying the mechanism and estimating the rate of thermally activated events within the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. When combined directly with electronic structure calculations, the number of energy and atomic force evaluations needed for convergence is a primary issue. Here, we describe an efficient implementation of Gaussian process regression (GPR) acceleration of the minimum mode following method where a dimer is used to estimate the lowest eigenmode of the Hessian. A surrogate energy surface is constructed and updated after each electronic structure calculation. The method is applied to a test set of 500 molecular reactions previously generated by Hermez and coworkers [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 18, 6974 (2022)]. An order of magnitude reduction in the number of electronic structure calculations needed to reach the saddle point configurations is obtained by using the GPR compared to the dimer method. Despite the wide range in stiffness of the molecular degrees of freedom, the calculations are carried out using Cartesian coordinates and are found to require similar number of electronic structure calculations as an elaborate internal coordinate method implemented in the Sella software package. The present implementation of the GPR surrogate model in C++ is efficient enough for the wall time of the saddle point searches to be reduced in 3 out of 4 cases even though the calculations are carried out at a low Hartree-Fock level.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Navigating Sparse Molecular Data with Stein Diffusion Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05482v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic optimal control (SOC) has recently emerged as a principled framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. However, its dependence on computationally intensive simulations makes it impractical for fast sampling. In parallel, a class of training-free approaches has been developed that guides diffusion models using off-the-shelf classifiers on predicted clean samples, bypassing the need to train classifiers on noisy data. These methods can be interpreted as approximate SOC schemes, using Tweedie's formula to estimate diffusion posteriors. In practice, however, such direct approximations can introduce significant errors, leading to unreliable guidance. In this work, we unify the strengths of both paradigms by proposing a novel training-free diffusion guidance framework based on a surrogate stochastic optimal control objective. We derive a new theoretical bound on the value function that reveals the necessity of correcting the approximate posteriors to remain faithful to the true diffusion posterior. To this end, we connect the problem with Stein variational inference, which seeks the steepest descent direction that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between the two posteriors. Our method, which we refer to as Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), introduces a principled correction mechanism and incorporates a novel running cost functional to enable effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on challenging molecular generation tasks demonstrate that SDG significantly outperforms standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential for broader applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[Structural Connectome Harmonization Using Deep Learning: The Strength of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13992v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small sample sizes in neuroimaging in general, and in structural connectome (SC) studies in particular limit the development of reliable biomarkers for neurological and psychiatric disorders - such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia - by reducing statistical power, reliability, and generalizability. Large-scale multi-site studies have exist, but they have acquisition-related biases due to scanner heterogeneity, compromising imaging consistency and downstream analyses. While existing SC harmonization methods - such as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate these biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or overlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a site-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across diverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a simulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this framework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected autoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a top-performing LR baseline. While non-graph models excel in edge-weight prediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior preservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as reflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively. Although the LR baseline achieves the highest numerical performance by explicitly modeling acquisition parameters, it lacks applicability to real-world multi-site use cases as detailed acquisition metadata is often unavailable. Our results highlight the critical role of model architecture in SC harmonization performance and demonstrate that graph-based approaches are particularly well-suited for structure-aware, domain-generalizable SC harmonization in large-scale multi-site SC studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Anomaly Detection with Graph Neural Networks using Controllability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13954v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex domains poses significant challenges due to the need for extensive labeled data and the inherently imbalanced nature of anomalous versus benign samples. Graph-based machine learning models have emerged as a promising solution that combines attribute and relational data to uncover intricate patterns. However, the scarcity of anomalous data exacerbates the challenge, which requires innovative strategies to enhance model learning with limited information. In this paper, we hypothesize that the incorporation of the influence of the nodes, quantified through average controllability, can significantly improve the performance of anomaly detection. We propose two novel approaches to integrate average controllability into graph-based frameworks: (1) using average controllability as an edge weight and (2) encoding it as a one-hot edge attribute vector. Through rigorous evaluation on real-world and synthetic networks with six state-of-the-art baselines, our proposed methods demonstrate improved performance in identifying anomalies, highlighting the critical role of controllability measures in enhancing the performance of graph machine learning models. This work underscores the potential of integrating average controllability as additional metrics to address the challenges of anomaly detection in sparse and imbalanced datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>confe...</summary><p>conference paper published in IEEE CAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[When Speed meets Accuracy: an Efficient and Effective Graph Model for Temporal Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13825v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a critical task with applications in diverse domains such as social networks, recommendation systems, and e-commerce platforms. While existing Temporal Graph Neural Networks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex architectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer from scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE consists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most recent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware module that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence of globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on data characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant improvements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal graphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency, delivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in 2024.

| **[Efficient and Scalable Self-Healing Databases Using Meta-Learning and Dependency-Driven Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13757v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explored the development of a novel self-healing framework for databases using meta-learning and reinforcement learning techniques. The primary objective was to address the challenges of real-time adaptability and minimal retraining in dynamic workload environments. The proposed approach integrated Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) with reinforcement learning to enable anomaly detection and corrective actions that adapted swiftly to evolving database conditions. Multi-objective optimization was employed to balance performance, resource utilization, and cost efficiency during the healing process. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) were incorporated to model interdependencies within database components, ensuring holistic recovery strategies. Data efficiency was enhanced through synthetic task augmentation and self-supervised learning, enabling effective training in sparse data regimes. To promote trust and transparency, explainable AI techniques were integrated to provide interpretable insights into anomaly detection and healing actions. Federated meta-learning further enabled privacy-preserving adaptability in distributed database environments. The framework demonstrated significant improvements in adaptability, efficiency, and reliability, contributing to advancements in database management and self-healing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SamGoG: A Sampling-Based Graph-of-Graphs Framework for Imbalanced Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13741v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in graph classification tasks by capturing both structural and feature-based representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit two critical forms of imbalance: class imbalance and graph size imbalance. These imbalances can bias the learning process and degrade model performance. Existing methods typically address only one type of imbalance or incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose SamGoG, a sampling-based Graph-of-Graphs (GoG) learning framework that effectively mitigates both class and graph size imbalance. SamGoG constructs multiple GoGs through an efficient importance-based sampling mechanism and trains on them sequentially. This sampling mechanism incorporates the learnable pairwise similarity and adaptive GoG node degree to enhance edge homophily, thus improving downstream model quality. SamGoG can seamlessly integrate with various downstream GNNs, enabling their efficient adaptation for graph classification tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SamGoG achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to a 15.66% accuracy improvement with 6.7$\times$ training acceleration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Deformable Body Interactions With Adaptive Spatial Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13707v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating interactions between deformable bodies is vital in fields like material science, mechanical design, and robotics. While learning-based methods with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at solving complex physical systems, they encounter scalability issues when modeling deformable body interactions. To model interactions between objects, pairwise global edges have to be created dynamically, which is computationally intensive and impractical for large-scale meshes. To overcome these challenges, drawing on insights from geometric representations, we propose an Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST) method for efficient representation of physical states. By dividing the simulation space into a grid of cells and mapping unstructured meshes onto this structured grid, our approach naturally groups adjacent mesh nodes. We then apply a cross-attention module to map the sparse cells into a compact, fixed-length embedding, serving as tokens for the entire physical state. Self-attention modules are employed to predict the next state over these tokens in latent space. This framework leverages the efficiency of tokenization and the expressive power of attention mechanisms to achieve accurate and scalable simulation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in modeling deformable body interactions. Notably, it remains effective on large-scale simulations with meshes exceeding 100,000 nodes, where existing methods are hindered by computational limitations. Additionally, we contribute a novel large-scale dataset encompassing a wide range of deformable body interactions to support future research in this area.</p></details> | 21 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Binarizing Physics-Inspired GNNs for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13703v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-inspired graph neural networks (PI-GNNs) have been utilized as an efficient unsupervised framework for relaxing combinatorial optimization problems encoded through a specific graph structure and loss, reflecting dependencies between the problem's variables. While the framework has yielded promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025).

| **[Can we ease the Injectivity Bottleneck on Lorentzian Manifolds for Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00142v5)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While hyperbolic GNNs show promise for hierarchical data, they often have limited discriminative power compared to Euclidean counterparts or the WL test, due to non-injective aggregation. To address this expressivity gap, we propose the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel HGNN designed for enhanced discrimination within the Lorentzian model. LGIN introduces a new update rule that preserves the Lorentzian metric while effectively capturing richer structural information. This marks a significant step towards more expressive GNNs on Riemannian manifolds. Extensive evaluations across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate LGIN's superior performance, consistently outperforming or matching state-of-the-art hyperbolic and Euclidean baselines, showcasing its ability to capture complex graph structures. LGIN is the first to adapt principles of powerful, highly discriminative GNN architectures to a Riemannian manifold.

| **[AI-Accelerated Flow Simulation: A Robust Auto-Regressive Framework for Long-Term CFD Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05657v3)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the critical challenge of error accumulation in spatio-temporal auto-regressive (AR) predictions within scientific machine learning models by exploring temporal integration schemes and adaptive multi-step rollout strategies. We introduce the first implementation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth method specifically tailored for data-driven AR prediction, leveraging historical derivative information to enhance numerical stability without additional computational overhead. To validate our approach, we systematically evaluate time integration schemes across canonical 2D PDEs before extending to complex Navier-Stokes cylinder vortex shedding dynamics. Additionally, we develop three novel adaptive weighting strategies that dynamically adjust the importance of different future time steps during multi-step rollout training. Our analysis reveals that as physical complexity increases, such sophisticated rollout techniques become essential, with the Adams-Bashforth scheme demonstrating consistent robustness across investigated systems and our best adaptive approach delivering an 89% improvement over conventional fixed-weight methods while maintaining similar computational costs. For the complex Navier-Stokes vortex shedding problem, despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps reducing mean squared error from 0.125 (single-step direct prediction) to 0.002 (Adams-Bashforth with proposed multi-step rollout). Our integrated methodology demonstrates an 83% improvement over standard noise injection techniques and maintains robustness under severe spatial constraints; specifically, when trained on only a partial spatial domain, it still achieves 58% and 27% improvements over direct prediction and forward Euler methods, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Surrogates for Contacting Deformable Bodies with Necessary and Sufficient Contact Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13459v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surrogate models for the rapid inference of nonlinear boundary value problems in mechanics are helpful in a broad range of engineering applications. However, effective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of deformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an open issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact or, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact planes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that serve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions for detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture that utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time, incorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable bodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft tissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic valve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the loss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits hold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and complex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also demonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries. However, such benefits come with high computational costs during training, resulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the training cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware architectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in up to a thousand-fold speedup for our benchmark problems at inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Air Traffic Controller Task Demand via Graph Neural Networks: An Interpretable Approach to Airspace Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13423v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time assessment of near-term Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) task demand is a critical challenge in an increasingly crowded airspace, as existing complexity metrics often fail to capture nuanced operational drivers beyond simple aircraft counts. This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller training and airspace redesign.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author Accepted Manuscript version of paper at the AIAA AVIATION Forum 2025</p></details> |
| **[Generative Diffusion Models for Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20277v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a supervised training algorithm for learning stochastic resource allocation policies with generative diffusion models (GDMs). We formulate the allocation problem as the maximization of an ergodic utility function subject to ergodic Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Given samples from a stochastic expert policy that yields a near-optimal solution to the constrained optimization problem, we train a GDM policy to imitate the expert and generate new samples from the optimal distribution. We achieve near-optimal performance through the sequential execution of the generated samples. To enable generalization to a family of network configurations, we parameterize the backward diffusion process with a graph neural network (GNN) architecture. We present numerical results in a case study of power control.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spectral Interpretation of Redundancy in a Graph Reservoir](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12963v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computing has been successfully applied to graphs as a preprocessing method to improve the training efficiency of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying layer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence of graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This work revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir Graph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a variant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of surface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band spectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted to the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral formulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks where smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it shows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the contribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the MRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest promising directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 3rd International Workshop on Reservoir Computing (RC 2025) at ICANN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Channel Graph Neural Network for Financial Risk Prediction of NEEQ Enterprises](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12787v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the continuous evolution of China's multi-level capital market, the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), also known as the "New Third Board," has become a critical financing platform for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, due to their limited scale and financial resilience, many NEEQ-listed companies face elevated risks of financial distress. To address this issue, we propose a multi-channel deep learning framework that integrates structured financial indicators, textual disclosures, and enterprise relationship data for comprehensive financial risk prediction. Specifically, we design a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) that processes numeric, textual, and graph-based inputs separately. These modality-specific representations are fused using an attention-based mechanism followed by a gating unit to enhance robustness and prediction accuracy. Experimental results on data from 7,731 real-world NEEQ companies demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods and single-modality baselines in terms of AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. This work provides theoretical and practical insights into risk modeling for SMEs and offers a data-driven tool to support financial regulators and investors.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures.

| **[MS-DGCNN++: A Multi-Scale Fusion Dynamic Graph Neural Network with Biological Knowledge Integration for LiDAR Tree Species Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12602v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS, outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy. Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/said-ohamouddou/MS-DGCNN2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rel-HNN: Split Parallel Hypergraph Neural Network for Learning on Relational Databases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12562v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational databases (RDBs) are ubiquitous in enterprise and real-world applications. Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models that rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics from the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational structures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring intra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based framework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair as a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained intra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level representations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the scalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a split-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for efficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing methods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our split-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for learning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared to conventional single-GPU execution.</p></details> |  |

| **[A General Framework for Inference-time Scaling and Steering of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06848v5)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we present Feynman-Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models - even with off-the-shelf rewards - can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

While recent personalization methods have explored the decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight, task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video understanding.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved DDIM Sampling with Moment Matching Gaussian Mixtures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04938v3)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as reverse transition operator (kernel) within the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) framework, which is one of the most widely used approaches for accelerated sampling from pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). Specifically we match the first and second order central moments of the DDPM forward marginals by constraining the parameters of the GMM. We see that moment matching is sufficient to obtain samples with equal or better quality than the original DDIM with Gaussian kernels. We provide experimental results with unconditional models trained on CelebAHQ and FFHQ and class-conditional models trained on ImageNet datasets respectively. Our results suggest that using the GMM kernel leads to significant improvements in the quality of the generated samples when the number of sampling steps is small, as measured by FID and IS metrics. For example on ImageNet 256x256, using 10 sampling steps, we achieve a FID of 6.94 and IS of 207.85 with a GMM kernel compared to 10.15 and 196.73 respectively with a Gaussian kernel.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 14 figures; Analysis of DDIM-GMM as a multimodal denoiser; Additional experiments on LSUN datasets and text-to-image generation with Stable Diffusion; Comparison with DPM-Solver; Ablations on GMM parameters; Updated equations with bold font for vectors and matrices</p></details> |
| **[DiffAD: A Unified Diffusion Modeling Approach for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12170v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has rapidly emerged as a promising approach toward achieving full autonomy. However, existing E2E-AD systems typically adopt a traditional multi-task framework, addressing perception, prediction, and planning tasks through separate task-specific heads. Despite being trained in a fully differentiable manner, they still encounter issues with task coordination, and the system complexity remains high. In this work, we introduce DiffAD, a novel diffusion probabilistic model that redefines autonomous driving as a conditional image generation task. By rasterizing heterogeneous targets onto a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) and modeling their latent distribution, DiffAD unifies various driving objectives and jointly optimizes all driving tasks in a single framework, significantly reducing system complexity and harmonizing task coordination. The reverse process iteratively refines the generated BEV image, resulting in more robust and realistic driving behaviors. Closed-loop evaluations in Carla demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, achieving a new state-of-the-art Success Rate and Driving Score.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures; Code released</p></details> |
| **[DynFaceRestore: Balancing Fidelity and Quality in Diffusion-Guided Blind Face Restoration with Dynamic Blur-Level Mapping and Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13797v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion, resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce MorphoNAS (Morphogenetic Neural Architecture Search), a system able to deterministically grow neural networks through morphogenetic self-organization inspired by the Free Energy Principle, reaction-diffusion systems, and gene regulatory networks. In MorphoNAS, simple genomes encode just morphogens dynamics and threshold-based rules of cellular development. Nevertheless, this leads to self-organization of a single progenitor cell into complex neural networks, while the entire process is built on local chemical interactions. Our evolutionary experiments focused on two different domains: structural targeting, in which MorphoNAS system was able to find fully successful genomes able to generate predefined random graph configurations (8-31 nodes); and functional performance on the CartPole control task achieving low complexity 6-7 neuron solutions when target network size minimization evolutionary pressure was applied. The evolutionary process successfully balanced between quality of of the final solutions and neural architecture search effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that the proposed MorphoNAS method is able to grow complex specific neural architectures, using simple developmental rules, which suggests a feasible biological route to adaptive and efficient neural architecture search.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures; Preprint of a manuscript submitted for peer review</p></details> |
| **[Learning Spectral Diffusion Prior for Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13769v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inversion-DPO: Precise and Efficient Post-Training for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11554v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient, high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to complex realistic generation tasks.

However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage available at https://simplegvr.github.io/</p></details> |

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

Linear combinations of such functions are called graph motif parameters and have recently received significant attention in counting complexity after a seminal paper by Curticapean, Dell and Marx (STOC'17). We show that, among linear combinations of functions #IndSub(H,*) involving only graphs H without isolated vertices, precisely those with positive integer coefficients maintain a combinatorial interpretation. It is important to note that graph motif parameters can be nonnegative for all inputs G, even when some coefficients are negative. Formally, we show that evaluating any graph motif parameter with a negative coefficient is impossible in an oracle variant of #P, where an implicit graph is accessed by oracle queries. Our proof follows the classification of the relativizing closure properties of #P by Hertrampf, Vollmer, and Wagner (SCT'95) and the framework developed by Ikenmeyer and Pak (STOC'22), but our application of the required Ramsey theorem turns out to be more subtle, as graphs do not have the required Ramsey property. Our techniques generalize from graphs to relational structures, including colored graphs. Vastly generalizing this, we introduce motif parameters over categories that count occurrences of sub-objects in the category. We then prove a general dichotomy theorem that characterizes which such parameters have a combinatorial interpretation. Using known results in Ramsey theory for categories, we obtain a dichotomy for motif parameters of finite vector spaces as well as parameter sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, full version</p></details> |

This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity connections across frames. We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models to discriminate between coherent image sequences and stories from unrelated images. We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to teach appropriate entity connection behavior. We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic contexts. Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on Qwen2.5-VL 7B). Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1 from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%). Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except "its", and cross-frame character and object persistence increased across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%). Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story, increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[SQLNet: Scale-Modulated Query and Localization Network for Few-Shot Class-Agnostic Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10011v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The class-agnostic counting (CAC) task has recently been proposed to solve the problem of counting all objects of an arbitrary class with several exemplars given in the input image. To address this challenging task, existing leading methods all resort to density map regression, which renders them impractical for downstream tasks that require object locations and restricts their ability to well explore the scale information of exemplars for supervision. To address the limitations, we propose a novel localization-based CAC approach, termed Scale-modulated Query and Localization Network (SQLNet). It fully explores the scales of exemplars in both the query and localization stages and achieves effective counting by accurately locating each object and predicting its approximate size. Specifically, during the query stage, rich discriminative representations of the target class are acquired by the Hierarchical Exemplars Collaborative Enhancement (HECE) module from the few exemplars through multi-scale exemplar cooperation with equifrequent size prompt embedding. These representations are then fed into the Exemplars-Unified Query Correlation (EUQC) module to interact with the query features in a unified manner and produce the correlated query tensor. In the localization stage, the Scale-aware Multi-head Localization (SAML) module utilizes the query tensor to predict the confidence, location, and size of each potential object. Moreover, a scale-aware localization loss is introduced, which exploits flexible location associations and exemplar scales for supervision to optimize the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SQLNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular CAC benchmarks, achieving excellent performance not only in counting accuracy but also in localization and bounding box generation.

| **[Text-promptable Object Counting via Quantity Awareness Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06679v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in solving the text-promptable object counting problem. Representative methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness. Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147, CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability for zero-shot class-agnostic counting.

| **[Counting Stacked Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19149v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual object counting is a fundamental computer vision task underpinning numerous real-world applications, from cell counting in biomedicine to traffic and wildlife monitoring. However, existing methods struggle to handle the challenge of stacked 3D objects in which most objects are hidden by those above them. To address this important yet underexplored problem, we propose a novel 3D counting approach that decomposes the task into two complementary subproblems - estimating the 3D geometry of the object stack and the occupancy ratio from multi-view images. By combining geometric reconstruction and deep learning-based depth analysis, our method can accurately count identical objects within containers, even when they are irregularly stacked. We validate our 3D Counting pipeline on diverse real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets, which we will release publicly to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV2...</summary><p>ICCV25.

| **[Prompt-Free Conditional Diffusion for Multi-object Image Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06146v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models has underpinned much recent advances of dataset augmentation in various computer vision tasks. However, when involving generating multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images, resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization capabilities.

In this work, we present the first large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions: (1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3) How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context? Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key areas for improvement in medical visual language models.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we evaluate the extent to which vision-and-language models (VLMs) are compatible with humans when producing or judging the appropriateness of vague quantifiers in visual contexts. We release a novel dataset, VAQUUM, containing 20,300 human ratings on quantified statements across a total of 1089 images. Using this dataset, we compare human judgments and VLM predictions using three different evaluation methods. Our findings show that VLMs, like humans, are influenced by object counts in vague quantifier use. However, we find significant inconsistencies across models in different evaluation settings, suggesting that judging and producing vague quantifiers rely on two different processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ACL 2025, 10 pages</p></details> |

Despite progress in computer vision, existing benchmarks reveal significant gaps in models' abilities to accurately recognize object attributes and reason about spatial relationships, both essential for dynamic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose MIRAGE, a multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate models' capabilities in Counting (object attribute recognition), Relation (spatial relational reasoning), and Counting with Relation. Through diverse and complex scenarios requiring fine-grained recognition and reasoning, MIRAGE highlights critical limitations in state-of-the-art models, underscoring the need for improved representations and reasoning frameworks. By targeting these foundational abilities, MIRAGE provides a pathway toward spatiotemporal reasoning in future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Theory of Conditional Feature Alignment for Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17137v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object counting models suffer when deployed across domains with differing density variety, since density shifts are inherently task-relevant and violate standard domain adaptation assumptions. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets (e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in unsupervised domain-adaptive counting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with varying density distributions. The results show that our method outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Unlike prior approaches that mostly rely on deterministic part pose prediction and category-specific training, Assembler is designed to handle diverse, in-the-wild objects with varying part counts, geometries, and structures. It addresses the core challenges of scaling to general 3D part assembly through innovations in task formulation, representation, and data. First, Assembler casts part assembly as a generative problem and employs diffusion models to sample plausible configurations, effectively capturing ambiguities arising from symmetry, repeated parts, and multiple valid assemblies. Second, we introduce a novel shape-centric representation based on sparse anchor point clouds, enabling scalable generation in Euclidean space rather than SE(3) pose prediction. Third, we construct a large-scale dataset of over 320K diverse part-object assemblies using a synthesis and filtering pipeline built on existing 3D shape repositories. Assembler achieves state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and is the first to demonstrate high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects. Based on Assembler, we further introduce an interesting part-aware 3D modeling system that generates high-resolution, editable objects from images, demonstrating potential for interactive and compositional design.

This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and significantly outperforms strong baselines.

However, extending this success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle, synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math, showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.</p></details> |  |

We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the \textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach for reducing it.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARMOT: Masked Autoencoder for Modeling Transient Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08470v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained models have demonstrated impressive success in many modalities such as language and vision. Recent works facilitate the pretraining paradigm in imaging research. Transients are a novel modality, which are captured for an object as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved sensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of hidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using NLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or surfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned from datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling transient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a self-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient datasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features from partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the unmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts full measurements. Pretrained on TransVerse-a synthesized transient dataset of 500K 3D models-MARMOT adapts to downstream imaging tasks using direct feature transfer or decoder finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the efficiency of our MARMOT.</p></details> |  |
| **[ComPtr: Towards Diverse Bi-source Dense Prediction Tasks via A Simple yet General Complementary Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12349v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) has advanced the field of dense prediction, while gradually dissolving the inherent barriers between different tasks. However, most existing works focus on designing architectures and constructing visual cues only for the specific task, which ignores the potential uniformity introduced by the DL paradigm. In this paper, we attempt to construct a novel $\underline{ComP}$lementary $\underline{tr}$ansformer, $\textbf{ComPtr}$, for diverse bi-source dense prediction tasks. Specifically, unlike existing methods that over-specialize in a single task or a subset of tasks, ComPtr starts from the more general concept of bi-source dense prediction. Based on the basic dependence on information complementarity, we propose consistency enhancement and difference awareness components with which ComPtr can evacuate and collect important visual semantic cues from different image sources for diverse tasks, respectively. ComPtr treats different inputs equally and builds an efficient dense interaction model in the form of sequence-to-sequence on top of the transformer. This task-generic design provides a smooth foundation for constructing the unified model that can simultaneously deal with various bi-source information. In extensive experiments across several representative vision tasks, i.e. remote sensing change detection, RGB-T crowd counting, RGB-D/T salient object detection, and RGB-D semantic segmentation, the proposed method consistently obtains favorable performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/lartpang/ComPtr.</p></details> |  |

| **[Automated Interpretation of Non-Destructive Evaluation Contour Maps Using Large Language Models for Bridge Condition Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14107v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridge maintenance and safety are essential for transportation authorities, and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques are critical to assessing structural integrity. However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and requires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this analysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities for interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in providing detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for integrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted analysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study, several LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the quality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different NDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions. Each LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed descriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and demonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine models provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of topics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models are summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of the bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more effective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an innovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and summarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and enhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Pre-training of Multimodal Language Models Customized for Chart Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14506v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies customizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for domain-specific tasks have yielded promising results, especially in the field of scientific chart comprehension. These studies generally utilize visual instruction tuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer (QA) accuracy within the chart domain. However, they often neglect the fundamental discrepancy between natural image-caption pre-training data and digital chart image-QA data, particularly in the models' capacity to extract underlying numeric values from charts. This paper tackles this oversight by exploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs' comprehension of charts. We present three key findings: (1) Incorporating raw data values in alignment pre-training markedly improves comprehension of chart data. (2) Replacing images with their textual representation randomly during end-to-end fine-tuning transfer the language reasoning capability to chart interpretation skills. (3) Requiring the model to first extract the underlying chart data and then answer the question in the fine-tuning can further improve the accuracy. Consequently, we introduce CHOPINLLM, an MLLM tailored for in-depth chart comprehension. CHOPINLLM effectively interprets various types of charts, including unannotated ones, while maintaining robust reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of different chart types across various comprehension levels. Experimental results show that CHOPINLLM exhibits strong performance in understanding both annotated and unannotated charts across a wide range of types.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Adaptive Foundation Models</p></details> |
| **[SEER: Semantic Enhancement and Emotional Reasoning Network for Multimodal Fake News Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13415v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies on multimodal fake news detection mainly focus on the alignment and integration of cross-modal features, as well as the application of text-image consistency. However, they overlook the semantic enhancement effects of large multimodal models and pay little attention to the emotional features of news. In addition, people find that fake news is more inclined to contain negative emotions than real ones. Therefore, we propose a novel Semantic Enhancement and Emotional Reasoning (SEER) Network for multimodal fake news detection. We generate summarized captions for image semantic understanding and utilize the products of large multimodal models for semantic enhancement. Inspired by the perceived relationship between news authenticity and emotional tendencies, we propose an expert emotional reasoning module that simulates real-life scenarios to optimize emotional features and infer the authenticity of news. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our SEER over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | Accepted by SMC 2025 |
| **[KEN: Knowledge Augmentation and Emotion Guidance Network for Multimodal Fake News Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09647v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the rampant spread of misinformation on social media has made accurate detection of multimodal fake news a critical research focus. However, previous research has not adequately understood the semantics of images, and models struggle to discern news authenticity with limited textual information. Meanwhile, treating all emotional types of news uniformly without tailored approaches further leads to performance degradation. Therefore, we propose a novel Knowledge Augmentation and Emotion Guidance Network (KEN). On the one hand, we effectively leverage LVLM's powerful semantic understanding and extensive world knowledge. For images, the generated captions provide a comprehensive understanding of image content and scenes, while for text, the retrieved evidence helps break the information silos caused by the closed and limited text and context. On the other hand, we consider inter-class differences between different emotional types of news through balanced learning, achieving fine-grained modeling of the relationship between emotional types and authenticity. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our KEN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[SCMM: Calibrating Cross-modal Representations for Text-Based Person Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02278v7)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) faces critical challenges in cross-modal information fusion, requiring effective alignment of visual and textual modalities for person retrieval using natural language queries. Existing methods struggle with cross-modal heterogeneity, where visual and textual features reside in disparate semantic spaces, creating substantial inter-modal gaps that limit fusion effectiveness. We propose SCMM (Sew Calibration and Masked Modeling), a novel framework addressing these fusion challenges through two complementary mechanisms. First, our sew calibration loss implements adaptive margin constraints guided by caption quality, dynamically aligning image-text features while accommodating varying information density across modalities. Second, our masked caption modeling loss establishes fine-grained cross-modal correspondences through masked prediction tasks and cross-modal attention, enabling detailed visual-textual relationship learning. The streamlined dual-encoder architecture maintains computational efficiency while achieving superior fusion performance through synergistic alignment and correspondence strategies. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate SCMM's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art Rank1 accuracies of 73.81%, 64.25%, and 57.35% on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReID respectively. These results demonstrate the importance of quality-aware adaptive constraints and fine-grained correspondence modeling in advancing multimodal information fusion for person search applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[SEMT: Static-Expansion-Mesh Transformer Network Architecture for Remote Sensing Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12845v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image captioning has emerged as a crucial task in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, enabling automated generation of descriptive text from visual content. In the context of remote sensing, image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex satellite imagery, aiding applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and urban planning. This motivates us, in this paper, to present a transformer based network architecture for remote sensing image captioning (RSIC) in which multiple techniques of Static Expansion, Memory-Augmented Self-Attention, Mesh Transformer are evaluated and integrated. We evaluate our proposed models using two benchmark remote sensing image datasets of UCM-Caption and NWPU-Caption. Our best model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on most of evaluation metrics, which demonstrates potential to apply for real-life remote sensing image systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCoT-RE: Multi-Faceted Chain-of-Thought and Re-Ranking for Training-Free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12819v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text, without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2025 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics</p></details> |
| **[RetinaLogos: Fine-Grained Synthesis of High-Resolution Retinal Images Through Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12887v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of high-quality, labelled retinal imaging data, which presents a significant challenge in the development of machine learning models for ophthalmology, hinders progress in the field. Existing methods for synthesising Colour Fundus Photographs (CFPs) largely rely on predefined disease labels, which restricts their ability to generate images that reflect fine-grained anatomical variations, subtle disease stages, and diverse pathological features beyond coarse class categories. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce an innovative pipeline that creates a large-scale, captioned retinal dataset comprising 1.4 million entries, called RetinaLogos-1400k. Specifically, RetinaLogos-1400k uses the visual language model(VLM) to describe retinal conditions and key structures, such as optic disc configuration, vascular distribution, nerve fibre layers, and pathological features. Building on this dataset, we employ a novel three-step training framework, RetinaLogos, which enables fine-grained semantic control over retinal images and accurately captures different stages of disease progression, subtle anatomical variations, and specific lesion types. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance across multiple datasets, with 62.07% of text-driven synthetic CFPs indistinguishable from real ones by ophthalmologists. Moreover, the synthetic data improves accuracy by 5%-10% in diabetic retinopathy grading and glaucoma detection. Codes are available at https://github.com/uni-medical/retina-text2cfp.</p></details> |  |
| **[CultureCLIP: Empowering CLIP with Cultural Awareness through Synthetic Images and Contextualized Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06210v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in general multimodal comprehension but often struggle to capture nuanced, context-dependent visual cues. This makes it difficult to distinguish between similar-looking concepts with potentially different cultural meanings. Such deficiencies are mainly due to a limited amount of high-quality cultural data, contextual information, and the lack of negative examples that highlight subtle differences. To mitigate this, we design a data curation pipeline leveraging open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image models to construct CulTwin, a synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but are culturally different. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to develop CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced captions and synthetic images through tailored contrastive learning. Experiments on culture-specific benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained concept recognition on certain tasks while preserving CLIP's original generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.</p></details> | 25 pages, COLM 2025 |

LG-CAV-MAE integrates a pretrained text encoder into contrastive audio-visual masked autoencoders, enabling the model to learn across audio, visual and text modalities. To train LG-CAV-MAE, we introduce an automatic method to generate audio-visual-text triplets from unlabeled videos. We first generate frame-level captions using an image captioning model and then apply CLAP-based filtering to ensure strong alignment between audio and captions. This approach yields high-quality audio-visual-text triplets without requiring manual annotations. We evaluate LG-CAV-MAE on audio-visual retrieval tasks, as well as an audio-visual classification task. Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to a 5.6% improvement in recall@10 for retrieval tasks and a 3.2% improvement for the classification task.</p></details> | Interspeech 2025 |
| **[TAB: Transformer Attention Bottlenecks enable User Intervention and Debugging in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18675v4)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) is a key component of Transformers, a widely popular architecture in both language and vision. Multiple heads intuitively enable different parallel processes over the same input. Yet, they also obscure the attribution of each input patch to the output of a model. We propose a novel 1-head Transformer Attention Bottleneck (TAB) layer, inserted after the traditional MHSA architecture, to serve as an attention bottleneck for interpretability and intervention. Unlike standard self-attention, TAB constrains the total attention over all patches to $\in [0, 1]$. That is, when the total attention is 0, no visual information is propagated further into the network, and the vision-language model (VLM) would default to a generic, image-independent response. To demonstrate the advantages of TAB, we train VLMs with TAB to perform image-difference captioning. Over three datasets, our models perform similarly to baseline VLMs in captioning but the bottleneck is superior in localizing changes and in identifying when no changes occur. TAB is the first architecture to enable users to debug by editing attention, which often produces expected outputs by VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[CV-Probes: Studying the interplay of lexical and world knowledge in visually grounded verb understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01389v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How do vision-language (VL) transformer models ground verb phrases and do they integrate contextual and world knowledge in this process? We introduce the CV-Probes dataset, containing image-caption pairs involving verb phrases that require both social knowledge and visual context to interpret (e.g., "beg"), as well as pairs involving verb phrases that can be grounded based on information directly available in the image (e.g., "sit"). We show that VL models struggle to ground VPs that are strongly context-dependent. Further analysis using explainable AI techniques shows that such models may not pay sufficient attention to the verb token in the captions. Our results suggest a need for improved methodologies in VL model training and evaluation. The code and dataset will be available https://github.com/ivana-13/CV-Probes.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figure, 6 tables, CogSci conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[ViLU: Learning Vision-Language Uncertainties for Failure Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07620v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations. ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found here: https://github.com/ykrmm/ViLU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent Natural Language with Communication Games for Improving Image Captioning Capabilities without Additional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08610v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems, and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models. Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the 'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the 'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the $44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the 'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii) a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNN-ViTCap: GNN-Enhanced Multiple Instance Learning with Vision Transformers for Whole Slide Image Classification and Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07006v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569 for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for microscopy based patient diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling Effective In-Context Configurations for Image Captioning: An External & Internal Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08021v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment. We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be applied to broader research areas.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |
| **[SVLA: A Unified Speech-Vision-Language Assistant with Multimodal Reasoning and Speech Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24164v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision and language models show strong performance in tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and retrieval. However, challenges remain in integrating speech, text, and vision into a unified model, especially for spoken tasks. Speech generation methods vary (some produce speech directly), others through text (but their impact on quality is unclear). Evaluation often relies on automatic speech recognition, which may introduce bias. We propose SVLA, a unified speech vision language model based on a transformer architecture that handles multimodal inputs and outputs. We train it on 38.2 million speech text image examples, including 64.1 hours of synthetic speech. We also introduce Speech VQA Accuracy, a new metric for evaluating spoken responses. SVLA improves multimodal understanding and generation by better combining speech, vision, and language.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[INTER: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models by Interaction Guidance Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05056v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content. This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced, cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings, we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Robust Hyper-Detailed Image Captioning: A Multiagent Approach and Dual Evaluation Metrics for Factuality and Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15484v4)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at generating highly detailed captions but often produce hallucinations. Our analysis reveals that existing hallucination detection methods struggle with detailed captions. We attribute this to the increasing reliance of MLLMs on their generated text, rather than the input image, as the sequence length grows. To address this issue, we propose a multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and a benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight a limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLM's performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/adobe-research/CapMAS.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Fine-Grained Captioning of Long Videos through Scene Graph Consolidation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16427v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models have led to impressive progress in caption generation for images and short video clips. However, these models remain constrained by their limited temporal receptive fields, making it difficult to produce coherent and comprehensive captions for long videos. While several methods have been proposed to aggregate information across video segments, they often rely on supervised fine-tuning or incur significant computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework for long video captioning based on graph consolidation. Our approach first generates segment-level captions, corresponding to individual frames or short video intervals, using off-the-shelf visual captioning models. These captions are then parsed into individual scene graphs, which are subsequently consolidated into a unified graph representation that preserves both holistic context and fine-grained details throughout the video. A lightweight graph-to-text decoder then produces the final video-level caption. This framework effectively extends the temporal understanding capabilities of existing models without requiring any additional fine-tuning on long video datasets. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms existing LLM-based consolidation approaches, achieving strong zero-shot performance while substantially reducing computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025)</p></details> |

The gated recurrent unit (GRU), which is a recent architecture in recurrent neural networks, is a strong candidate for obtaining such a model from data. However, due to their black-box nature, GRUs face challenges such as limited interpretability and vulnerability to overfitting. Recently, physics-guided neural networks (PGNNs) have been introduced, which integrate the prior physical model structure into the prediction process. This approach not only improves training convergence, but also facilitates the learning of a physics-based model. In this work, we integrate a GRU in the PGNN framework to obtain a PG-GRU, based on which we adopt a two-step approach to feedforward control design. First, we adopt stable inversion techniques to design a stable linear model of the inverse dynamics. Then, a GRU trained on the residual is tailored to inverse system identification. The resulting PG-GRU feedforward controller is validated by means of real-life experiments on a two-mass spring-damper system, where it demonstrates roughly a two-fold improvement compared to the linear feedforward and a preview-based GRU feedforward in terms of the integral absolute error.</p></details> | 8 pages |

There is a lot of variability in cuneiform signs, depending on where they come from, for what and by whom they were written, but also how they were digitized. This variability makes it unlikely that an ML model trained on one dataset will perform successfully on another dataset. This contribution studies how such differences impact that performance. Based on our results and insights, we aim to influence future data acquisition standards and provide a solid foundation for future cuneiform sign classification tasks. The ML model has been trained and tested on handwritten Old Babylonian (c. 2000-1600 B.C.E.) documentary texts inscribed on clay tablets originating from three Mesopotamian cities (Nippur, D\=ur-Abie\v{s}uh and Sippar). The presented and analysed model is ResNet50, which achieves a top-1 score of 87.1% and a top-5 score of 96.5% for signs with at least 20 instances. As these automatic classification results are the first on Old Babylonian texts, there are currently no comparable results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper under review at JOCCH</p></details> |

Yet some have questioned if the term still has meaning. AGI has been subject to so much hype and speculation it has become something of a Rorschach test. Melanie Mitchell argues the debate will only be settled through long term, scientific investigation. To that end here is a short, accessible and provocative overview of AGI. I compare definitions of intelligence, settling on intelligence in terms of adaptation and AGI as an artificial scientist. Taking my cue from Sutton's Bitter Lesson I describe two foundational tools used to build adaptive systems: search and approximation. I compare pros, cons, hybrids and architectures like o3, AlphaGo, AERA, NARS and Hyperon. I then discuss overall meta-approaches to making systems behave more intelligently. I divide them into scale-maxing, simp-maxing, w-maxing based on the Bitter Lesson, Ockham's and Bennett's Razors. These maximise resources, simplicity of form, and the weakness of constraints on functionality. I discuss examples including AIXI, the free energy principle and The Embiggening of language models. I conclude that though scale-maxed approximation dominates, AGI will be a fusion of tools and meta-approaches. The Embiggening was enabled by improvements in hardware.

| **[PROL : Rehearsal Free Continual Learning in Streaming Data via Prompt Online Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12305v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The data privacy constraint in online continual learning (OCL), where the data can be seen only once, complicates the catastrophic forgetting problem in streaming data. A common approach applied by the current SOTAs in OCL is with the use of memory saving exemplars or features from previous classes to be replayed in the current task. On the other hand, the prompt-based approach performs excellently in continual learning but with the cost of a growing number of trainable parameters. The first approach may not be applicable in practice due to data openness policy, while the second approach has the issue of throughput associated with the streaming data. In this study, we propose a novel prompt-based method for online continual learning that includes 4 main components: (1) single light-weight prompt generator as a general knowledge, (2) trainable scaler-and-shifter as specific knowledge, (3) pre-trained model (PTM) generalization preserving, and (4) hard-soft updates mechanism. Our proposed method achieves significantly higher performance than the current SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB dataset. Our complexity analysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of parameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput. For further study, the source code of our method is available at https://github.com/anwarmaxsum/PROL.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[2.5D Object Detection for Intelligent Roadside Infrastructure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03564v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On-board sensors of autonomous vehicles can be obstructed, occluded, or limited by restricted fields of view, complicating downstream driving decisions. Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage, supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a 2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse lighting and weather conditions.

| **[EXPO: Stable Reinforcement Learning with Expressive Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07986v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution. The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.</p></details> | <details><summary>corre...</summary><p>corrected typo, formatting, added experiments</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Variation-Resilient Random Number Generator for Embedded Encryption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05523v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With a growing interest in securing user data within the internet-of-things (IoT), embedded encryption has become of paramount importance, requiring light-weight high-quality Random Number Generators (RNGs). Emerging stochastic device technologies produce random numbers from stochastic physical processes at high quality, however, their generated random number streams are adversely affected by process and supply voltage variations, which can lead to bias in the generated streams. In this work, we present an adaptive variation-resilient RNG capable of extracting unbiased encryption-grade random number streams from physically driven entropy sources, for embedded cryptography applications. As a proof of concept, we employ a stochastic magnetic tunnel junction (sMTJ) device as an entropy source. The impact of variations in the sMTJ is mitigated by employing an adaptive digitizer with an adaptive voltage reference that dynamically tracks any stochastic signal drift or deviation, leading to unbiased random bit stream generation. The generated unbiased bit streams, due to their higher entropy, then only need to undergo simplified post-processing. Statistical randomness tests based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test suite are conducted on bit streams obtained using simulations and FPGA entropy source emulation experiments, validating encryption-grade randomness at a significantly reduced hardware cost, and across a wide range of process-induced device variations and supply voltage fluctuations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random weights of DNNs and emergence of fixed points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04182v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is concerned with a special class of deep neural networks (DNNs) where the input and the output vectors have the same dimension. Such DNNs are widely used in applications, e.g., autoencoders. The training of such networks can be characterized by their fixed points (FPs). We are concerned with the dependence of the FPs number and their stability on the distribution of randomly initialized DNNs' weight matrices. Specifically, we consider the i.i.d. random weights with heavy and light-tail distributions. Our objectives are twofold. First, the dependence of FPs number and stability of FPs on the type of the distribution tail. Second, the dependence of the number of FPs on the DNNs' architecture. We perform extensive simulations and show that for light tails (e.g., Gaussian), which are typically used for initialization, a single stable FP exists for broad types of architectures. In contrast, for heavy tail distributions (e.g., Cauchy), which typically appear in trained DNNs, a number of FPs emerge. We further observe that these FPs are stable attractors and their basins of attraction partition the domain of input vectors. Finally, we observe an intriguing non-monotone dependence of the number of fixed points $Q(L)$ on the DNNs' depth $L$. The above results were first obtained for untrained DNNs with two types of distributions at initialization and then verified by considering DNNs in which the heavy tail distributions arise in training.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Lightweight Method for Generating Multi-Tier JIT Compilation Virtual Machine in a Meta-Tracing Compiler Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17460v3)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta-compiler frameworks, such as RPython and Graal/Truffle, generate high-performance virtual machines (VMs) from interpreter definitions. Although they generate VMs with high-quality just-in-time (JIT) compilers, they still lack an important feature that dedicated VMs (i.e., VMs that are developed for specific languages) have, namely \emph{multi-tier compilation}. Multi-tier compilation uses light-weight compilers at early stages and highly-optimizing compilers at later stages in order to balance between compilation overheads and code quality. We propose a novel approach to enabling multi-tier compilation in the VMs generated by a meta-compiler framework. Instead of extending the JIT compiler backend of the framework, our approach drives an existing (heavyweight) compiler backend in the framework to quickly generate unoptimized native code by merely embedding directives and compile-time operations into interpreter definitions. As a validation of the approach, we developed 2SOM, a Simple Object Machine with a two-tier JIT compiler based on RPython. 2SOM first applies the tier-1 threaded code generator that is generated by our proposed technique, then, to the loops that exceed a threshold, applies the tier-2 tracing JIT compiler that is generated by the original RPython framework. Our performance evaluation that runs a program with a realistic workload showed that 2SOM improved, when compared against an RPython-based VM, warm-up performance by 15\%, with merely a 5\% reduction in peak performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECOOP...</summary><p>ECOOP 2025.

This class of functions has enabled the development of non-linear statistical concepts, such as distance variance, distance covariance, and distance correlation. The main obstacle is the computational burden associated with $\mathcal{\varepsilon}$-statistics is substantial, particularly when the data are multivariate. To address this challenge, we have developed a method to significantly reduce memory requirements and accelerate computations, thus facilitating the analysis of large data sets. The following cases are demonstrated: univariate and multivariate distance variance, distance covariance, partial distance correlation, energy distance, and hypothesis testing for the equality of univariate distributions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing lidar and camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in visually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data processing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer a cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging regardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers from sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this work, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph neural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in complex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the low-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such resource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources. We evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and autonomous navigation, in three different environments. Our results demonstrate strong reliability and generalizability, making RaGNNarok a robust solution for low-cost indoor mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[MILo: Mesh-In-the-Loop Gaussian Splatting for Detailed and Efficient Surface Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24096v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds, with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior, our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics simulations or animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

Most existing machine learning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each microstructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained foundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic microstructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a microstructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained state-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM) in two case studies on machine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on simulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys based on experimental data published in literature. Our results show the potential of foundational vision transformers for robust microstructure representation and efficient machine learning of microstructure--property relationships without the need for expensive task-specific training or fine-tuning of bespoke deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight Target-Speaker-Based Overlap Transcription for Practical Streaming ASR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20288v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Overlapping speech remains a major challenge for automatic speech recognition (ASR) in real-world applications, particularly in broadcast media with dynamic, multi-speaker interactions. We propose a light-weight, target-speaker-based extension to an existing streaming ASR system to enable practical transcription of overlapping speech with minimal computational overhead. Our approach combines a speaker-independent (SI) model for standard operation with a speaker-conditioned (SC) model selectively applied in overlapping scenarios. Overlap detection is achieved using a compact binary classifier trained on frozen SI model output, offering accurate segmentation at negligible cost. The SC model employs Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to incorporate speaker embeddings and is trained on synthetically mixed data to transcribe only the target speaker. Our method supports dynamic speaker tracking and reuses existing modules with minimal modifications. Evaluated on a challenging set of Czech television debates with 16% overlap, the system reduced WER on overlapping segments from 68.0% (baseline) to 35.78% while increasing total computational load by only 44%. The proposed system offers an effective and scalable solution for overlap transcription in continuous ASR services.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learning Point Correspondences In Radar 3D Point Clouds For Radar-Inertial Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18580v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using 3D point clouds in odometry estimation in robotics often requires finding a set of correspondences between points in subsequent scans. While there are established methods for point clouds of sufficient quality, state-of-the-art still struggles when this quality drops. Thus, this paper presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting robust point correspondences between pairs of noisy, sparse and unstructured 3D point clouds from a light-weight, low-power, inexpensive, consumer-grade System-on-Chip (SoC) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensor. Our network is based on the transformer architecture which allows leveraging the attention mechanism to discover pairs of points in consecutive scans with the greatest mutual affinity. The proposed network is trained in a self-supervised way using set-based multi-label classification cross-entropy loss, where the ground-truth set of matches is found by solving the Linear Sum Assignment (LSA) optimization problem, which avoids tedious hand annotation of the training data. Additionally, posing the loss calculation as multi-label classification permits supervising on point correspondences directly instead of on odometry error, which is not feasible for sparse and noisy data from the SoC radar we use. We evaluate our method with an open-source state-of-the-art Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) framework in real-world Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights and with the widely used public Coloradar dataset. Evaluation shows that the proposed method improves the position estimation accuracy by over 14 % and 19 % on average, respectively.

| **[Global Microprocessor Correctness in the Presence of Transient Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17154v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Correctness for microprocessors is generally understood to be conformance with the associated instruction set architecture (ISA). This is the basis for one of the most important abstractions in computer science, allowing hardware designers to develop highly-optimized processors that are functionally "equivalent" to an ideal processor that executes instructions atomically. This specification is almost always informal, e.g., commercial microprocessors generally do not come with conformance specifications. In this paper, we advocate for the use of formal specifications, using the theory of refinement. We introduce notions of correctness that can be used to deal with transient execution attacks, including Meltdown and Spectre. Such attacks have shown that ubiquitous microprocessor optimizations, appearing in numerous processors for decades, are inherently buggy. Unlike alternative approaches that use non-interference properties, our notion of correctness is global, meaning it is single specification that: formalizes conformance, includes functional correctness and is parameterized by an microarchitecture. We introduce action skipping refinement, a new type of refinement and we describe how our notions of refinement can be decomposed into properties that are more amenable to automated verification using the the concept of shared-resource commitment refinement maps. We do this in the context of formal, fully executable bit- and cycle-accurate models of an ISA and a microprocessor. Finally, we show how light-weight formal methods based on property-based testing can be used to identify transient execution bugs.</p></details> |  |

Lightweight data-agnostic neural architecture search without training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01306v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) enables the automatic design of neural network models. However, training the candidates generated by the search algorithm for performance evaluation incurs considerable computational overhead. Our method, dubbed nasgraph, remarkably reduces the computational costs by converting neural architectures to graphs and using the average degree, a graph measure, as the proxy in lieu of the evaluation metric. Our training-free NAS method is data-agnostic and light-weight. It can find the best architecture among 200 randomly sampled architectures from NAS-Bench201 in 217 CPU seconds. Besides, our method is able to achieve competitive performance on various datasets including NASBench-101, NASBench-201, and NDS search spaces. We also demonstrate that nasgraph generalizes to more challenging tasks on Micro TransNAS-Bench-101.</p></details> |  |

Such models are light-weight and computationally efficient, allowing them to be trained on consumer laptops. SHRED-based models rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the temporal encoding and spatial decoding respectively. Despite the relatively simple structure of SHRED, they are able to predict chaotic dynamical systems on different physical, spatial, and temporal scales directly from a sparse set of sensor measurements. In this work, we improve SHRED by leveraging transformers (T-SHRED) for the temporal encoding which improves performance on next-step state prediction on large datasets. We also introduce a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) attention mechanism into T-SHRED to perform symbolic regression directly on the latent space as part of the model regularization architecture. Symbolic regression improves model interpretability by learning and regularizing the dynamics of the latent space during training. We analyze the performance of T-SHRED on three different dynamical systems ranging from low-data to high-data regimes. We observe that SINDy attention T-SHRED accurately predicts future frames based on an interpretable symbolic model across all tested datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Transactions of the Royal Society (Symbolic Regression in the Physical Sciences)</p></details> |

This paper develops an uncertainty quantification approach in the context of visual localization for autonomous driving, where locations are selected based on images. Key to our approach is to learn the measurement uncertainty using light-weight sensor error model, which maps both image feature and semantic information to 2-dimensional error distribution. Our approach enables uncertainty estimation conditioned on the specific context of the matched image pair, implicitly capturing other critical, unannotated factors (e.g., city vs highway, dynamic vs static scenes, winter vs summer) in a latent manner. We demonstrate the accuracy of our uncertainty prediction framework using the Ithaca365 dataset, which includes variations in lighting and weather (sunny, night, snowy). Both the uncertainty quantification of the sensor+network is evaluated, along with Bayesian localization filters using unique sensor gating method. Results show that the measurement error does not follow a Gaussian distribution with poor weather and lighting conditions, and is better predicted by our Gaussian Mixture model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning, revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably, persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps. Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap. Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 1 pseudo-code</p></details> |

The emergence of foundation models (FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization, replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real world medical applications.

We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions. Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>6th C...</summary><p>6th CLVISION ICCV Workshop accepted</p></details> |

The absence of ground truths for unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB) is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions. To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to WACV 2025 (Tucson, Arizona, USA), February 28-March 4 2025</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Pool-based Prompt Learning for Few-shot Class-incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09183v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks, revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding, we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively learning novel sessions.

| **[Mind the Gap: Preserving and Compensating for the Modality Gap in CLIP-Based Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09118v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models. Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring additional replay data.

| **[The Bayesian Approach to Continual Learning: An Overview](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08922v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is an online paradigm where a learner continually accumulates knowledge from different tasks encountered over sequential time steps. Importantly, the learner is required to extend and update its knowledge without forgetting about the learning experience acquired from the past, and while avoiding the need to retrain from scratch. Given its sequential nature and its resemblance to the way humans think, continual learning offers an opportunity to address several challenges which currently stand in the way of widening the range of applicability of deep models to further real-world problems. The continual need to update the learner with data arriving sequentially strikes inherent congruence between continual learning and Bayesian inference which provides a principal platform to keep updating the prior beliefs of a model given new data, without completely forgetting the knowledge acquired from the old data. This survey inspects different settings of Bayesian continual learning, namely task-incremental learning and class-incremental learning. We begin by discussing definitions of continual learning along with its Bayesian setting, as well as the links with related fields, such as domain adaptation, transfer learning and meta-learning. Afterwards, we introduce a taxonomy offering a comprehensive categorization of algorithms belonging to the Bayesian continual learning paradigm. Meanwhile, we analyze the state-of-the-art while zooming in on some of the most prominent Bayesian continual learning algorithms to date. Furthermore, we shed some light on links between continual learning and developmental psychology, and correspondingly introduce analogies between both fields. We follow that with a discussion of current challenges, and finally conclude with potential areas for future research on Bayesian continual learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[BayesTTA: Continual-Temporal Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models via Gaussian Discriminant Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08607v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting; entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data, adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment. We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets. Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining efficiency.

| **[Embedding Space Allocation with Angle-Norm Joint Classifiers for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09250v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continually learn new classes from only a few samples without forgetting previous ones, requiring intelligent agents to adapt to dynamic environments. FSCIL combines the characteristics and challenges of class-incremental learning and few-shot learning: (i) Current classes occupy the entire feature space, which is detrimental to learning new classes. (ii) The small number of samples in incremental rounds is insufficient for fully training. In existing mainstream virtual class methods, for addressing the challenge (i), they attempt to use virtual classes as placeholders. However, new classes may not necessarily align with the virtual classes. For the challenge (ii), they replace trainable fully connected layers with Nearest Class Mean (NCM) classifiers based on cosine similarity, but NCM classifiers do not account for sample imbalance issues. To address these issues in previous methods, we propose the class-center guided embedding Space Allocation with Angle-Norm joint classifiers (SAAN) learning framework, which provides balanced space for all classes and leverages norm differences caused by sample imbalance to enhance classification criteria. Specifically, for challenge (i), SAAN divides the feature space into multiple subspaces and allocates a dedicated subspace for each session by guiding samples with the pre-set category centers. For challenge (ii), SAAN establishes a norm distribution for each class and generates angle-norm joint logits. Experiments demonstrate that SAAN can achieve state-of-the-art performance and it can be directly embedded into other SOTA methods as a plug-in, further enhancing their performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to Neural Networks</p></details> |
| **[Mamba-CL: Optimizing Selective State Space Model in Null Space for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15469v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Learning (CL) aims to equip AI models with the ability to learn a sequence of tasks over time, without forgetting previously learned knowledge. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba model, have achieved notable success in computer vision. Building on the strengths of SSMs, this study explores leveraging the Mamba model for CL. Therefore, we introduce Mamba-CL, a framework that continuously fine-tunes the core SSMs of the large-scale Mamba foundation model by updating parameters orthogonal to the feature subspace of previous tasks. This approach theoretically guarantees the consistency objective aiming to preserves consistent output for each SSM module across both previous and current tasks, so as to overcome catastrophic forgetting issue. Specifically, we achieve this goal by deducing the overall consistency constraints on four key time-invariant parameters in the Mamba model, streamlining its recurrent state-space structure and non-linear discretization process in SSM. In practice, we apply the null-space projection to efficiently implement the orthogonality within Mamba model. Extensive experiments on four class-incremental benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of Mamba-CL for anti-forgetting, achieving superior performances to state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Rethinking Query-based Transformer for Continual Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07831v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study, however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks, settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Balancing the Past and Present: A Coordinated Replay Framework for Federated Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07712v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[OVOR: OnePrompt with Virtual Outlier Regularization for Rehearsal-Free Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04129v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have shown that by using large pre-trained models along with learnable prompts, rehearsal-free methods for class-incremental learning (CIL) settings can achieve superior performance to prominent rehearsal-based ones. Rehearsal-free CIL methods struggle with distinguishing classes from different tasks, as those are not trained together. In this work we propose a regularization method based on virtual outliers to tighten decision boundaries of the classifier, such that confusion of classes among different tasks is mitigated. Recent prompt-based methods often require a pool of task-specific prompts, in order to prevent overwriting knowledge of previous tasks with that of the new task, leading to extra computation in querying and composing an appropriate prompt from the pool. This additional cost can be eliminated, without sacrificing accuracy, as we reveal in the paper. We illustrate that a simplified prompt-based method can achieve results comparable to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods equipped with a prompt pool, using much less learnable parameters and lower inference cost. Our regularization method has demonstrated its compatibility with different prompt-based methods, boosting those previous SOTA rehearsal-free CIL methods' accuracy on the ImageNet-R and CIFAR-100 benchmarks.

| **[Enhancing Plasticity for First Session Adaptation Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11482v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large pre-trained models (PTMs) into Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) has facilitated the development of computationally efficient strategies such as First-Session Adaptation (FSA), which fine-tunes the model solely on the first task while keeping it frozen for subsequent tasks. Although effective in homogeneous task sequences, these approaches struggle when faced with the heterogeneity of real-world task distributions. We introduce Plasticity-Enhanced Test-Time Adaptation in Class-Incremental Learning (PLASTIC), a method that reinstates plasticity in CIL while preserving model stability. PLASTIC leverages Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) by dynamically fine-tuning LayerNorm parameters on unlabeled test data, enabling adaptability to evolving tasks and improving robustness against data corruption. To prevent TTA-induced model divergence and maintain stable learning across tasks, we introduce a teacher-student distillation framework, ensuring that adaptation remains controlled and generalizable. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PLASTIC consistently outperforms both conventional and state-of-the-art PTM-based CIL approaches, while also exhibiting inherent robustness to data corruptions.

| **[Integrating Dual Prototypes for Task-Wise Adaption in Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17766v3)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to acquire new classes while conserving historical knowledge incrementally. Despite existing pre-trained model (PTM) based methods performing excellently in CIL, it is better to fine-tune them on downstream incremental tasks with massive patterns unknown to PTMs. However, using task streams for fine-tuning could lead to \textit{catastrophic forgetting} that will erase the knowledge in PTMs. This paper proposes the Dual Prototype network for Task-wise Adaption (DPTA) of PTM-based CIL. For each incremental learning task, an adapter module is built to fine-tune the PTM, where the center-adapt loss forces the representation to be more centrally clustered and class separable. The dual prototype network improves the prediction process by enabling test-time adapter selection, where the raw prototypes deduce several possible task indexes of test samples to select suitable adapter modules for PTM, and the augmented prototypes that could separate highly correlated classes are utilized to determine the final result. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the excellent performance of DPTA.

Existing methods, primarily based on regularization techniques like knowledge distillation, help preserve old knowledge but often face challenges in effectively integrating new knowledge, resulting in limited overall improvement. Endpoints Weight Fusion (EWF) method, while simple, effectively addresses some of these limitations by dynamically fusing the model weights from previous steps with those from the current step, using a fusion parameter alpha determined by the relative number of previously known classes and newly introduced classes. However, the simplicity of the alpha calculation may limit its ability to fully capture the complexities of different task scenarios, potentially leading to suboptimal fusion outcomes. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach called Adaptive Weight Fusion (AWF), which introduces an alternating training strategy for the fusion parameter, allowing for more flexible and adaptive weight integration. AWF achieves superior performance by better balancing the retention of old knowledge with the learning of new classes, significantly improving results on benchmark CISS tasks compared to the original EWF. And our experiment code will be released on Github.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Prototype Calibration of Vision-Language Models for Generalized Few-shot Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22979v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) aims to extend a segmentation model to novel classes with only a few annotated examples while maintaining performance on base classes. Recently, pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve generalization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning. However, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic, limiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples, particularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we propose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over multi-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive prototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype calibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable visual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive representation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning techniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these calibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and uncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to limited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental results on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed FewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS and class-incremental setting.

Existing methods face a critical dilemma: static architectures rely on a fixed parameter space to learn from data that arrive sequentially, prone to overfitting to the current session, while dynamic architectures require the expansion of the parameter space continually, leading to increased complexity. In this study, we explore the potential of Selective State Space Models (SSMs) for FSCIL. Mamba leverages its input-dependent parameters to dynamically adjust its processing patterns and generate content-aware scan patterns within a fixed architecture. This enables it to configure distinct processing for base and novel classes, effectively preserving existing knowledge while adapting to new ones. To leverage Mamba's potential for FSCIL, we design two key modules: First, we propose a dual selective SSM projector that dynamically adjusts the projection parameters based on the intermediate features for dynamic adaptation. The dual-design structurally decouples base and novel class processing with a frozen base branch, employing a frozen base branch to maintain robust base-class features and a dynamic incremental branch that adaptively learns distinctive feature shifts for novel classes. Second, we develop a class-sensitive selective scan mechanism to guide dynamic adaptation of the incremental branch. It minimizes the disruption to base-class representations caused by training on novel data, and meanwhile, forces the selective scan to perform in distinct patterns between base and novel classes. Extensive experiments on miniImageNet, CUB-200, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that Mamba-FSCIL achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |
